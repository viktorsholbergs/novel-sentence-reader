"Zhang Tieshan... Zhao Siyao... Ye Lei..."
The steward of Jin Yun Valley recited the names of dozens of people in one breath.
The people whose names were called out were overjoyed, harboring aspirations for the immortal path in the future.
"My name isn't on the list... Did they forget to call it?"
Lin Yi bit his lip, finding it hard to believe.
Seventeen years old, Qi Refining Third Stage, low-grade spiritual roots, he should have met the standard.
It wasn't only Lin Yi whose name wasn't called out. Lan Chang'an and Li Ergou also didn't pass the entrance assessment.
"All others, leave the mountain gate immediately!"
The steward of Jin Yun Valley's expression was cold as he led the selected young talents away.
The remaining hundred-plus youths, including Lin Yi and Li Ergou, had dim expressions, feeling resentful.
Lan Chang'an remained calm, having expected this outcome.
The age limit for Jin Yun Valley's entrance assessment was not to exceed eighteen years old.
Lan Chang'an was just at the upper limit.
If he had waited a few more months, he wouldn't even have qualified for the assessment. Although his performance in the third stage was outstanding, his age and cultivation level were too far behind.
With a bone age close to 18 and only at the Qi Refining First Stage, his potential was simply too low for the sect to consider. Even if his spiritual roots barely reached medium-grade, Jin Yun Valley wouldn't have taken notice.
...
"Big Brother Lan, does this mean we can't cultivate immortality anymore?"
On the way down the mountain, Li Ergou had a mournful expression, looking as if his dreams had been shattered.
"Don't be too disheartened. As long as you have spiritual roots, you can still cultivate. Worst case scenario, we'll become wandering cultivators."
Lan Chang'an comforted him.
In reality, he knew that with Li Ergou's background and aptitude, becoming a wandering cultivator would be extremely difficult.
Lan Chang'an wasn't worried, though. With two lifetimes of cultivation memories, he was confident, despite the rough start.
Guided by two disciples from Jin Yun Valley, the group descended the mountain together.
Passing by a lake brimming with spiritual energy.
Lan Chang'an took a deep breath, looking at the reflection of the young man on the lake's surface.
In this life, his body had symmetrical and muscular lines, calluses on his palms from martial training.
His face was rugged, with sharp features, and his eyes as black as ink.
Strong and robust, skilled in martial arts.
He wasn't a delicate weakling.
Lan Chang'an nodded inwardly, satisfied with his current physique.
"Senior Brother Yu, considering my performance in the assessment, why was I eliminated?"
On the way down the mountain, Lin Yi complained to a young disciple of Jin Yun Valley.
Lin Yi had used his connections from the noble family before the entrance assessment to arrange things with Jin Yun Valley.
"Junior Brother, you performed poorly in the third stage, the Illusion Heart Platform. According to the sect's rules, unless you have superior-grade spiritual roots or above, you won't be accepted into the sect."
Senior Brother Yu conveyed the message, inwardly sneering. How could Jin Yun Valley take in someone with such ordinary aptitude and weak mental state?
"The Illusion Heart Platform?" Lin Yi felt indignant, subconsciously glancing at Lan Chang'an.
Lan Chang'an had performed so well in the third stage, yet he was still eliminated?
Thinking of this, Lin Yi felt somewhat relieved. After all, he was the illegitimate son of a noble family. Backed by secular power, even if he wasn't accepted by the sect, his future would still be much better than that of an ordinary wandering cultivator.
That being said. As they walked out of the Jin Yun Valley gate. Gazing at the gradually shrouded mist, the ethereal peaks, and the flying spiritual cranes...
Lin Yi remained silent for a long time before sighing:
"A gate separates the mortal from the immortal!"
He understood that even with the backing of secular power, his future would be vastly different from that of the disciples of immortal sects who stood high above.
"Zhao Siyao..."
Thinking back to his attempts to win over the beautiful and talented lady.
Even fantasizing about standing side by side in the immortal sect and pursuing immortality together. However, as they stepped out of this gate.
Zhao Siyao became an unreachable goddess of the heavens.
In just one day, the gap in their lives had become so vast.
...
"Brother Lan, Brother Li, our Marquis Guang'an's mansion has some cultivation resources. Would you two like to come with me and develop in the secular world?"
Walking out of the gate, Lin Yi's attitude changed, and he seemed less arrogant.
Lin Yi knew that it was difficult to thrive as a wandering cultivator, so it was best to stick together for warmth. He tried to recruit Lan Chang'an and Li Ergou using the power of the noble family.
"I'll follow Brother Lan's lead."
Li Ergou grinned foolishly, revealing his yellowed teeth.
He didn't have much of an opinion but trusted Lan Chang'an.
Before, Lin Yi had shown no respect for him, rather displaying a hint of disdain. Although he was an ignorant peasant, it didn't mean he had no thoughts of his own.
Compared to Lin Yi, Lan Chang'an was more grounded, speaking colloquially and treating Li Ergou with some care, easily gaining his trust.
"Does the Marquis Guang'an mansion have a first-grade spiritual vein?"
Lan Chang'an asked casually.
"Not... not really."
Lin Yi's expression changed.
He realized that he couldn't deceive Lan Chang'an so easily!
A first-grade spiritual vein could be used by cultivators in the Foundation Establishment period to accelerate cultivation. There was a world of difference compared to the "spiritually poor areas" of the secular world.
"In that case, I'll pass." Lan Chang'an was straightforward. He waved his hand, interrupting Lin Yi's attempt to persuade them.
Without a first-grade spiritual vein, the Marquis Guang'an mansion could only provide some incomplete cultivation techniques or mundane treasures like gold, silver, and precious medicinal herbs. These things were meaningless to Lan Chang'an.
"Haha! Does Brother Lan need a first-grade spiritual vein? My Mu family has a second-grade spiritual vein. Would you like to join us?"
A hearty voice came from the direction of the foot of the mountain. The speaker was a middle-aged man in a green robe, with a fair complexion and an elegant demeanor.
"Qi Refining Eighth Stage?"
Lan Chang'an's powerful soul instinctively sensed the fluctuations of mana emanating from the man, making him vigilant. However, in front of Jin Yun Valley's mountain gate, outsiders dared not act recklessly.
A second-grade spiritual vein, Mu family?
Lan Chang'an's eyes flashed slightly as he speculated about the man's identity.
"How should I address you, Senior?"
"I am Mu Maode, the head of the Mu Family of cultivation in Feiyue Lake. I am recruiting young cultivators to join us." The middle-aged man's expression was friendly as he explained his intentions.
"So it's Senior Mu." Lan Chang'an nodded and noticed a glint of light in Mu Maode's eyes as he looked at him.
"From what I know, don't cultivation clans generally not cultivate outside bloodlines?" Someone in the crowd voiced their doubt.
Most of the youths participating in the sect's assessment came from the lower levels of society, at least compared to the cultivation world. Most were from noble families, wealthy merchants, or even the descendants of cultivation families.
"In recent years, our Mu family has suffered losses and needs to replenish with new blood, hence this special case. Of course, we aren't recruiting the offspring of nobles or cultivation families."
The Mu family head had already investigated the backgrounds of the youths participating in the assessment. He glanced at Lan Chang'an, the only one with a medium-grade spiritual root, then scanned the rest of the youths.
Speaking loudly, he announced, "My Mu family has ten spots! We're recruiting young cultivators, providing spiritual vein cultivation grounds, cultivation techniques, and..." Hearing this, those without backgrounds couldn't help but be moved.
Having the support of a cultivation family was much better than being a wandering cultivator.
"No pain, no gain. Senior Mu, could you please clarify what we need to provide in return for the resources from noble families?" Lan Chang'an spoke frankly.
The Mu family head looked at him with some surprise before chuckling softly, "I didn't expect such insight from someone so young. Let me be clear."
"I see you, Junior Brother Lan, as a remarkable talent who is destined for greatness. Our clan has many well-educated young ladies from which you may choose one or several to be your wives or concubines." Hearing this, Li Ergou's eyes widened, his chapped lips moving silently.
"Is such a good thing possible?" Coming from a peasant background, he barely had enough to eat or clothes to keep his body warm. It was a luxury for him to marry an ordinary-looking woman in this lifetime. Let alone marry an educated and beautiful lady.
Facing the enthusiastic recruitment from the Mu family head. Lan Chang'an, who possessed memories of two lifetimes, remained unruffled, though he sneered inwardly. Was it that the Mu family valued his spiritual roots?
No!
They were eyeing his kidneys...
...
As expected, the Mu family head revealed his actual intents at the end of his recruitment speech.
"Our requirement is this: Young cultivators who join the Mu family and bear offspring with our clan's women must pass the Mu family's surname, especially if their offspring is born with spiritual roots!"
"Isn't this considered marrying into the family?" Li Ergou blurted out in surprise.
The Mu family head didn't mind and smiled, "Joining members need to father ten offspring. If you can leave behind a child with a medium-grade spiritual root or two children with low-grade spiritual roots for our clan, it will count as fulfilling the condition. In return, the Mu family will provide you with cultivation grounds, cultivation techniques, and a certain amount of spiritual rice and elixirs each year."
After hearing the conditions, Lan Chang'an shook his head inwardly. Was this considered marrying into the family? It was merely a disguised form of a breeding method.
"Big Brother Lan, do you think this is reliable?" Li Ergou looked eagerly at Lan Chang'an, evidently tempted.
"Are you not bothered by marrying into a family? You have several brothers in your own family"
Li Ergou scratched his head, looking embarrassed. He then lowered his voice, saying somewhat excitedly:
"Big Brother Lan! We can cultivate, have a place to live, and even get married and have children... Isn't this a great deal?"
