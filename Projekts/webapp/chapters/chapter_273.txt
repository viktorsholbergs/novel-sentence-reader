Yu Xiaogui and Fei Wangbai had struggled against each other both openly and secretly on the lake for many years, so Yu Xiaogui was well aware of Fei Wangbai's true character. He knew that Fei Wangbai was a smiling tiger, one who spoke honeyed words but hid a sword behind his back.
Seeing Fei Wangbai's attitude now, he was greatly alarmed. Without another word, he swiftly rode the wind away, not even bothering to leave a harsh word behind, leaving behind only his hastily retreating silhouette for the two to see.
The two did not stop him, standing in the air as the members of the Li Family cheered below. Fei Wangbai cupped his fist and smiled, saying, "Congratulations, Brother Tongya! And of course… Many thanks to you!"
Li Tongya understood the implication of his words, knowing that the Fei Family must have made a substantial profit from the Milin Prefecture marketplace. He cupped his fist in return and replied, "Brother Wangbai, your timely arrival was most appreciated. Thank you!"
Wu Shaoyun, who had been standing awkwardly as a spectator, had watched Yu Xiaogui leave without a word and now finally saw his chance to speak. He approached with a somewhat embarrassed smile and introduced himself, saying, "I am Wu Shaoyun from the Wu Family in the southern prefecture. Greetings to you both, fellow Daoists!"
Wu Shaoyun had hesitated earlier, not daring to assist Yu Xiaogui out of fear of Li Chejing's might. Although he had not helped, he had shown deference, so Li Tongya responded courteously, speaking softly.
"Greetings, fellow Daoist!"
Wu Shaoyun's awkwardness had eased slightly seeing Li Tongya's politeness. Unsure of what to say next, he finally spoke, somewhat dejectedly.
"To seize opportunities and spirit items, one must engage in combat… If it results in death, that is fate, and no one can be blamed. I came here upon receiving news and had to inquire to set my mind at ease. I bear no ill will toward you..."
His words were clever, subtly explaining and expressing a desire to resolve grievances. Li Tongya, not wishing to make enemies, only nodded gently. He rarely acted out of greed, mostly responding only to threats, but sixty years of cultivation had occasionally seen him overcome by such desires. Wu Shaoyun's words relieved him, and he returned the courtesy with a cupped fist.
The two said no more. Wu Shaoyun offered a few polite remarks and also invited them to visit the Wu Family in the future, and then rode the wind away. Fei Wangbai also cupped his fist, and Li Tongya, after a deep look at him, finally spoke, "Though your family has gained much from the Yu Family's accumulated wealth, you have destroyed the marketplace and killed many members of the Yu Family, making a bitter enemy of Yu Xiaogui. Be cautious of revenge."
Fei Wangbai, unaware of Yu Yufeng's death, nodded deeply in agreement with Li Tongya's words. "Yu Yufeng is indeed formidable, unmatched on this lake. It is truly terrifying. I will restrain my disciples. However..." his voice trailed off.
Fei Wangbai's expression turned resolute as he solemnly cupped his fist and said, "The enmity between our families and the Yu Family is now as deep as the sea. There is also Yu Muxian within their ranks. I must ask the Sword Immortal for his continued protection..."
Li Tongya's heart skipped a beat.
"I understand, Brother Wangbai. Take care of your clan," he said simply.
Fei Wangbai still feared Yu Yufeng's retaliation, but Li Tongya knew the Yu Family's loss was immense. It would take decades for them to recover, making it difficult for them to even maintain pressure on the eastern coastal families, let alone seek revenge. Outwardly, he nodded in agreement, accompanying Fei Wangbai a bit further before riding the wind back to Mount Huazhong.
The soldiers on the mountain stood in silence, forming two orderly rows. As Li Tongya stood before the hall, they kneeled with a clang. Li Xuanxuan, smiling, hurried to greet him, saying respectfully, "Second Uncle has repelled the strong enemies and protected the clan. Your divine might is awe-inspiring! We are deeply grateful."
Li Tongya burst into laughter, waving his sleeve to interrupt Li Xuanxuan's words. "You rascal, always so formal!"
Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling, standing behind him, both laughed at his words. Li Xuanxuan then straightened up, unable to hide the joy on his face. Li Xuanling stepped forward and said, "We have collected the An Family's treasures. According to An Zheyan's account, there are thirty-seven Spirit Stones, six Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts, and five spirit items, all at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. We also obtained a Qi Cultivation Realm formation plate known as the Five Qi Return Formation. Though not top-tier, it can be used as a protective formation for the mountains."
"Excellent!" Li Tongya nodded and instructed, "The terrain of Mount Yuting is steep and lofty, with weak spirit veins. There is no need to prioritize it; just set up a basic formation there. Place this formation on the spiritual qi-abundant flat land on Mount Huazhong. As for Mount Huaqian..."
He waved his hand and gestured to Li Xuanfeng below, speaking warmly. "Xuanfeng, go to Lixia Prefecture and invite Liu Changdie over to examine the earth vein and terrain of Mount Huaqian. Have him prepare the formation."
"Understood!" Li Xuanfeng nodded obediently before slinging his longbow over his shoulder, quickly riding the wind away.
Li Tongya stroked his beard and instructed, "The news of the attack on Mount Huazhong has not yet spread. Send someone to Eastern Mount Yue to order Shamoli to come to Mount Lijing… I want to take a good look at the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique for Qinghong."
"As for An Zheyan..." Li Tongya paused, stepping onto the stone steps and into the spacious hall. It was desolate and quiet, the stone pillars intricately carved, the air filled with the pungent smell of blood. The flickering lights cast a dim glow around him, accompanied by faint, mournful wails.
Drip... Drip…
Thick blood slowly dripped down. An Zheyan held a knife-shaped dharma artifact, gently slicing a piece of flesh as thin as a cicada's wing, nearly transparent. He lifted it with the small knife, placed it in his mouth, and swallowed it in two bites.
"Ah..."
An Zheyu was beyond recognition at this point, his thin membrane of muscle clinging to his white bones, hanging like a sculpture from the beam. His heart and other organs, still faintly pulsating, covered by a translucent membrane, hanging downward. They were all dripping blood that reached Li Tongya's feet, only to be repelled by the water-repelling ability of his Boundless Ocean immortal foundation.
Li Tongya stared blankly at the suspended An Zheyu, his serpent-like brows revealing chilling malice, as if the person hanging before him was someone he loathed deeply.
For a moment, he was speechless.
Everyone fell silent. Several younger disciples looked uncomfortable while Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan frowned at the sight. Only Li Yuanjiao's eyes shone brightly, staring intently at An Zheyu.
An Zheyan, oblivious to the others, grabbed An Zheyu's hair and carefully cut it. An Zheyu could only whimper pitifully, his sculpted body trembling slightly. His eyelids and cheeks were now gone, and his blood-red eyes seemed ready to fall out of their sockets at any moment.
Li Xuanxuan's face was grim, but seeing Li Tongya's thoughtful expression, he dared not reprimand An Zheyan. Suddenly remembering something, he whispered in Li Tongya's ear.
"We paired An Zheyan with Li Feiruo, who is now pregnant. We must inform him immediately… An Zheyan likely doesn't know this yet."
Li Tongya, snapped out of his daze by Li Xuanxuan's somber reminder, shook his head as if waking from a dream. He sighed deeply, and with a sweep of his long sleeve, sent a burst of mana striking An Zheyan's abdomen.
An Zheyan was immediately thrown sideways, rolling three times on the ground before vomiting a mouthful of bloody filth. It was a disgusting and horrifying mix of pieces of flesh and skin, and the sight of it caused everyone's eyelids to twitch.
An Zheyan's mouth was full of blood and he had on a dazed expression, seeming to be slipping into deep delirium.
"He is far gone..." Li Xuanling muttered softly. However, he saw his father, Li Tongya, shake his head.
Li Tongya stepped forward, lifted An Zheyan by the collar, and roared like thunder in his ear, "An Zheyan! Li Feiruo is pregant!"
These words, which had been infused with mana, made An Zheyan tremble, blood trickling from his ears. Li Tongya released his grip, and An Zheyan collapsed to his knees with a thud. The Qi Cultivator of the sixth heavenly layer began vomiting once more while crying and laughing all at once, tumbling about on the ground until he was covered in blood and filth.
Li Tongya flicked his fingers, sending forward a force that killed An Zheyu instantly. The agonized head fell limp before a large blot of black-red blood flowed from his nasal cavity, splattering on the ground.
The hall fell into a profound silence, the eerie stillness accentuated by the autumn wind, leaving everyone engulfed in an unspeakable sense of suffocation.
