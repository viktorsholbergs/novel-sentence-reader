"Fate…" Li Yuanjiao muttered to himself as Li Tongya sheathed his sword, fastening the Qingche Sword to his waist for the first time. With a serious expression, he said, "Yuanjiao… the family will need your care from now on. If I go and do not return, you must lower your head and endure for a while. With the Xiao Family supporting us, at worst, we can cede Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting; it is of no great consequence."
Li Yuanjiao felt as though the sky was darkening and the world was collapsing around him. He said hoarsely, "Ancestor… the family… the family cannot do without you!"
Li Tongya slowly shook his head and spoke gently, "Xuanling is likely beyond saving, and Xuanfeng is stuck at the southern border. Let your father manage the marketplace; he should not come back and complicate matters…"
"You, Yuanxiu, and Yuanping are all capable of managing the family. You must be cautious… Qinghong is still in seclusion and does not need to be called out. She acts too hastily, pursuing immortality single-mindedly, which could lead to her downfall. Make sure she acts with caution!"
Seeing that Li Yuanjiao was listening attentively, Li Tongya nodded and advised, "Once this matter is settled, there should be many peaceful days ahead. After the death of the Yu Family's ancestor and the collapse of their marketplace, Yu Muxian, despite having many connections within the sect, remained passive and did not even utter a word. He doesn't seem to care much for his clan and is unlikely to offend the Xiao Family. You needn't worry about him."
"Yes… Jiao'er will keep your words in mind," Li Yuanjiao replied. His eyes shone brightly as he asked, "Ancestor, what about the Azure Pond Sect?"
At the mention of this name, Li Tongya's expression turned complex. He said softly, "The Azure Pond Sect has entrenched itself in Jiangnan for hundreds of years. Its background is far deeper than we can see, with intricate interests and ruthless methods of suppression and slaughter. It is not something that can be opposed in a single lifetime. Yuan Huyuan was right; we must climb onto the Azure Pond's table rather than fall into its bowl. However, my generation has an unresolvable blood feud with Azure Pond, making reconciliation impossible. After I am gone, you must send our descendants into the sect. Even if they become servants or sacrifices, it is the only way for the family to secure a future!"
Tears fell silently as Li Yuanjiao nodded. Li Tongya grasped his hand, his gray hair fluttering lightly in the wind. Then, with a somber tone, he continued, "Remember, do not perform blood sacrifices, do not massacre innocents, and do not indulge in evil desires…"
Beside him, Li Yuanping's eyes were already red, unable to control himself any longer. Li Tongya took his thin arm, and a glow of mana appeared in his hand, erasing the bruises on Li Yuanping's arm. Feeling somewhat guilty, he said, "If our family had any precious elixirs to mend your root bones, you would not have to suffer this way…"
"Waaah…" Li Yuanping could not hold back anymore and began to cry hoarsely. Li Yuanjiao bit his lip, holding back his tears as he stood.
Li Tongya looked into his eyes and said softly, "If Yuanyun proves to be useless, do not indulge him. If he dares to engage in any murderous blood sacrifices, kill him."
Li Yuanjiao nodded, a glimmer of understanding flashing across his eyes. Despite never having left the mountain, his granduncle seemed to know everything about the world below. Li Yuanping, stifling his sobs and looking up with a flush of excitement on his pale face, said solemnly, "Rest assured, Granduncle. As long as Yuanjiao and I are here, the family will not fall into chaos!"
Li Tongya nodded approvingly then stood up, and with a hearty laugh, said, "Do not be too pessimistic. Though this journey is fraught with danger, there is also a chance of survival."
Adjusting the storage pouch at his waist, Li Tongya took out a pale blue jade box and handed it to Li Yuanjiao solemnly. Li Yuanjiao received it with both hands, and Li Tongya instructed, "This is the Sword Immortal's legacy—the Law of Celestial Moon, a Grade Five sword technique."
"The Sword Immortal's legacy?!"
Both brothers were astonished. Li Yuanjiao's legs went weak, holding the jade box carefully, as if fearing it might melt in his hands. He bowed respectfully and said in a deep voice, "Yuanjiao accepts the task!"
Li Yuanjiao understood that by entrusting him with this legacy, Li Tongya was passing on the responsibility of the Li Family to him. Feeling both terrified and uneasy, he watched as Li Tongya pointed at the jade box, flicked his finger, and retrieved two jade slips—one pale purple and one pure white.
Li Tongya explained, "The pale purple one is the Law of Celestial Moon. The pure white one contains my sixty years of swordsmanship notes on this manual, called the Law of Sexagenary Cycle Sword Manual. Keep them well and do not take them outside the mountain."
Li Yuanjiao nodded repeatedly. Li Tongya continued, "This jade box is also no ordinary item. It contains great space within and can store Purple Mansion Realm treasures."
Without saying any more, he took out most of the items from his storage pouch, leaving only a few healing and qi-replenishing pills. He nodded and finally said, "I'll be off now."
The two brothers quickly stood up and bowed in unison, saying respectfully, "Take care, Ancestor!"
A gentle breeze passed by, and when the two brothers straightened up, Li Tongya's figure was already gone from the courtyard. Li Yuanjiao hurriedly collected the items on the table, wiped his eyes, and walked back to the desk. Picking up a brush, he said solemnly, "I'll quickly write a letter to notify Father! If anything happens to the ancestor, we must keep a low profile in the marketplace!"
While the two brothers were busily making arrangements at the top of Mount Lijing, Li Tongya descended the mountain but did not immediately leave. He concealed his presence and descended the steps, making his way to the mountain's cemetery. Early morning dew covered everything in sight, moss on the stones was lush and green, and a light mist lingered, creating a tranquil and picturesque scene.
He wiped the tombstones of his brothers and then picked up a piece of rock. Using his finger as a chisel, he carved a stone tablet in just a few breaths. Li Tongya placed this tablet in a reserved spot and let sword aura flow from his fingers, delicately engraving patterns on the stone.
All of his brothers' tombstones had been erected by him. He initially intended to carve his own as well but, after thinking it over, waved off the sword aura and laughed self-deprecatingly.
"Erecting a tombstone for myself is quite a gloomy task… Better leave it for future generations…" he said.
With that, he took to the wind again, drifting northward.
On the banks of the great river…
An old man quietly untangled a mass of nets on a large rock. Li Xuanling had headed north several days ago, but the old man was not worried about him secretly fleeing. He continued to silently pull at his fishing net by the riverbank.
"The serpent dragon has emerged from its cave."
A man dressed in hemp clothes leisurely approached from below, carrying a white jade fishing rod on his shoulder. He stopped beside the old man and said gently, "Senior Si, it is time for us to leave as well!"
The old man glanced at him but did not respond to his words. Instead, he smiled and said, "The dark clouds are gathering... Xiao Xianyou is quite the meticulous planner. Everything has been prepared for you, and even the timing is impeccable. One cannot help but be impressed!"
Xiao Chuting looked at him deeply without speaking, then silently sat down to wait. The old man sighed and said, "If Xiao Xianyou had not been harmed by Chi Wei, he would have been a Golden Core seed."
Upon hearing this, Xiao Chuting finally spoke. "Senior, you jest. I heard that a Molten Metal Cave has emerged within your sect. That's quite rare. What made you decide to meddle with the Dao lineage of the Central Plains?"
"Nothing of the sort, just an external disciple." The Purple Mansion Realm elder surnamed Si shook his head nonchalantly and said, "A young fellow in the sect managed to cultivate it. The Dao Partners of Molten Metal Cave have been completely lost. Even if he succeeded, he would only reach early-stage Purple Mansion Realm, cut off from further progress. You need not be concerned."
Before long, radiant lights began to emerge by the riverbank. Various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators appeared one by one, some elegant and ethereal, others with sharp gazes and shimmering with divine light. A total of seven beams of light descended. Only then did the old man stand up shakily and say softly, "Since everyone is here, let us proceed together!"
