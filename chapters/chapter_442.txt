"It's definitely Green Essence Copper," Kong Yu confirmed.
"It must be nearby… Your family is really lucky to discover such rare spirit ores," he added, scooping up a bit of spring water and using a spell to analyze it.
After a few moments, he nodded in approval and said, "If we move this mountain, the shift in the earth vein will cut off the flow for about seven years. After that, the spring water will return, and the cold yin qi will be gone."
"Good!" Li Xuanxuan replied in delight with a nod.
Seven years isn't too long… the Li Family can wait!
He then continued, "This ore vein actually belongs to the Xiao Family, the immortal clan. Its production and reserves are meticulously recorded on Xianyou Peak. It has nothing to do with my Li Family..."
"That's unfortunate," Kong Yu replied with a regretful smile.
"Green Essence Copper can neutralize yang heat and enhance quality. I guess people like Daoist Master Chuting must have probably been aware of this years ago and snatched it up," he added.
Li Xijun, who had approached just in time to hear Kong Yu's remark, raised an eyebrow. Li Xuanxuan was also slightly taken aback but quickly responded, "You must be joking, fellow Daoist. The families on the eastern shore were all guided by the Xiao Family. There's no such thing as snatching… All the tributes my family collects are also reported to the Daoist Master…"
While saying that, Li Xuanxuan silently wondered, Why did he say that? Is he testing the relationship between my family and the Xiao Family?
Kong Yu was stunned by the response before smiling and saying sheepishly, "Please forgive me for speaking without thinking."
With the mountain selected, a group of cultivators from the Li Family gathered around. Kong Yu then produced twelve formation flags, handing them out to An Zheyan and the others.
He positioned each person around the lake and gave a single instruction.
"When you see the golden light, activate the formation."
Back on the shore, the Jade Court Guards had already moved the Rui Family members from the mountain. Kong Yu then retrieved a long, wide, white talisman from his robe. It was half a person's height, with something written in red ink on it.
"This is a pile of gravel, not a mountain."
At the end of the talisman was a small, bright red seal. Kong Yu explained, "This is the seal of Daoist Master Changxi, used specifically for moving mountains. It can deceive the earth vein, making the relocation process much easier."
Kong Yu stuck the talisman atop the mountain and then retrieved a handful of soft soil from his sleeve. He handed it to Li Xuanxuan while instructing, "When the earth vein begins to gush, infuse your mana into this Wuxi Sand and use it as a plug."
"If there's some leakage of Earth Vein Baleful Qi during the move, the Profound Peak Gate will handle it for your family," he added with a reassuring smile.
Li Xuanxuan took the spirit soil and replied, "Yes, please… fellow Daoist."
Kong Yu nodded and then untied the long golden rope from his waist. He carefully folded it and coiled it between his fingers, then began flying around the mountain and waving it around while chanting an incantation. Soon, the entire mountain and surrounding area was enveloped in a golden glow.
One by one, the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators of the Li Family ascended the mountain. Over a hundred of them took their positions, gripping the golden thread and sitting cross-legged, all channeling their mana into it.
Having completed the necessary preparations, Kong Yu breathed a sigh of relief and shouted, "Let's go!"
Immediately, sand and rocks were hurled into the air as a thick black mist enveloped the surroundings, and eerie wails echoed loudly as the sky darkened. Rui Family's peak, once lush with trees, trembled and vanished amidst the surging Earth Vein Baleful Qi.
"You call this some?!" Li Xuanxuan exclaimed in horror, having been caught off guard by the onslaught of black qi.
As the thick Earth Vein Baleful Qi surged forth, Li Xuanxuan hurriedly channeled his mana into the Wuxi Sand, throwing it into the chaotic scene.
"Go!" he yelled.
The spirit soil met the dark energy and expanded rapidly. Black rain began to fall, transforming the soil into mud upon contact with the ground. It rolled on the ground, gradually plugging the damaged earth vein.
Clouds of black baleful qi still lingered in the sky. Li Xuanxuan looked back to find that the Rui Family's Peak had disappeared, along with Kong Yu and the others. The landscape was now barren, revealing only gray-white rocks and soil.
"How miraculous!" Li Xuanxuan exclaimed in awe.
As he soared over the lake, he saw a new peak standing amidst it. The once verdant summit was now stripped of trees, with huts and structures reduced to rubble.
An Zheyan and the other Qi Cultivators sat cross-legged on the shore, their faces pale from exhaustion. More than a hundred Embryonic Breathing cultivators lay sprawled on the ground, their mana depleted and energy spent.
Kong Yu's face was as pale as paper, but he pushed through, not daring to pause for a second to even catch his breath. He took out a white jade bottle, soared into the sky, and used his dharma artifact to gather all the baleful qi. Once he was done, he landed with a sigh of relief.
Taking a moment to catch his breath, Kong Yu exhaled deeply and opened his eyes, then said to Li Xuanxuan, "This Earth Vein Baleful Qi belongs to the Profound Peak Gate. The remaining payment shall be sixty Spirit Stones, covering the costs for the Mountain Moving Talisman, Wuxi Sand, and labor fee... What do you think, fellow Daoist?"
I see, these people have had an ulterior motive all along!
Li Xuanxuan realized that the Profound Peak Gate's enthusiasm for relocating the mountain stemmed from their interest in harvesting the leaked baleful qi, which was likely very valuable for their alchemical techniques.
Reflecting on the baleful qi that had surged earlier, Li Xuanxuan wondered how many Spirit Stones it might be worth.
"Fellow Daoist Kong, you're quite the negotiator!" Li Xuanxuan said with a sigh, while Kong Yu responded with a shameless grin.
"The land left by the Rui Family will be barren for a hundred years. With the earth vein damaged and the spiritual energy depleted, it can only support some mortals," Kong Yu explained.
Moving mountains was extremely harmful to the earth vein and consumed vast amounts of mana. Fortunately, the lake was not far from the eastern shore, or it would have been impossible for the few Qi Cultivators to handle the relocation.
Li Xuanxuan had already expected all those consequences after seeing the baleful qi surging out from the earth vein earlier. Since this area was not his family's territory, he was not overly distressed. Nevertheless, he feigned anger and countered, "Why didn't you say so earlier? Fifty Spirit Stones!"
Kong Yu was momentarily taken aback and grumbled internally, Why the distress over this? It's not even your family's territory!
After some back-and-forth, Li Xuanxuan conceded and provided fifty-four Spirit Stones. Kong Yu accepted them with satisfaction.
Their relationship warmed considerably, and Kong Yu said with a grin, "Despite my modest cultivation, I've been moving mountains for fifty years and have mastered the craft, Brother. Based on my experience, the lake bed will naturally rise in a few years. Once the mountain's peak is raised, you'll see three or four small peaks forming around it due to the earth vein.
"Good!" Li Xuanxuan replied with a nod.
He arranged for Kong Yu to stay in the courtyard to recover. Meanwhile, the Rui Family had no place to live and was forced to stay in Yuting Town. Rui Qiongcuo remained silent, spending his days at Mount Yuting.
With no other options, Li Yuanping sent a letter to the Xiao Family, requesting that they absorb the Rui Family. The Rui Family's mining operations were naturally handed over to the Xiao Family as well.
Kong Yu stayed for several months to ensure the mountain remained stable before finally departing. As he left on the wind, he called out, "Brother Xuanxuan, if you need anything in the future, come visit me at Profound Peak Gate!"
Li Xuanxuan saw him off and then returned to the immortal mountain, which was now bustling with activity. The Li Family had cleared the fallen trees and constructed courtyards and pavilions, giving the area a lively atmosphere indeed.
Li Xijun and the others had been summoned to the mountain by Li Qinghong. Although Li Yuanjiao was still in seclusion, Li Qinghong insisted that they first decide on a name for the mountain and its cave dwelling.
