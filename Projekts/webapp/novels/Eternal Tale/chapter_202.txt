“Moo~~~” The deep cry of the big black ox stretched out, revealing a hint of reluctance in its eyes as if realizing that they might never share a meal again.
"Ancestor..."
The three felt as if their hearts had been struck hard. Suddenly, they felt a hand on their shoulders; Chen Xun had appeared behind them.
With a sudden smile, he gently pushed them forward with both hands and said, "Stop dawdling, get lost."
"Ancestor~"
The three were shocked, losing control of their bodies as a fierce wind roared past their ears, propelling them away from Nine Palaces Mountain, farther and farther.
As they turned back, they saw the two ancestors standing shoulder to shoulder, laughing heartily, and pointing at them until they were out of sight...
From this point on, these three would have to carve out their own paths in the chaotic world of cultivation.
At the mountain gate. Chen Xun and the big black ox stared into the distance for a long time. After all these years, it was the first time they had bid farewell to others, leaving them with mixed feelings.
"Old Ox, it's time for us to go too. Let’s say goodbye to Xuechen."
"Moo~"
With a single step, they disappeared without a sound, not even stirring the dust on the ground.
Over the past century, the immortal points in all five categories had maxed out, reaching the upper limit and unable to increase further.
Their current points: Strength 200 (140), Speed 200 (140), Essence of All Things 200 (140), Spiritual Energy 200 (140), Defense 200 (140).
Inside the Snow Listening Valley, atop the small snow peak.
The snow was heavy today, and the wind was harsh.
Jiang Xuechen poured tea for Chen Xun and asked, "Senior, are you preparing to head to the Endless Plains?"
“I haven’t decided yet, but when the time comes, I will go.” Chen Xun smiled calmly, his gaze distant. "I’ve been a guest at Nine Palaces Mountain for a long time. Staying longer would be rather unseemly."
The big black ox nodded in agreement. They had been well cared for, but staying too long might cause trouble for everyone.
"Understood," Jiang Xuechen said, smiling gently, though she felt a sense of loss. With no senior cultivators left in Moon Tower, they were on their own.
Moreover, she had once investigated the great war between the Qian and Wu Nations in the world of cultivation. The amount of time involved was astonishing...
She had come to realize that these two were not ordinary cultivators. She recalled an ancestor’s remark: “Rare are such esteemed individuals in the world of cultivation.”
"Alright then, we will go prepare."
"Senior."
Jiang Xuechen suddenly called out to Chen Xun.
"Please, go ahead," Chen Xun paused and sat back down.
Jiang Xuechen seemed to muster her courage, her voice rising, "I believe there is a way through the Endless Plains!"
"Hahaha..."
"Moo moo~~~"
Chen Xun and the big black ox gradually turned into light and shadow, their laughter drowning out the sound of the wind and snow.
Jiang Xuechen, her face calm, gazed at the now-empty seat opposite her, lost in thought.
Suddenly, a voice came through the wind and snow: "We will definitely cross the Tian Duan Plains!"
A smile spread across Jiang Xuechen's face as she nodded firmly, turning to look towards Flower Rain Valley.
The next day, sunlight bathed the land, and a purple aura rose in the east. In Nine Palaces Mountain, at Flower Rain Valley. Chen Xun and the big black ox had packed up their belongings and stood at the center of the giant ship.
“Old Ox, are you ready?”
A calm voice echoed as the big black ox looked at Chen Xun, exhaling heavily.
Chen Xun’s gaze deepened as he stood with one hand behind his back and the other with two fingers together in front of his chest.
The big black ox slowly rose, transforming its hooves into hands, and placed a palm on the deck.
“The final test and preparation begin.”
As Chen Xun spoke, a terrifying phantom with five heads and ten arms vaguely appeared behind him.
He stood calmly, his eyes shining like suns, his entire body ablaze with the energy of the five elements like divine flames.
At that moment, the giant ship, which had been silent in the valley, suddenly began to tremble.
The dark surface started to light up with patterns.
Chen Xun used his Nascent Soul to channel the ship's five-element energy, awakening the vessel as if it were a giant beast.
**Boom!**
**Boom!**
The entire valley shook violently as the energy of the five elements surged towards it like a tide.
The overwhelming spiritual pressure instantly enveloped the entire valley, spreading towards Nine Palaces Mountain.
"Moo!!"
The big black ox let out a furious roar, and a terrifying phantom, also with five heads and ten arms, appeared behind it.
The ship’s formations activated, and beams of light shot into the sky, scattering the spiritual energy and shaking the surroundings!
The Five Element Flags emerged from the light and shadow, settling at five points within the ship, drawing in the massive energy of the five elements from the heavens and earth.
**Buzz—**
A deep, vast humming filled the valley as the ground began to crack, soil flew, and rocks rolled.
Within Nine Palaces Mountain. A deafening uproar erupted, shaking the area, and nearly suffocating everyone as their gazes turned skyward towards Flower Rain Valley.
"S-senior sister, did the valley seal some terrible creature?!"
Someone cried out in panic as the spiritual energy in Nine Palaces Mountain seemed completely suppressed and stagnant.
At that moment, the entire Nine Palaces Mountain was trembling, some female cultivators weakly collapsing to the ground, feeling utterly powerless.
“What?! The ship... it’s ascending. Look!!”
“Oh my god... What is that thing?”
“And that strange... tree?!”
The entire Nine Palaces Mountain was filled with exclamations and awe, completely beyond their understanding.
**Buzz!**
**Buzz!**
A vast shadow loomed over Nine Palaces Mountain as a colossal ship slowly ascended, with a tree at its stern that blocked out the sun, its leaves shockingly black and white!
People all around gasped in shock.
The scene was too overwhelming.
This terrifying sight would be etched in the memories of many female cultivators for a lifetime, a strange phenomenon emerging in the world of cultivation.
In the Snow Listening Valley.
The sound of wind and snow ceased, leaving an eerie silence.
Xiang Jing stood beside Jiang Xuechen, her eyes trembling in disbelief at the distant scene, unable to detect any spiritual energy fluctuations!
Jiang Xuechen, stunned, stared at the distant sky, never having seen or heard of such a massive flying ship.
**Buzz—**
Suddenly, a vast, transparent ripple spread across the sky, radiating in all directions.
The giant ship had fully ascended, and with a thunderous roar, it vanished into the heavens in the blink of an eye.
Jiang Xuechen’s heart clenched momentarily, then her expression returned to normal as she respectfully cupped her hands, bidding farewell to the seniors.
Outside Nine Palaces Mountain.
Three young cultivators lingered for a long time, looking at the distant sky with awe, bowing deeply to send off their ancestors.
From that day on, Chen Xun and the big black ox completely vanished from the world of cultivation, never to reveal themselves again.
Even in their old home, the Five Elements Sect, no news was heard of them—whether they had perished or gone elsewhere.
Chen Xun and the big black ox became a forbidden legend in Nine Palaces Mountain, their power over the spiritual energy of heaven and earth becoming a tale too grand for the world of cultivation, leaving no cultivator daring to provoke them.
