Two days later, as the sun set in the west and dusk descended, a bright moon slowly rose, bringing forth a dazzling night sky filled with stars.
On the peaks of the major peaks of the Five Elements Sect, figures emerged one after another, crowded and close together. They all looked up at the sky, their eyes revealing a sense of awe.
The mountains appeared dark and iron-like, resembling the vast and majestic sea with its towering waves. Disciples of the Five Elements Sect were suspended in mid-air on their swords between the mountains, their expressions filled with disbelief.
Everywhere seemed to lose its hustle and bustle, and the serene night complemented the gentle moonlight, creating a tranquil atmosphere with absolute silence.
A shooting star pierced through the quiet night, leaving behind a beautiful, long arc in the sky. However, at this moment…!
More and more meteors appeared in the deep blue night sky. Countless meteors descended like flashing ribbons, illuminating the entire celestial dome. Although fleeting, the meteors became increasingly numerous, creating a magnificent spectacle that seemed to crack the silent night sky.
Silence!
The entire mountain range could hear a pin drop!
The already eerie atmosphere suddenly paused, creating an unsettling stillness!
In the mountains, disciples in various locations were frozen in shock, gazing at this magnificent scene in the sky.
Boom...
Finally, a tremendous roar echoed through the entire mountain range, filled with exclamations!
"Stars falling like rain in the night—isn't this the legendary scene?!"
"Extraterrestrial objects, this is an omen!"
"The disaster star surges like a spring; it's over... Is there a major event about to happen in the cultivation world?!"
"How is this possible!!"
...
Suddenly, the silence of the entire Jade Bamboo Mountain Range was shattered by the shouts from all directions, and waves of exclamations soared into the sky. Many disciples lost control and screamed.
On the top of each main peak, Golden Core stage cultivators stood in mid-air, frowning and observing.
They exchanged glances, their faces slightly changing, and then continued to focus their gaze on the sky.
Countless meteors continued to streak across the night sky, bursting with brilliance. They seemed to come from nowhere and go to nowhere, endless and dreamlike.
However, it seemed that the atmosphere in one place, the Lingyao Garden of the Huiquan Gorge, was out of sync with the tense atmosphere in various places in the mountains. A young man and a black ox were continuously standing on the ground, excitedly shouting. They seemed extremely happy, not lamenting.
The young man kept standing on the ground and shouting, while the black ox also excitedly mooed.
They seemed to be quite happy, rather than lamenting.
"What the heck..."
"Old ox! What the heck!!!"
"Moo moo!!!"
They hugged each other, extremely excited, constantly pointing at the countless beautiful meteors in the sky. It was a shocking sight they had never seen before!
"Junior Brother Chen, come out!"
"Junior Brother Chen, with such a spectacular scene, shouldn't we appreciate it together!"
Chen Xin's sound transmission talisman kept vibrating. He waved his hand, ripples spread out, and the prohibition was lifted. Two figures strolled over, and they were Shi Jing and Liu Yuan.
They remembered the promise they made at the beginning—that if they had the opportunity, they would travel together.
Shi Jing had starry eyebrows and starry eyes, with a powerful aura. There was still a faint aura of evil spirits lingering around him. It seemed that after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, the sect would also let these greenhouse flowers go out for training.
As for Liu Yuan, she casually draped her long hair over her back, lightly tied with a silver ribbon. She looked ethereal and elegant, and she matured a lot.
"Senior Brother Shi, Senior Sister Liu, hahaha, come on, come on!"
"Moo moo~"
Chen Xin and the big black ox joyfully spoke. At this moment, a wild chicken quietly passed by; they had just been playing around.
Unexpectedly, Chen Xin casually walked past it as if nothing happened, but suddenly a large hand reached out towards it. Chen Xin suddenly shouted, "Old Bull, set up a fire, set up a fire, quickly!"
"Moo!"
"Chirp!"
The mountain chicken's eyes widened in horror, flapping frantically. However, it couldn't escape the iron-like grip of that large hand.
With the proficiency of both the man and the bull, the fragrant aroma wafted in no time. They even used spells, leaving Shi Jing and Liu Yuan bewildered.
"Let's go; let's find a good place, and I'll go call Junior Brother Ji Kun."
"Ji Kun? Is he that prominent outer disciple in charge? I seem to have heard something about him."
"Yes, we and he are both from the Nine Stars Valley. We were on the same flying ship back then."
"Moo~"
They flew on their swords, swiftly passing through the Lingyao Garden.
Even the two guarding senior brothers outside the Lingyao Garden were stunned; they looked up at the sky with astonishment. This phenomenon had lasted too long; definitely not a good sign.
Not only in the Five Elements Sect, but also in the Ten Great Sects and various major cultivation sects, as well as among wandering cultivators, everyone's faces showed fear.
The legend of stars falling like rain was too common, but it was never a good sign.
From the upper echelons to the common people in Qian Nation, everyone walked out of their homes, their faces full of fear. This extraordinary phenomenon was rare in a thousand years and would surely leave a strong mark in history. This generation was witnessing history.
The ancestors of the Ten Great Sects all stood in the air after breaking through the barrier, and terrifying waves of spiritual power fluctuated in the sky above each sect.
They looked serious, as the appearance of such an anomaly was a sign of great misfortune!
This anomaly might not only affect Qian Nation and Wu Nation but also a few old ancestors, as vaguely speculated.
Could it be that the ancient, legendary place is in trouble?!
But in their circles, only a few sentences were passed down, and no one knew exactly where that place was, just that it seemed very far away.
Five Elements Sect, inside the mountain gate.
Countless disciples erupted in waves of huge cheers, making a loud and chaotic noise.
The violent clamor swept over the treetops inside the peaks, making a whistling sound under the night sky.
Ji Kun was also in the sect tonight. He stood in an open space, looking up at the sky, his brows showing a cold and stern expression—an appearance that discouraged strangers from approaching.
The outer disciples around him all shrank back, keeping a safe distance. Senior Brother Ji was indeed a formidable person, and his body carried a murderous aura that seemed to have killed countless cultivators.
Because of his handsome and icy appearance, a Foundation Establishment stage junior sister even came to him to propose forming a Daoist couple.
But the result was ruthlessly rejected, and Ji Kun left behind a cold and unfeeling remark:
"I already have someone to protect in my heart, and I can't promise you."
"I'll wait for you."
The junior sister left with this self-sorrowful sentence, leaving alone.
At this moment, Ji Kun was watching the magnificent phenomenon of the night sky. His heart was quite uncertain, and in the vast world of heaven and earth, life was truly small and insignificant.
Suddenly, the sound transmission talisman on his body emitted a faint light. He raised his eyebrows slowly, and his spiritual sense probed them, a slight smile appearing at the corner of his mouth.
A sword light rose, flying in a certain direction.
Shoo!
Shoo!
The outer disciple disciples around were shocked by the image that Senior Brother Ji had just passed by...
He was actually smiling. They couldn't imagine why such a person would be happy.
