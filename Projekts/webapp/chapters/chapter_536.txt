In the blink of an eye, Captain Chen felt an instant chilling sensation on his neck and when he reached for his waist, he found that the jade pendant he kept there had disappeared.
As he looked up again, a black flame materialized before him. He barely had time to raise his hands in defense before he was sent rolling on the ground. Xu Xiao glanced at him with disdain as he sneered coldly.
"All you cultivate are worthless techniques."
Captain Chen was shocked to be so easily overpowered by a cultivator at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Alarm bells rang in his mind—he suspected possession by a devil. As panic set in, he reached for his communication talisman to call for help.
"Seize!"
Xu Xiao raised a crimson command token, its surface adorned with ancient runes. With a sharp command, the token emitted a gentle red glow, shooting out like lightning right away.
Captain Chen let out two hoarse gasps before collapsing to his knees, his arms hanging limp by his sides. In a single move, his mind had been subdued, leaving him helpless.
Fearing that delaying would attract other Jade Court Guards, Xu Xiao acted swiftly. He formed a black seal in his hand, calmly stepping forward and pressing his palm into Captain Chen's chest.
Knowing that injuring or killing a Jade Court Guard would cause significant trouble, Xu Xiao had held back during their fight. Now, instead of striking a fatal blow, he planted a spell within Captain Chen's body. Once the seal took hold, he withdrew his token and watched as the man slowly regained consciousness.
Captain Chen emerged from his stupor, confused and disoriented. When clarity returned, his eyes filled with fear. Gripping his long blade, he appeared ready to fight once more.
Xu Xiao sneered, "Captain Chen, think carefully. We are in the same boat now."
The realization dawned on Captain Chen and he quickly scanned his body with his spiritual sense. With a heavy heart, he dropped his blade, despair washing over him. He thought bitterly to himself, I could die, but I can't doom my family along with me!
He reluctantly asked, "Who... who are you?"
Xu Xiao's expression remained calm.
"I know your family lives within the Li Family's territory… I will not force you into anything. Just pretend none of this happened. That way, you save your life and your family stays safe."
Xu Xiao's voice lowered, his tone measured and persuasive.
"Just turn a blind eye and let me leave. When the time comes, I will take Lingzhen and be gone without causing any trouble."
With his words precisely calibrated and the token subtly influencing Captain Chen's mind, Xu Xiao turned away confidently.
Caught in an agonizing inner struggle, Captain Chen watched Xu Xiao leave. Unable to resist the pull of self-preservation, he took off, flying toward the mountains as if nothing had happened.
Xu Xiao, observing his departure, smiled smugly, Whatever I want to do by the time I leave is beyond your control!
He then leisurely made his way back.
In the grand hall, Li Chengliao sat at the head of the room, holding a jade slip. A white-furred monkey stood nearby. The tall creature carried a staff on its back and wore a stern expression.
This white monkey, now at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, seldom spoke and rarely interacted with others. Its unwavering loyalty to the Li Family made it the perfect guardian for Li Chengliao.
Kneeling below him was Chen Mufeng, bowing his head in submission as he made his report.
"You are telling me Xu Xiao took two strikes from Old Man Liu and left wounded?" Li Chengliao said aloud as he listened carefully, pondering for a moment before his expression softened with a trace of guilt. "Seems I have been too harsh, envious of his talents… I may have wronged him."
Chen Mufeng remained silent, not daring to speak. Li Chengliao, known for his mild temperament, continued calmly, "Since that is the case, let us put this dispute with the Liu Family to rest. However… I fear Old Man Liu may pressure his daughter. Bring him here—I will explain the situation to him."
"Right away!" Chen Mufeng responded as he respectfully withdrew.
Li Chengliao sat in contemplation, considering how to smooth things over so he could return to his cultivation quickly.
"Xu Xiao may have potential, but he is not one to submit to others. It is best to foster goodwill, give him some Spirit Stones, and let him leave. My humble house cannot shelter a grand figure like him."
As these thoughts ran through his mind, an elderly figure shuffled into the hall, trembling as he kneeled before Li Chengliao. It was none other than Old Man Liu, who, despite his usual arrogance within the estate, now prostrated himself in silence.
"Liu Yi of the Liu Family pays respects to Family Head!"
He bowed deeply, his forehead damp with sweat, his voice trembling with respect.
"Family Head Liu, since your daughter Lingzhen and Xu Xiao have mutual affection, you should do them the favor of allowing their union. Let them pick a date, and I shall play the role of matchmaker on their wedding day!" Li Chengliao said as he stayed seated at the head of the hall and read from the jade slip in his hand, sipping tea calmly.
In his younger days, Old Man Liu had been a notorious wastrel, yet he had witnessed and heard of the Li Family's rise to power, leaving him deeply shaken. Due to Liu Rouxuan's connection, he had even met Li Tongya once.
At the time, he was still young and kneeled trembling before Li Tongya, too terrified to even raise his head. He could only hear Li Tongya addressing him by his full name and asking a few questions about the Liu Family's affairs, which had left his legs weak.
Now in his old age, Liu Yi had at least come to understand the gravity of situations and the value of life. However, with his fate in the hands of another, he could not find the words to speak.
Li Chengliao, noticing the silence, raised his eyebrows and glanced at him inquisitively.
"Hmm?"
That single sound shattered Liu Yi's courage. Torn between covering for Xu Xiao to save him and trembling with indecision, sweat streamed down his face. Before Li Chengliao could say a word, Liu Yi had already pressed his forehead to the ground repeatedly, sobbing uncontrollably.
Li Chengliao's smile slowly faded as he scrutinized the old man. Taking a step down from his seat, the crisp sound of his jade-tipped boots echoed on the steps below his robe.
He stood silently, watching as Liu Yi's sweat soaked the ground, realizing that something must be terribly wrong. In a low, heavy voice, he asked, "Liu Yi… what is going on?"
The mention of his name hit Liu Yi like a thunderclap, causing his legs to shake uncontrollably. Finally, the weight of the situation crushed him, and he wailed loudly, "Ancestor, Xu—"
He had only managed to utter the first syllable when the white monkey behind Li Chengliao opened its eyes, stepped forward, and reached for the old man.
But it was already too late. Black flames erupted from Liu Yi's body, bursting from his chest and abdomen with a thunderous boom. Blood splattered throughout the hall, sending his organs flying in all directions.
Black blood spouted like a fountain, filling the air. Li Chengliao stumbled back in shock, yet black stains still marred the hem of his robe, splattering across his chest and collar.
From within the boiling black blood, a dark seal shot upward, attempting to escape. However, a large furry hand swiftly reached out and deftly grasped the black light.
The black light struggled to break free, thrashing wildly amidst the overwhelming demonic energy surrounding it. Although it held a higher power, it was relentlessly ground down by the furry hand's immense force.
The white monkey withdrew its hand while Li Chengliao wiped the bloodstains from his collar. He removed his robe and draped it over his arm.
"Captain Chen!"
Li Chengliao's sudden shout rang through the hall. Hanging his robe carefully on the back of a chair, he saw Chen Mufeng rush in, his pupils dilating at the sight of the carnage.
Overwhelmed by fear, Chen Mufeng dropped to his knees with a thud, stammering, "I accept my punishment…"
