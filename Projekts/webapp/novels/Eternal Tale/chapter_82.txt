As the sun rises and sets and the stars move in their courses, days pass by gradually. Chen Xun and the big black ox are living a happier and happier life.
Sometimes the two senior brothers guarding the medicine garden would secretly envy them. They seem to have completely given up on pursuing higher cultivation levels...
What they do is truly bizarre in the eyes of the other disciples. They would soar into the sky with a big thing in their eyes, and soon after, joyful screams would echo from the heavens. They engage in activities like hunting and logging, bringing back several attractive large stones, leaving their junior brother and spirit beast delighted and babbling about something.
Perhaps in the world of cultivation, without the pursuit of higher realms, there are no worries.
Time passes, and as the years go by, it has been twenty years since Le Feng ascended to immortality. Chen Xun and the big black ox visit to offer incense and pay respects every year, and the sect has prepared a resting place for these disciples.
It is a mountain peak with countless tombstones of generations of disciples, called Xian Yin.
They have added their immortal points to defense and the essence of all things over the years, and life has become increasingly peaceful.
They never compete or offend anyone, and they are still quite amiable. It's hard to find a reason to trouble such people.
Their current immortal points are: Strength 21, Speed 21, Essence of All Things 22, Spiritual Energy 51, and Defense 50.
The collision between the Qian Nation and Wu Nation in the cultivation world suddenly comes to a halt, and it is said that they are preparing for something big.
However, both sides are equally powerful, unwilling to yield, and have started deploying formations at the border.
The Southern Dipper Mountain Secret Realm is officially closed, to be reopened in five hundred years. The prohibition on the extinction of medicinal herbs has been established long ago, and everyone understands.
But as soon as this news came out, cries of sorrow echoed among various sects. The news stimulated their fighting spirit.
With no cultivation resources, what should we do? Only by waging war against the Wu Nation! Some sects are even more eager for battle than the top ten sects; this is a golden opportunity to make a name for themselves.
Looking at the history of the cultivation world, the rise of every sect and the rise of every great cultivator is absolutely inseparable from the struggle for resources.
Even if your aptitude for cultivation is outstanding, as long as you are human, it is impossible to resist such temptations.
Who doesn't want to advance faster on the path of cultivation in the limited river of life? The path of cultivation has no end.
Chen Xun learned about these events during a meeting in the sect's conference hall. The sect leader even said that the cultivation worlds of the two nations will inevitably have a major war sooner or later; this enmity is not recent.
He also instructed the various foundation-building cultivators within the sect to prepare early, and everything is to follow the command of the top ten sects. In the event of a war between the two cultivation worlds, every major sect is duty-bound!
The news has finally been confirmed, and major sects have begun preparations. Some contribute manpower, and some contribute spirit stones. The entire Qian Nation's cultivation world is about to experience tremendous upheaval.
At that time, Chen Xun was holding a water cup made of wood, soaking precious medicinal herbs such as wolfberries, and adding two spiritual herbs for health.
Although this essence of all things seemed to have no adverse reactions to the body after rest, the psychological trauma was very significant.
Especially since they were cultivating medicinal herbs every day, health was a matter that could not be delayed. Wherever they went, they brought their drinks.
Chen Xun had learned medical skills from Ning Si for many years and couldn't afford to waste them. He even hung a small wooden barrel on the big black ox's head and made a long straw, so they could drink when they were thirsty.
The big black ox was happy for several days because of this and wrote on the ground that it felt its cultivation had improved.
But the effect was not to mention that, after drinking, their mental trauma was slowly healing, proving to be quite useful.
Chen Xun was listening attentively at the end of the gathering, occasionally sipping health tea. When he heard this news, his cup shook, and a look of shock flashed in his eyes.
The big black ox was squatting beside him at the time, and they exchanged a deep glance. The war for resources between the two nations is finally about to begin..."
"After the conclusion of the council meeting, Chen Xun and the big black ox hurriedly began preparations. If they could win, they would fight; if not, they needed to prepare an escape route.
But now, both nations were in a preparatory phase. The great war in the cultivation world wasn't something you could just declare and charge headlong into.
Wu Yuan Sect, Hui Quan Stream, and the Medicine Garden.
Chen Xun took out a map of the Qian Nation. It was brought back by Shi Jing, but his brows furrowed deeply.
The map unfolded in mid-air was quite large. Chen Xun and the big black ox stood diagonally across from each other, their eyes scanning various places on the map.
To the north of Qian Nation was Wu Nation, and to the south was an endless expanse of vast mountains. The map only noted the frequent appearances of great demons, with the other side marked as unknown.
To the east of Qian Nation, there were numerous kingdoms and large and small deserts, but none were as powerful as Qian Nation and Wu Nation.
To the west of Qian Nation was a lawless territory, with the vast and boundless Tian Duan Great Plains. Shi Jing mentioned that on the other side might be a superpowerful nation, even more powerful than the Qian Nation, several times.
"Old Ox, what do you think?" Chen Xun muttered, his gaze becoming profound. "Damn, this world is really vast."
"Moo?"
Old Black Ox was questioned. Every time it looked at this map, it felt a bit excited and nervous. Could they really travel to all these places in a lifetime?
"If we can't handle it when we get there, of course, we should prepare an escape route. We should not be reckless. Old Ox!" Chen Xun suddenly shouted with excitement in his eyes. "Tell me where we should run. Just point to one place. As long as we're together, anywhere is fine. Anywhere in the world can be our home."
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox suddenly ran over, placing its head on Chen Xun's body and constantly rubbing against him.
"Hahaha, damn, Old Ox, point quickly!" Chen Xun embraced the ox with both hands, his eyes continuously gleaming.
Both their hearts were beating continuously, and their gazes, blank and stunned, were fixed on the map. In such a vast and magnificent world, perhaps immortality is truly good and becomes more meaningful.
With a brother supporting each other, that feeling... ordinary people really can't comprehend.
"Moo!"
The big black ox stretched out its front hoof, pointing towards the west, then looked at Chen Xun.
In its mind, the north was definitely a no-go, and the south had dangerous great demons. There were too many kingdoms to the east, and Chen Xun had told them stories about constant warfare there.
Only the west remained. If there was a superpowerful nation at the end of the vast plains, the security would undoubtedly be stable, and everyone would reason with each other.
"Okay, Old Ox, if something goes wrong, we'll just head west. No one can stop us as long as we're together. Damn it, whoever tries to catch us will die! Hahaha!"
"Moo moo!"
The ox roared, rushing out, ready to pack up. When Chen Xun gave the order, they would flee directly.
But unexpectedly, Chen Xun shouted, "Old Ox, what are you doing?!"
"Moo?"
"It's not now; both nations in the cultivation world haven't started fighting yet. Why are you panicking? If we can't win, we'll run, but we have to fight when the time comes! Moo~"
The big black ox grinned. It got a bit too excited and forgot the current situation, quickly stopping its steps.
Chen Xun smiled and shook his head, continuing to focus on the map. There were many blank spaces, indicating the locations of various immortal sects.
These places had to be kept far away to avoid colliding with any dirty stuff and causing unnecessary trouble.
The rough map of the nine provinces of the Qian Nation was already in his mind. Although the details were few, he could roughly determine the directions.
Chen Xun carefully put away the map. He highly treasured anything given to him by others. Even a wooden carving represented someone's goodwill."
