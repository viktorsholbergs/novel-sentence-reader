Chen Xun finally understood why the system imposed these limits and why the number of points available for allocation increased with the advancement of his cultivation stage. The key was whether his body could endure the enhancements. He remembered the first time he allocated pointsâ€”he had ended up breaking his hand.
Limitless point allocation without corresponding cultivation advancement and control would be like playing with fire. He couldn't imagine the power of a single fireball spell back then. At one point, he almost burned off his underwear. This system had been protecting them all along without revealing its origins.
"Heh, damn, I've hit the jackpot," Chen Xun thought with a sly smile. No matter how it came about, having lived for a century already, everything else was a bonus.
"Moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, puzzled at his mischievous grin.
"Nothing, old ox, just thought of something great," Chen Xun said, winking at the big black ox. "Let's acquire the Five Elements cultivation methods and gather some information."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox responded joyfully, pressing against Chen Xun.
"Let's go!"
"Moo!"
In an instant, they dashed out of the formation. The ten Nascent Soul phantoms merged back into their bodies, continuing to absorb the essence of the Five Elements from the heavens and the earth.
Two hours later, in a lakeside pavilion near an ice lake.
Jin Yu seemed to have recovered significantly; her white hair gleamed brightly. She personally poured tea for Chen Xun and the big black ox. She knew from their previous meeting that they never drank tea offered by others, but she maintained her etiquette.
"Daoist Jin Yu, we have a favor to ask today," Chen Xun said, holding a bag of local specialties, untouched tea before him. "Would it be possible to assist us?"
Jin Yu looked deeply at them. They seemed more reserved, not at all like typical cultivators. Despite her own recovery, she felt she couldn't see through them any more, finding it strange.
"Hehe, Daoist Chen, feel free to ask," Jin Yu said kindly, understanding he must have been in seclusion to cultivate a new technique. "If you have any questions about the cultivation method, you may ask me."
"Actually, after cultivating this technique, I feel quite good," Chen Xun said, patting the big black ox beside him. "Right, old ox?"
"Moo?" The big black ox was confused, wondering why Chen Xun was dragging it into the conversation. "Moo!"
"Hehe, but I wish to research and create a new cultivation method..."
"Daoist Chen, forgive my bluntness, but creating a new method may no longer be feasible nowadays," Jin Yu advised, her eyes flashing with surprise. "Given the current resources of the cultivation world, there's no longer time for us Nascent Soul cultivators to squander. Today, even those with exceptional talent, with the support of sect elders, would take at least 500 to 600 years to reach the late stage of the Golden Core realm. Then, preparing for the Nascent Soul stage, refining their life-bound treasures, and other tasks would consume even more time," Jin Yu said, sighing deeply, understanding Chen Xun's intentions. "But Daoist Chen, this isn't ancient times. Back then, it was said some people could form their Nascent Souls in 300 years. That's why those sages had time to create new methods, study spells, and pass them down to us."
"Three hundred years?!" Chen Xun was astonished. Damn, that's inhuman. "Daoist Jin Yu, that's impossible. Even if they ate elixirs every day, they couldn't break through that fast."
"Moo moo!!"
The big black ox nodded frantically. It was shocking. They had spent over a thousand years forming their Nascent Souls. Without immortality, their graves would have been overgrown by now, and now someone was talking about forming a Nascent Soul in 300 years.
Using Big Brother's words, isn't this an outrageous fallacy?!
Jin Yu found their expressions amusing. She estimated their lifespans to be between seven hundred and a thousand years, which indeed made them quite young.
"Daoist Chen, you might not know this, but consuming too many pills is inadvisable. Don't rely on pills to break through."
"What do you mean by that, Daoist Jin Yu?" Chen Xun's eyes gleamed. He had many questions and finally had the chance to ask them. "From what I've seen, cultivators in this world rely on pills to break through and advance their cultivation."
The big black ox nodded thoughtfully, as that was indeed how they did things.
Jin Yu furrowed her brow slightly. Hearing such a question from a Nascent Soul cultivator was very odd, extremely odd. However, she still answered seriously.
"For example, if one uses a low-grade Foundation Establishment Pill to break through, their path will likely be halted at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage."
"Really?" Chen Xun raised an eyebrow. "Is it because of pill toxins or resistance?"
"Breaking through with such pills leaves toxins deep in the bones. As one advances, these toxins can become a significant hindrance. Cultivators with heavenly spiritual roots never rely on pills to break through." Jin Yu nodded gently, noticing the wide-eyed and slack-jawed ox beside her. She smiled subtly.
Chen Xun cursed inwardly, relieved he hadn't consumed those dark, murky Foundation Establishment Pills in the past. Otherwise, his cultivation journey would have been much more difficult.
"What about mid-grade Foundation Establishment Pills? Can they help break through to the Golden Core stage?" Chen Xun asked.
"It's challenging. Unless one uses mid-grade Five Elements Pills to force a breakthrough, their cultivation journey will likely end at the mid-Golden Core stage, making further progress nearly impossible."
"I see..." Chen Xun felt his mouth go dry.
He quickly took a sip of the herbal tea. No wonder the Five Elements Sect had said that at least mid-grade Five Elements Pills were needed to break through to the Golden Core stage. There were so many intricacies he hadn't known about.
The big black ox stood dumbfounded beside him, wondering what kind of pills Big Brother had been refining.
"However, mid-grade Essence Pills can also help with breakthroughs, as can heavenly treasures like Jade Source Fruits. Pill toxins accumulate in the body, making one prone to Qi deviation. Cultivation could regress instead of progress. Treasures like the Jade Source Fruit, nurtured by nature, aren't considered the same as pills," Jin Yu patiently explained, answering every question. "In ancient times, resources like the Jade Source Fruit were plentiful. Those sages made rapid progress because of them, but now it's no longer possible."
"Daoist Jin Yu, is it possible to refine pills without any pill toxins?" Chen Xun asked.
"Impossible, Daoist Chen. Even ancient alchemists couldn't achieve this, and no such legend has ever been passed down."
"Hehe, true, it was wishful thinking on my part," Chen Xun laughed heartily but felt a weight in his heart. He finally asked a long-held question, "Daoist Jin Yu, to be honest, I once read about a strange phenomenon in an ancient text."
"Oh? Please, Daoist Chen, do share," Jin Yu's interest was piqued.
"The text mentioned that certain pills had 'pill patterns.' What is the reason for this?" Chen Xun asked.
"Pill patterns?!" Jin Yu's eyes widened, her voice rising. "Those are supreme treasures beyond the highest grade of pills, surpassing even the intended effects of the pill itself."
"Daoist Jin Yu, could you explain a bit more? I'm quite interested in alchemy," Chen Xun asked, his demeanor now calm. With all the conditions in place, he was confident he could easily refine pills with pill patterns.
