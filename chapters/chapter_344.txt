Silence.
The only sounds left on Glacial Cloud Peak were the faint rustle of falling snowflakes and the drip-drop of rain. Cyan-white light flowed over the scene, filling everyone's eyes.
Yu Mugao was speechless, his face as white as paper.
The impact of the scene before him was overwhelming. The Yu Family's treasured legacy, the Foundation Establishment Realm artifact Jade Smoke Mountain, hovered in the air, returning to its original form, spinning quietly and harmlessly.
Yu Xiaogui had ceased his wailing, his eyes tightly shut, his face ashen.
Between Yu Mugao's trembling hands, mana glowed as he tried to mend the ghastly wound on his father's waist in futility. The sword wound was smooth and clean, and Yu Mugao, completely occupied in maintaining his father's life force, dared not lift his head.
In the sky, Li Tongya stood with his sword, his gaze sharp and silent. The Yu Family below remained muted in deadly silence. After a few breaths, the silence was broken by clear jingling sounds as the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators on the ground finally broke free from the sword light's hold, dropping their artifacts in panic. The mortals were even worse off, throwing down their weapons and kneeling, chaos erupting once more.
Li Tongya's gaze remained calm as he swallowed the blood rising to his throat, not daring to move. Though this strike had taken a toll on him, he stood still, dealing with the after-effects silently, refusing to show any signs of fatigue.
The suppressive force of the Jade Smoke Mountain roiled in his wrist while his qihai acupoint churned violently. His cultivation leaked away as if through a broken vessel, leaving his limbs stiff and immobile.
The mana from the Huashang Fruit clashed fiercely with his true essence, causing the Boundless Ocean within him to rage wildly. Blood welled up in his mouth several times, and his vision grew hazy, his chest tight and breathless.
Just then, light beams emerged from the depths of his Sea of Qi—a white orb glowing brilliantly, illuminating his entire qihai acupoint.
"The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed..."
The talisman seed's light suppressed the turmoil within his Sea of Qi, allowing Li Tongya a moment's respite. A glint of brilliance flashed in his eyes as he sheathed his sword.
Ching!
The clear sound of the sword being sheathed brought relief to the cultivators around him. They exchanged glances, realizing they were all drenched in cold sweat, their nerves on edge.
Li Tongya, with his flowing black hair and handsome features, seemed nonchalant, as if the strike had been effortless. Still holding his sword, he spoke politely and warmly, "Out of respect for Yuanwu Peak and Yu Muxian, I will overlook your transgressions."
His bright, clear eyes showed no hint of malice, but no one from the Yu Family dared to meet his gaze. Li Tongya repeated softly, "Please withdraw your forces."
Yu Mugao carefully lifted his unconscious father, his gaze sweeping over Li Tongya's wind-whipped white robe and the white-green sword light flashing in his mind. He ascended into the air slowly, stopping just before Li Tongya.
"Thank you for your mercy… Senior."
It seemed that Yu Mugao had come to terms with the shock now. Tears still streaked his face as he glanced at Li Tongya one last time before whispering, "Retreat!"
The Yu Family members, feeling as though they had been granted a reprieve, hurriedly followed him southward, not daring to look back. Cheers erupted on Glacial Cloud Peak as men and women embraced, weeping with joy.
Yu Mugao kept his eyes on his pale father until they were out of Fei Family's territory. Only then did Yu Xiaogui open his eyes, his voice hoarse as he said in a low voice, "This was your idea."
Yu Mugao looked at his weakened father, knowing his life was hanging by a thread and his cultivation path was likely severed. He lowered his head, silent.
Yu Xiaogui struggled to stand, shaking off his son's support. Yu Mugao sighed deeply, "Li Tongya likely had only one strike left, but I dared not gamble anymore!"
His figure was desolate and lonely, like a gambler who had lost everything. The Yu Family members nearby shivered at his words, exchanging glances and remaining silent.
"What a pity…"
Li Tongya's internal state was already in chaos, barely maintaining a balance. Fortunately, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed shone brightly, forcefully helping him sustain his present condition.
Holding his sword, Li Tongya slowly descended, watching the retreating figures of the Yu Family members as he murmured to himself, "Yu Mugao is a great threat to my family… It is a pity that I no longer have the strength to strike; otherwise, I would definitely kill him, even if it meant giving Yuanwu Peak and Yu Muxian an excuse to act against us."
He had run out of strength, barely clinging to life in his cave dwelling. Li Yuanjiao had reported the situation, and Li Tongya understood that he had no choice but to act.
"If I ignore the Fei Family, our Li Family will be next. Once Yu Mugao has no more scruples, combined with his cunning and ruthless methods, there will be even greater disasters…"
Li Tongya had left his cave, deliberately building up his aura and riding on a sea beast conjured from his mana, hoping to intimidate the Yu Family and avoid a confrontation.
Originally, the timing and setting were perfect. The natural phenomena stirred by his cultivation had already intimidated everyone, even Yu Xiaogui, who was frightened by his reputation for having slain a Maha.
But Yu Mugao's loud shout woke everyone up, prompting Yu Xiaogui to test the waters. Li Tongya's cultivation was powerful but once unleashed, it drained rapidly like a river bursting its banks.
Li Tongya continued to watch the Yu Family as they disappeared into the horizon, then finally shifted his gaze to the intricate patterns on the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation, admiring it silently.
The Yu Family fled in disarray, allowing the Fei Family to finally breathe a sigh of relief. However, when the man in the sky turned his gaze upon them, their anxiety returned, and they looked at each other in fear.
Fei Tongxiao was terrified, staring intently at the black-haired youth holding a cyan-white longsword in the sky. Although the Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation isolated the inside from the outside, he vaguely heard some words but still could not believe his eyes.
"Did the Yu Family say... this is Li Tongya?"
The youth's eyes were bright, his face handsome, his posture tall. The sword light from Li Tongya's weapon hurt Fei Tongxiao's eyes. He said with mixed emotions, "Who is he..?"
"Li Yuanyun?... No... Li Yuanyun has no spiritual orifice... This really is Li Tongya!"
Fei Tongyu had once seen Li Tongya from a distance at the Li Family. However, Li Tongya already sported a mature appearance when he had gained some fame, so now he could not recognize him at once, guessing to himself, "Perhaps Li Tongya gained some unknown benefits from slaying the Maha, causing his cultivation to soar and making him youthful again... This is not unprecedented in Jiangnan."
While the brothers were at a loss for words, Li Tongya gathered his mana and said warmly, "Li Tongya is here to pay respects; please open the formation!"
The two brothers were stunned, exchanged glances for a few moments, and both saw the apprehension in each other's eyes. The same doubt arose in their minds, and they spoke in unison.
"To open… Or not to open?"
