The Jade Court Guard hurried and left, and Chen Mufeng's expression was grim. Li Chengliao took a sip of tea and asked, "Battalion Commander… what happened?"
Chen Mufeng turned around and replied respectfully, "It's just a few trivial matters, Young Master... Let me—"
Li Chengliao happily poured him a cup of tea and responded, "There are no such things as trivial matters; they are all family affairs."
Chen Mufeng's expression shifted slightly, and he hurriedly explained, "It's about Lady Liu... She has a childhood sweetheart, the son of a family in town. His surname is Xu, and he has some family assets... His ancestor is the head of a town. The Liu Family wanted to use Lady Liu to elevate their status, but after hearing that Family Head is interested in her, they immediately changed their mind... and this caused some gossip..."
"Oh?"
An amused smile appeared on Li Chengliao's face, and he joked, "Looks like I've become a scoundrel who stole someone's wife!"
Chen Mufeng looked embarrassed and said, "We have sent two people to invite Lady Liu here but that man managed to beat them up and turn them away… Although those two are cultivators, they were no match for him."
At this, Li Chengliao's smile vanished instantly. He fixed his gaze on the middle-aged man and said, "In my Li Family's territory, I am the head of the second lineage. I sent people to bring her here, and he dared to beat them up and chase them away? Who does he take the Li Family for? We've never forced Lady Liu to agree to the marriage. She could have handled this in a more civilized manner instead of making things awkward!"
Chen Mufeng hung his head in silence and replied, "I have sent the Jade Court Guards over..."
"Wait…" Li Chengliao frowned and continued, "I finally made it down the mountain; let's not create a scene. My clan uncles dislike that and I don't want to risk drawing their attention. That won't end well."
Chen Mufeng nodded in agreement.
"Get two Jade Court Guards over here; I'll go there and see for myself," Li Chengliao instructed.
He straightened his brocade robe and walked toward the door, accompanied by Chen Mufeng.
"This young master from the Xu Family is also rather peculiar. He was mute and had been stuck at the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for many years. He only broke through last month and now that he can speak, everyone showers him with praises…"
Liu Family's courtyard.
Although the Liu Family had been in decline for many years, it once enjoyed a glorious past.
The courtyard was dark and old, but it occupied a large area. An exquisite stone table sat in the center, where a woman with a cold aura around her leaned against it.
Her beautiful face was filled with radiance, but her slightly furrowed brow revealed a trace of sadness. At the other end of the table stood a strong, handsome young man who radiated vitality.
"Xiao, you are acting too impulsively... The Li Family is powerful and well-established; the geniuses in their family are cultivating in the sect, and they are connected to immortal clans through marriage. How could you offend them like this..? Even if they came to my house, I could have just found an excuse to deal with them. By beating those two up and chasing them away, you're essentially making this into a big issue!"
Xu Xiao crossed his arms and shook his head as he sneered coldly.
"You don't understand! How many times will your excuses work? As long as their eldest son is interested in you, he'll continue sending people to bother you. The Liu Family won't miss the chance to climb the social ladder either. The only way to make him back down is to create a scene!"
"The Li Family values their reputation and enforces strict rules within their clan. My only concern is that we won't be able to create a big enough problem!" he added.
Liu Lingzhen shook her head and remarked softly. "You've been holed up in the courtyard for years and was mute before. You don't understand the extent of the Li Family's influence..."
Xu Xiao laughed proudly and assured, "Don't worry! I've broken through to Qi Cultivation Realm! The great Dao is just right in front of me!"
"What?!"
Surprise and joy filled Liu Lingzhen's face as she continued, "It's only been a few years! You've made another breakthrough?!"
She paused, then added with a hint of regret, "It's a pity it came two years too late. You're already twenty-five, and the Xu Family has bestowed the spiritual qi of heaven and earth on your big brother..."
"It doesn't matter. I don't even want that! It's just a portion of Cave Spring Clear Qi. I've used better," Xu Xiao replied, raising his eyebrows with disdain.
"It's just that I've been breaking through too quickly, so I can't reveal it to others yet. Though there's a secret technique to conceal it, it's hard to guarantee that the Li Family won't have any perception technique to see through it. I'll have to wait a few more years..."
He then changed the subject and continued coldly, "I'm just waiting for that pack of dogs to come and openly confront me. Even if he is Li Chengliao, the eldest son of this generation, the people in the Clan Affairs Courtyard are watching him closely… He'll be in trouble if they report him directly to Qingdu!"
After hearing him, Liu Lingzhen calmed down significantly and murmured, "What if the Clan Affairs Courtyard covers up for him…?"
"Hahaha! I checked the records a few days ago. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has always targeted the powerful. If they made any mistake, they would be the first to be blamed," Xu Xiao replied confidently.
He chuckled coldly and continued, "As long as you and I stay calm, the Jade Court Guards can't do anything to us! And with the immortal sect watching over all of us, I'm sure we'll be fine!"
Liu Lingzhen nodded, somewhat naively, listening to the words of her beloved. Just then, Xu Xiao detected something with his spiritual sense and whispered, "Someone is coming!"
Sure enough, an elder from the Liu Family called out from outside obsequiously. A series of knocks came from the courtyard door, followed by a creaking sound.
Madam Liu's voice rang out, "Zhen'er! Open the door quickly!"
Liu Lingzhen's face paled, and she grabbed Xu Xiao and urged him to leave. However, Xu Xiao refused to move and merely said, "It's too late. I doubt he can see through my cultivation. Just let him in!"
Madam Liu had no intention of waiting for Liu Lingzhen to answer the door. With a creak, it was pushed open. However, it was a young man clad in a pale-colored dharma robe who entered first with a spear slung across his back.
He glanced at the two of them and waved casually.
The middle-aged man behind him, who was at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, pushed the group of elders and clan uncles from the Liu Family out with ease. The door quickly slammed shut behind them.
The young man with a heroic face then said, "Li Chengliao from the Li Family greets fellow Daoists."
Liu Lingzhen felt as if she had fallen into an ice cave, and Xu Xiao was momentarily stunned. He had never expected Li Chengliao to come in person.
"Xu Xiao from the Xu Family greets Young Master," he managed to reply.
Seeing the way the couple looked at each other, Li Chengliao quickly understood the situation. He continued, speaking with a smile, "Young Master Xu truly looks impressive. The Xu Family is a well-respected lineage; it's about time a hero emerged among them."
Li Chengliao's words caught Xu Xiao off guard and rendered him speechless, while Liu Lingzhen found herself in a difficult position.
After a brief pause, Li Chengliao clarified, "It was the Liu Family who gave your name earlier, my lady. What a foolish mistake they have made! My subordinate also took their bribes and came to invite you over. Thankfully, Young Master Xu intervened; otherwise, it would have caused a misunderstanding!"
"This is certainly my office's oversight. As an apology, I've reserved a quota on the peak for the Xu Family and you, my lady. I've also sent someone to your family to issue a formal apology. I hope you can forgive the incompetence of my subordinates," he added generously.
