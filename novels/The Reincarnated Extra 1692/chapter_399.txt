(Flower Shop) Reminiscing on the Day Before the ‘Dawn’ 2
* * *
There is a small hill called Mihabyushira Hill, located on the outskirts of the Ashgo Kingdom’s royal capital.
It’s a hill with a good view, where you can see the entire cityscape of the royal capital, including the royal castle.
Mihabyushira Hill, because of its magnificent view, was once loved by the citizens of the royal capital as a place of relaxation.
…However, that’s a story of the past.
It’s now completely overgrown with weeds, with only animal trails remaining.
But…
On this day, two people, a man and a woman, met on the meadow atop this hill.
The woman is a beautiful woman with long reddish-brown hair tied back, dressed plainly.
She’s an informant called ‘Flower Shop’, and a member of the underground organization resisting the current king, the tyrant Nidero.
Her partner is a slender, yet muscular man, covered in scars.
This man is known as ‘the Grim Reaper’… an assassin hired by Flower Shop and the others.
As befits his profession as an assassin, he constantly exudes a dangerous aura, and furthermore, he has black hair and black eyes, a combination despised in this world.
Therefore, even among the members of the underground organization, his employers, many fear the Grim Reaper and avoid contact with him.
But for some reason, only Flower Shop could converse normally with the Grim Reaper, so exchanging information with him had become exclusively her job.
“Hey.”
Now.
Flower Shop, sitting by the stone pillar standing on the meadow, called out to the Grim Reaper, who was standing, glaring at the royal castle.
She has already delivered her message.
That ‘it’s the Grim Reaper who will decide when “Dawn Day” begins’.
So this is a private conversation.
“After this job is over… why don’t we… meet again here…?”
“…………”
The Grim Reaper didn’t answer.
He didn’t even turn around.
He just stared… stared… at the royal castle.
“Look… we’ll need… a final debriefing or something, right? So…”
“I’ve already received… a sufficient sum… in advance.”
The Grim Reaper curtly said to Flower Shop, who was fumbling for words.
“So, once the job is done, I’m leaving. I won’t be seeing you again.”
“Huh? Hahaha, come on…”
Flower Shop chuckled at the Grim Reaper’s blunt attitude, but pressed on.
“Even so, there’ll be things to discuss, right? Like a wrap party.”
“Unnecessary.”
““…………””
The conversation stalled.
Flower Shop sighed secretly, but it was drowned out by the autumn wind.
Silence continued for a while.
“…Don’t get… too involved… with someone like me.”
And surprisingly, it was the Grim Reaper who broke the silence.
“Don’t associate… with a Cursed Child. It’s… the color of misfortune.”
He coldly declared.
“No!”
Flower Shop couldn’t help but shout.
The Grim Reaper, seemingly surprised, glanced at Flower Shop.
“That’s… that’s not the color of misfortune… It’s the color of a hero!!”
“What are you…”
“From now on! I’ll! Make it that way! I’m telling you!”
Flower Shop, realizing that she was shouting, blushed and looked down.
But she immediately raised her head, looking straight at the Grim Reaper, and…
“I’ll… create a place… for you…”
…She squeezed out those words.
“…………”
The Grim Reaper was silent.
His eyes were still cold and intimidating.
But… he slowly approached Flower Shop.
And then… he ruffled her hair forcefully.
“…!?”
This was the first time something like this had happened to her.
Flower Shop blushed even more, flustered by the sudden action, and just let it happen.
His grip was strong, and she was embarrassed, so she couldn’t lift her head, which was being pushed down from above.
Therefore, she couldn’t see what kind of expression the Grim Reaper had.
But…
“…Thank you. I’m glad.”
Those whispered words were definitely the warmest she had ever heard him speak.
And then…
“But… that’s why…”
And his next words were…
“Forget me… someone like me.”
They were definitely the saddest she had ever heard him speak.
“I… I won’t forget you!”
When she regained her composure, raised her head, and shouted… the Grim Reaper had already turned his back on her and started descending the hill.
“I’ll never… never, ever… forget you…!”
Her vision blurred.
Tears streamed down Flower Shop’s cheeks.
“So you too… don’t forget… me…!”
Her thoughts were gradually drowned out by sobs, and finally, her words became incoherent.
After watching the Grim Reaper disappear into the forest, his presence vanishing…
…Flower Shop crouched down and sobbed.
And then, clasping her hands together, she desperately…
…Prayed for the safety… of the Grim Reaper, who’s heading to battle.
This concludes Arc 17, and Part 1.
Thank you for reading.
It would have been better to have one more chapter, so I might add a side story later, but that’s a bonus.
As for the main story, this is the end.
Thank you very much for finding this amateur novel, which is only impressive in its length, and for reading it this far.
I was able to write this novel thanks to your support.
It might sound cliché, but it’s really true.
Thank you very, very, very, very much.
‘The Reincarnated Extra’ will continue, so I hope you’ll continue to read it.
Thank you.
Now, for the …
…Before we begin Part 2…
…I’ll post Arc 18, an interlude, so to speak.
It’ll be a short adventure that takes place before Emi travels to a new stage for her adventures… and a few stories about various people.
I hope you’ll enjoy it!
See you later!
