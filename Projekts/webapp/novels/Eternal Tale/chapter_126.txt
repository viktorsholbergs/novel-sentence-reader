However, others didn't charge many extra spirit stone fees, which made Chen Xun feel much better.
He and the big black ox continued to focus their gaze on the auction platform. The second item up for auction was a magical instrument, which finally sold for a high price of thirty-five thousand spirit stones.
Watching this, cold sweat dripped down their foreheads once again.
And the items that followed became more and more outrageous: magical instruments, millennium spirit medicines, medium-grade elixirs, celestial treasures, and spiritual beasts, everything one could imagine.
These were all rare items that ordinary shops didn't sell, but they didn't have what they needed, so they could only watch eagerly.
Moreover, the prices of these items were getting higher one after another, already surpassing fifty thousand low-grade spirit stones.
Chen Xun quickly took notes, taking out a small notebook to continuously record the names of the items, roughly sketching some drawings, and writing down their approximate prices.
Truly eye-opening, incredibly so!
The big black ox was also beside him, anxiously mooing and constantly adding details, its heart pounding rapidly.
However, the event lasted for a year, with three auctions, each spaced four months apart. The two spirit medicines they lacked would definitely appear during this period, so they weren't worried at all.
On the auction platform, the old man's face was slightly flushed, and beside him was a huge cage:
"The Azure Creek Flame-mouthed Bird spiritual beast cub has already been bid up to ninety thousand spirit stones by a fellow daoist! If nurtured properly, it will be a great help in the later stages of Foundation Establishment." The old man began to speak non-stop, his eyes no longer calm. "If one encounters some great opportunity, breaking through to the Golden Core stage is not impossible."
"A fellow daoist has bid ninety-five thousand spirit stones."
"One hundred thousand spirit stones, what keen eyes!"
Although there was only one person on the auction platform, the atmosphere was still heated. If there were no room partitions, one couldn't imagine how noisy the entire hall would be.
In a certain room, loud shouts kept coming:
"Damn, Old Ox, do these people have spirit stone mines at home?!"
"Moo moo!"
"I can't believe it. This auction has been going on for a whole day, and it's only just begun. They're already starting at a hundred thousand." Chen Xun's water cup trembled, he took a sip unsteadily, feeling unusually hot.
The big black ox's head also leaned weakly against Chen Xun's body, its eyes quite bewildered.
It was convinced that these people definitely had dug up spirit stone mines and weren't lacking in spirit stones at all. They could buy whatever they wanted.
"Old Ox, I have a plan for the future." Chen Xun's chest rose and fell unevenly, his eyes sharp, "If we ever encounter ownerless spirit stone mines in the future, damn it, we'll dig! We'll dig fiercely!"
"Moo!" The big black ox roared angrily, suddenly filled with strength all over its body, rising abruptly, it must dig!
Chen Xun snorted coldly, his eyes filling with confidence again: "We must become the tycoons of the cultivation world. Even if we buy Red Electric Wolves, we have to buy two."
"Moo?" The big black ox was puzzled. One would be enough to eat.
"Buy one, throw one away. Otherwise, other cultivators will think that we, as big tycoons, can't afford it?!"
"Moo~~~" The big black ox felt comforted, its tail raised high in the air, and the big brother's words made sense.
"Old Ox, keep watching; stay calm. What's my identity? What's your position as the big black ox?!"
"Moo moo!"
The ox's eyes were excited. It never doubted Chen Xun. We are the tycoons of the cultivation world, now it's just a small deal of a mere hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones.
Chen Xun chuckled, his demeanor calm in every movement. Taking another sip of health tea, it wasn't so hot anymore.
On the auction platform, a sky-blue alchemy furnace was placed. It was quite large, but it seemed to have been used for a long time, emitting a scent of ancestral heritage...
"This item is offered by a certain sect, called the 'Northern Cold Radiance Furnace'. I believe you can all tell that it is an alchemy furnace." The old man paused here, leaving a suspense. "After appraisal, this furnace may have been a low-grade Earth-tier alchemy furnace! But..."
In the room, Chen Xun was already on edge, his heart in his throat. He actually needed an alchemy furnace; his pill refinement success rate was too low, which was greatly related to his yellow-tier alchemy furnace.
The big black ox was also nervously watching the auction platform. Chen Xun had mentioned it several times; he wanted to exchange it for a new furnace.
But all the major shops sell only low-grade black-tier ones, not only expensive but also of quite ordinary quality. Unless you pay out of pocket for the materials and customize one at a refinery in the city.
Chen Xun and the big black ox's gazes were fixed firmly on the auction platform.
The old man smiled slightly: "This furnace seems to have suffered some damage due to its age and appears to have been affected by a major battle. Its grade has dropped to the middle-grade black-tier. However, it still retains some characteristics of an Earth-tier artifact, such as amplifying alchemy flames and making it more compatible with spiritual manipulation." He paused here and looked at the Northern Cold Radiance Furnace, "I believe fellow daoists are also curious as to why such a treasure is being auctioned off, and whether there might be anything improper about it."
In the room, Chen Xun and the big black ox nodded frantically, their hearts deeply touched. It was evident that this was an heirloom.
The old man's gaze was solemn as he spoke word by word: "Actually, the sect that sent it for auction did not specify the reason, but with the backing of the Top Ten Sects of Qian Nation, the auctioned item is absolutely without issue and does not hide any restrictions or dangers."
The cultivators in the various rooms of the Taigu Hall all had a change in expression.
"Starting bid: thirty thousand low-grade spirit stones."
"Thirty-one thousand."
"A fellow daoist has bid forty thousand. Although this item is damaged, it is still incomparable to an ordinary middle-grade black-tier alchemy furnace."
"Fifty thousand spirit stones! A fellow daoist has bid fifty thousand. I believe many fellow daoists have already been attracted by the characteristics of this item."
In the room, Chen Xun's gaze was steady as he looked at the big black ox, "Old Ox, how many spirit stones do we have left?"
"Moo~" The big black ox cast a water spirit spell on the ground and wrote: One hundred and forty-three thousand one hundred and fifty-two low-grade spirit stones.
"Old Ox, I want to buy this."
"Moo!"
The big black ox had no objections whatsoever, nodding vigorously. Only it knew how difficult pill refinement was for Chen Xun; most of his numerous notebooks were filled with failed alchemy experiences.
Chen Xun chuckled and also nodded towards the ox.
On the auction platform, the price continued to soar, already reaching ninety thousand low-grade spirit stones.
Even in the city's refineries, even if it was customized privately, a middle-grade black-tier alchemy furnace couldn't reach such an exorbitant price.
"Old Ox, let's scare them with a direct bid of one hundred thousand."
"Moo~" The big black ox responded, and spiritual energy surged within its body, sending a beam of light upward.
On the auction platform, the old man was slightly excited: "One hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones! It seems that fellow daoists also have intentions to collect this furnace. But in my humble opinion, this item is indeed worthy."
"Damn, you're really good at raising the price. Is this auction your family's business..." Chen Xun cursed inwardly, quietly clenching his fists. This auctioneer was a bit too professional; he had to be dealt with!
"Moo~" The big black ox started bidding again, its eyes wide open, without any hesitation, even if it used up all the spirit stones, it had to buy them.
"One hundred and twenty-five thousand spirit stones. Does any fellow daoist want to bid higher?" The old man's face was flushed, just the commission from this auction would be enough for him to have resources for decades in cultivation.
Such opportunities were envied by countless cultivators around him, but who told him he had the skill that even if he reached the Golden Core stage, he could still keep a straight face.
The major cultivators in the various rooms frowned slightly. This kind of furnace didn't offer much improvement in cultivation and strength; it was only useful for alchemists, and it was damaged...
Although it was once an Earth-tier low-grade item, they didn't know how much rare material it would take to repair it. It was like an endless pit.
The price of the middle-grade black-tier had already exceeded their expectations, and they had no intention of bidding further.
Bang!
With a final strike of the gavel, the Northern Cold Radiance Furnace was successfully auctioned off by a certain senior cultivator.
In the room,
"Old Ox! Well done!!"
"Moo moo!!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox hugged each other in excitement, shouting with joy, taking another small step on the path of cultivation.
After a while, a person from outside the room collected the spirit stones and handed them a large storage bag containing the furnace.
This made Chen Xun and the big black ox extremely happy. Freeloading a storage bag seemed like the hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones weren't spent in vain. The Top Ten Sects were really considerate.
