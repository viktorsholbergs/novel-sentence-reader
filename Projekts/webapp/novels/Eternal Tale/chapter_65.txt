These five main peaks of the Five Elements Sect, their alchemy hall, are the most disordered of all. The senior elders do as they please.
Not only because the alchemy hall holds a high position in the Five Elements Sect and is highly regarded, but also because there is an unruly peak master. It could be said that the top is not straight, so the bottom is crooked.
As the vice peak master, Zuo Yiying also put a lot of effort into the alchemy hall.
"Senior Sister Zuo." The people's expressions turned serious, and they quickly paid their respects, as if they were afraid of this person.
Chen Xun also bowed his head and respectfully saluted, secretly swallowing his saliva. As a vice peak master, she was at least a late-stage Foundation Building cultivator, but she was incredibly young and had a commanding presence.
"Chen Xun, come with me." Zuo Yiying, graceful with long hair down to her waist, walked towards a side hall while carrying herself with confidence.
"Senior Brothers and Sisters, I'll be going now." Chen Xun led the big black ox and bid farewell to the senior elders.
"Safe travels, Junior Brother Chen Xun."
"Actually, Senior Sister Zuo is not a bad person. Don't worry too much, Junior Brother Chen Xun."
"Junior Brother Chen Xun, go with peace of mind. If it's not convenient, we can also take care of this black ox spiritual beast."
...
The senior elders earnestly spoke one after another, and Chen Xun felt increasingly uneasy as he walked away, constantly glancing back at their expressions. What did they mean?
In the side hall, Zuo Yiying sat in the main seat, her eyes focused and fixed on Chen Xun.
Chen Xun tried to smile, sometimes raising his head and sometimes lowering it. This woman was playing mind games with me, it seemed.
The big black ox, however, showed no fear and gazed appreciatively at the layout of the side hall.
"Chen Xun, a native of Yongquan Prefecture in the Qian Dynasty, failed in the Ascension Great Competition at Nine Star Valley and joined the Five Elements Sect. He diligently cultivated spirit fields and also participated in the sect's major competitions."
Zuo Yiying spoke slowly, never taking her eyes off of Chen Xun. "Twenty years ago, you entered the South Dip Mountain and obtained three Foundation-Building spirit herbs for the sect. Afterward, you quietly cultivated spirit fields..."
Chen Xun felt a bit dry in the throat after listening. Most of their experiences were true, but they had also done many other things, such as going for rides, hunting, reading, and catching mountain chickens. It wasn't as dull as she portrayed it.
"Your background is clean, and there don't seem to be any issues."
Zuo Yiying said it self-contentedly, as if she were very satisfied with Chen Xun. "It seems you have a great liking for cultivating spirit herbs."
"Senior Sister Zuo, to be honest, both I and my big black ox are skilled at cultivating spirit herbs. We really enjoy it!"
"Moo moo~~"
Both Chen Xun and the black ox seemed to become more enthusiastic, discussing something that struck a chord.
Zuo Yiying smiled slightly. "Have you made progress with the Water Spirit Technique?"
"I've reached the second level! I actually have no interest in fighting. Besides cultivation, my main focus is practicing the Water Spirit Technique."
Stepping forward, Chen Xun formed hand seals, and in mid-air, bubbles filled with a faint spiritual energy emerged, floating there.
Zuo Yiying stood up solemnly. It was indeed the second level of the Water Spirit Technique. The sect was in dire need of such talents, and this was her real purpose for personally receiving Chen Xun into the sect.
Every Foundation Building senior elder sought to break through and achieve immortality. They couldn't afford to spend a lot of time practicing the Water Spirit Technique. The cultivation and search for resources had consumed most of their lives, and there was only a dozen or so people within the sect who had reached the second level of the Water Spirit Technique.
The precious spirit herbs of the Five Elements Sect were mainly maintained by them. Most of them had abandoned their own paths and willingly offered themselves to the Five Elements Sect.
They had also captured Foundation Building stage rogue cultivators and forced them to practice the Water Spirit Technique, but none of them had succeeded. This little technique seemed to temper the heart and required extraordinary patience. The cultivation period was exceptionally long, and it was extremely demanding.
"Do you know if there are people who have reached the third level of the Water Spirit Technique in the top ten immortal sects?" Zuo Yiying suddenly changed the topic.
"Such an extraordinary individual actually exists? I've already spent most of my life trying to reach the second level, and now progress has slowed down, approaching stagnation."
Chen Xun was greatly surprised, furrowing his brows, and asked, "Regarding this third level, Senior Sister Zuo, can it really be cultivated?"
"Of course, the power of the third level of the Water Spirit Technique can nurture countless rare spiritual herbs, enabling them to survive in harsh conditions. Even Foundation-Building stage spiritual herbs are included."
Zuo Yiying nodded solemnly and said, "If someone from our Five Elements Sect can cultivate the third level of the Water Spirit Technique, we will use the full strength of the sect, countless elixirs, and precious materials to help them reach the Golden Core stage."
These words had an inexplicable implication, and Chen Xun's heart trembled. It was a good thing he hadn't mentioned that he had already reached the third level, or that not only the sect's attention but also the possibility of assassinations from other sects might have been in play.
"No, this is too ostentatious and dangerous. It's better to cultivate spiritual herbs honestly," Chen Xun thought, putting aside any other thoughts.
"Senior Sister Zuo, I will devote all my efforts to cultivating the Water Spirit Technique. I don't have many hobbies, but I really enjoy cultivating spiritual herbs."
Chen Xun spoke sincerely, "Although I'm not particularly skilled in combat, I'm willing to contribute to the sect."
Zuo Yiying nodded slightly and felt a bit hopeful, hoping he wouldn't be led astray by the temptation of a longer lifespan, as having a five-element mixed spiritual root made it impossible to break through to the Golden Core stage.
"Chen Xun, my Junior Brother," Zuo Yiying's tone softened.
"Please speak, Senior Sister." Chen Xun instinctively took a step back.
Zuo Yiying smiled brightly and said softly, "Although it's difficult for those with five-element spiritual roots to reach the Golden Core stage, you still have over three hundred years of life, and you can accomplish many meaningful things."
"Of course, Junior Brother naturally understands," Chen Xun's heart sank, but he still responded with a smile.
The big black ox, on the other hand, felt slightly irritated. Wasn't this woman supposed to be encouraging them to work honestly for the sect?
In reality, they understood the situation. It was just that this woman was being overly clever and not leaving them any dignity. She had said that she would cultivate spiritual herbs properly, and then she added more conditions.
Zuo Yiying nodded and, in an instant, changed her expression. She took out a set of clothing from her storage bag and floated it in front of Chen Xun, saying, "The position of a senior elder requires at least the mid-stage of the Foundation Building realm. However, since you have been admitted to the Alchemy Hall, you should no longer wear the attire of an outer disciple."
"Yes, Senior Sister," Chen Xun bowed, and he noticed that the senior elders were wearing cyan-gray robes that exuded a sense of stability.
Zuo Yiying took out a cyan-gray token from her storage bag, infused it with spiritual power, and looked at Chen Xun. "Junior Brother Chen, offer a drop of your blood."
Chen Xun's eyes narrowed, and he didn't hesitate. He forced out a drop of his blood from his body and sent it flying into the air.
The cyan-gray token floated in mid-air and instantly absorbed Chen Xun's blood, emitting a cyan light. It seemed to acknowledge its master and flew directly towards Chen Xun, landing in his hand.
"This token is a prohibition token of the Fuguang Xuanpin Grand Array. It allows you to enter the sect's real spiritual herb garden. I won't go into too much detail about the rules."
With grace, Zuo Yiying sat down slowly. "People who practice the Water Spirit Technique to the second level are calm and undisturbed. If there are no urgent matters, the sect won't disturb them, and their freedom won't be restricted."
"But," Zuo Yiying hadn't finished her sentence.
Chen Xun was about to express his joy and gratitude when a cold voice interrupted, dousing his excitement like a bucket of cold water.
"The sect's spiritual herb garden is a matter of great importance. If, within a hundred years, someone is absent for twenty years, it will be considered desertion, and anyone from the Five Elements Sect who encounters them will be executed."
Zuo Yiying raised her head slightly, looking down at Chen Xun. "Although it sounds harsh, every nation has its laws, and every sect has its rules. It's not targeted at you, Junior Brother Chen."
With the Fuguang Xuanpin Grand Array overseeing the spiritual herb garden, it had an inherent detecting function; even Golden Core stage cultivators couldn't secretly take away a spiritual herb seed without being noticed. This was one of the secrets of the Five Elements Sect.
