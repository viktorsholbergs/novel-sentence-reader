Li Qingxiao pulled Xiao Xian into the carriage, and then finally let go of his hand. She slumped into the seat, her small face showing signs of discomfort as she muttered quietly to herself.
Xiao Xian, his palms still sweaty from being held all the way to the carriage, asked awkwardly, "What else do I need to do?"
"My mother said we just need to return on this carriage," Li Qingxiao replied with a frown. The bumpy ride had made her feel unwell, so she lay down and endured it silently with her lips pressed tightly together.
Xiao Xian could only sit next to her quietly as well, leaning against the carriage wall. After having been up since early in the morning and kept busy for hours, he felt hungry. He reached for the pastries he had brought, but to his dismay, found that they had been crushed and scattered during the commotion. Sighing, the boy leaned back and closed his eyes, soon drifting asleep.
When he awoke, it was dusk. Xiao Xian noticed that Li Qingxiao seemed much better now, and was peering out the window. Seeing him awake, she nudged him and said in a childish voice, "My name is Li Qingxiao."
"I am Xiao Xian from Mount Yu," Xiao Xian replied. The girl nodded and lay back down as the boy's face twisted in discomfort from his hunger.
"Lady... do you have anything to eat?" he asked shyly, a flush creeping up his neck.
Li Qingxiao was momentarily stunned but then nodded. She retrieved a wooden box from under the carriage seat and handed it to Xiao Xian. He gratefully took it, unfastened the wooden latch, and opened the lid to find neatly arranged pastries. All of them bore small red flower marks on them, making them look extra appetizing.
Xiao Xian, feeling famished, quickly ate three pieces, savoring their fragrant sweetness. "Delicious!" he mumbled in sheer delight.
He continued to eat, but after three more pieces, the lid of the box snapped shut. Li Qingxiao's small, fair hand rested on the box, her brow furrowed. She said in a childish voice, "The road to Mount Lijing will get bumpier. If you eat too much now, you might throw up later. There are still several hours to go, so save some."
Since it was someone else's food, Xiao Xian could only nod obediently. Li Qingxiao giggled and then asked in a low voice, "I heard that our families are related by marriage… Brother Xian, tell me, do you have any good brothers in the Xiao Family? I would like to hear about them."
Xiao Xian looked at her, feeling a strange stir in his heart. "Brother Guitu is the oldest in my generation. He is exceptional in everything... and condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra at just eight years old," he replied thoughtfully.
Li Qingxiao's expression darkened slightly as she responded, "My cultivation is very slow… I have not even condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra yet."
Xiao Xian, whose talent was also not exceptional, felt a sense of camaraderie. He sighed as he said, "I am the same. All the elders focus on those born prodigies... everyone wants to be a genius. They were just lucky! Life is really unfair... Doesn't help the fact that I'm dumb. Unlike my older brothers who can get things right on their first try, I need to hear the same instructions twice, sometimes even three times, only to barely understand them."
After he finished, Li Qingxiao simply snorted and said, "We are born into prestigious clans, with many people below us. How can we possibly complain about unfairness? Likewise, I was born to marry into your Xiao Family; there's nothing I can do about it either."
Xiao Xian was momentarily stunned before he laughed awkwardly, scratching his head. After this exchange, the two began chatting, discussing everything from sword immortals to the Purple Mansion Realm, and from the Purple Mansion Realm to Wu and Yue States.
Xiao Xian grew more familiar with Li Qingxiao, calling her "little sister" at every turn which made her laugh joyously.
As the mountain road became increasingly bumpy, Li Qingxiao fell silent from discomfort, and Xiao Xian had nothing more to say. They both endured the ride quietly, both eventually falling into a deep sleep.
Half-asleep, Xiao Xian found himself holding Li Qingxiao who was swaying back and forth with the carriage. He could not help but grumble, "Your Li Family really doesn't know how to enjoy a good life… I don't expect having fabric cushion on this carriage to block the summer heat, but how is there not even a formation to absorb the shocks? We are supposed to be cultivators, yet we are being tossed around like mortals…"
Li Qingxiao cleared her throat and replied through gritted teeth, "Our family does not go for that sort of thing. Seeking comfort is considered a crime and will get you dragged to the Clan Affairs Courtyard for a whipping!"
Xiao Xian was taken aback and simply responded, "Being born into your family is truly unfortunate…"
"Hmph!" Li Qingxiao snorted, and they both fell silent. After about two hours, Xiao Xian, still drowsy, felt his palm grow warm. Li Qingxiao had laid her head on his hand. Before he could react, he felt a sudden wetness on his palms—she had vomited… on him.
"Damn it…" Xiao Xian swore groggily, opening his eyes to see Li Qingxiao's face heavily flushed as she tried to clean up hastily.
He looked at her and teased, "How old are you to still be drinking milk?"
"Shut up!" Li Qingxiao grumbled, though her voice was as soft as a mosquito's buzz.
The carriage moved leisurely along the path. Li Yuanjiao, unaware of the discomfort Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian were experiencing inside, rode his horse beside Xiao Guiluan's bridal sedan.
Glancing at the woman inside, he asked softly, "Are you familiar with the situation within my family, my dear?"
"I know a bit about it," Xiao Guiluan, conversing with her husband for the very first time, answered earnestly. She continued, "I have just one question for you, dear husband."
Li Yuanjiao, catching a glimpse of sharp, intelligent eyes, felt a slight stir in his heart as he replied, "What is it?"
"Do you have any intentions of vying for the position of the family head?" Xiao Guiluan asked.
Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly, his left hand tugging at the reins in irritation as replied, "I have no such intentions."
Xiao Guiluan paused for a moment before simply saying, "I see."
Li Yuanjiao replayed the earlier rituals at the Xiao Residence in his mind and caught on to many subtle details. He then asked gently, "Why wasn't your father present?"
He was naturally asking why Xiao Guiluan's father was not there to see her off. This caused her to pause again before she answered finally, "My father and I have no affection for each other. He resents that I did not marry locally and bring a son-in-law into the family, but instead, sought connections through marriage in the west. In his fury, he refused to see me off."
Li Yuanjiao was secretly pleased by this news. Nodding, he smiled as he continued testing the waters, saying, "What a fool."
Xiao Guiluan chuckled softly and replied without hesitation, "He is indeed… a fool."
Then, in a gentle tone, she added, "Only my older brothers care for me. With this marriage, I have severed ties with my family. If anything happens in the future, I fear I will not be able to seek their help."
Li Yuanjiao understood her clearly.
As long as Xiao Yuansi was alive, with the connection through his fourth uncle, Li Chejing, there would be no need for Xiao Guiluan to seek aid from her family.
Her words indicated that she had no paternal backing, preventing interference from her maternal family. Mentioning her brothers was likely to make it clear to Li Yuanjiao that she was not without support and should not be mistreated after marriage.
He smirked, thinking to himself, What a clever woman!
He then reined in his horse and gently reassured her, "Don't worry. As long as I am here, no one will dare to bully you."
"Hmm," came the warm response from inside.
The girl was in the carriage, and the boy was on horseback. As night fell, illuminated by the gentle moonlight, Li Yuanjiao couldn't help but laugh quietly to himself.
