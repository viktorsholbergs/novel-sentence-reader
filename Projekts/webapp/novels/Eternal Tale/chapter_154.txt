Outside the Five Elements Sect, Chen Xun and the big black ox did not travel through the air. They reverted to their original appearance and wandered around the nearby city, buying some food. Their silver coins were quite valuable.
However, they heard that the royal family of the Qian Nation had undergone a generational change and was no longer the Shi family.
Upon hearing this, Chen Xun sighed and couldn't help but feel a sense of impermanence.
Outside the city, the two of them strolled along the road; both sides of the big black ox were filled with foodâ€”buns and meals from restaurants.
"Old Ox, the plan for the future is to improve our strength," said Chen Xun, holding a string of candied fruits and chewing slowly. "Otherwise, we'll be timid about everything in this world."
"Moo moo," the ox nodded dumbly, its tongue curling up as it ate one of Chen Xun's candied fruits.
That feeling of being respected as an ancestor was still quite comfortable for it. With strength, everyone reasoned together, and everything was harmonious.
"Although our old friends have passed away, we still have to live, right?" Chen Xun's eyes were now filled with openness. He was no longer so anxious. "Old Ox, we made a promise to take them to see the future."
"Moo moo!" The big black ox stopped eating, its gaze momentarily absent-minded. It kicked its hind hooves twice, suddenly feeling happy.
It didn't have as many thoughts as Chen Xun. As long as it could accumulate merits and perform rituals for them, it would have a good next life and be able to meet them again.
Chen Xun glanced at the big black ox and chuckled, "The road ahead is long. With the blessing of heaven and merits, what are we afraid of?"
"Moo!" The ox excitedly yelled, its last trace of sadness disappearing. It kept rubbing against Chen Xun, its eyes filled with joy.
Chen Xun hugged it, feeling a bit sentimental. Being respected as an ancestor was really fascinating and quite pleasant.
Just then, a cloud of dust rose ahead.
A group of martial artists were galloping on horseback along the official road, their eyes sharp.
"Get out of the way!" Several people scolded the cattle herders ahead, "Don't you have eyes?!"
"What the hell, looking for trouble?!" Chen Xun was shocked.
It had been a long time since he had felt like this. Could they be scolded even when walking along the edge of the official road with the big black ox?
"Moo!"
The big black ox spat out a mouthful of saliva, directly spitting it out. What kind of presence were they trying to establish here?
"Sigh~~"
The three of them stopped their horses, and the wind and sand blew on Chen Xun and the ox's faces.
A burly man angrily shouted, "Get out of the way, didn't you hear?!"
At this moment, a horse-drawn carriage was coming from behind, looking very noble. Inside was a man with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, holding a white paper fan, exuding a powerful aura.
He only glanced briefly at Chen Xun on the side of the road, his eyes full of indifference.
After a moment, there was a loud bang.
Smoke and dust billowed on the official road, people fell off their horses, begging for mercy. The carriage cover was lifted into the air, and all four wheels of the carriage were crushed.
The man remained seated on the carriage; the paper fan broken in half. His pupils were trembling, his body stiff, and his black hair scattered in the smoke and dust.
"Immortal Master, forgive us!"
"We beg for forgiveness, Immortal Master!!
The surrounding guards kept kneeling and begging for mercy, looking at the two figures disappearing into the distance.
"I didn't know what you were pretending to do?! Are you used to bullying ordinary people?!"
"Moo moo moo!"
From a distance came the sound of two voices cursing. The martial artists here kept bowing and kneeling, with snot and tears streaming down their faces.
Who could have imagined that the seemingly ordinary cattle herder on the road was actually an old monster!! Originally, they had wanted to show off in front of their young masters, but unexpectedly, they kicked the iron plate of an immortal.
On the road, Chen Xun and the big black ox chuckled, and they went to the underground cave dwelling on their own.
Before entering, they had already spread out their divine consciousness and circled the mountain range inside and out several times.
They even ran to the top of the high peak to observe for a long time. They didn't miss anything in the sky before finally returning to the dense forest.
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox ran in a meadow, remembering the smell and faintly sensing the formation it had set up. Even if this place were flattened, it wouldn't affect them finding their underground cave dwelling.
"Not bad, Old Ox," Chen Xun praised sincerely. "It seems you're getting closer to my strength."
"Moo?"
"Really, keep up the good work, Black Ox." Chen Xun stood with his hands behind his back, exuding an air of superiority. "Big brother's strength is unimaginable because it's already beyond your imagination."
"Moo~~~!" The big black ox's eyes widened, its tail wagging slower. It believed him again.
"Alright, let's go." Chen Xun laughed heartily, and a rainbow light surrounded them. "Old Ox, start drilling."
"Moo~"
The ground turned into a swamp again, and the two figures quickly submerged, disappearing completely underground.
In the underground cave dwelling, there was light everywhere. The Crane Spirit Trees were constantly burning themselves, illuminating Chen Xun and the black ox.
The wood of the Crane Spirit Trees was naturally extraordinary. Chen Xun ignited the Five Elements Fire attribute.
Several Jade Source Fruit trees had already borne fruit, but there was a limit to their age. When they reached three thousand years, the fruits would fall directly, and they couldn't continue to grow older.
The entire cave was filled with the fragrance of Jade Source Fruit, refreshing people's spirits.
"Old Ox, focus on the Jade Source Fruits." Chen Xun surveyed the cave and breathed a sigh of relief. "I'll leave the cultivation of spiritual herbs to you, and I'll focus on alchemy."
"Moo~~" The big black ox grinned, completely without any problems.
Its storage bag was full of water, so even if it needed herbs that grew in water, it wouldn't make any mistakes.
"Start the final push to the pinnacle of Golden Core!"
"Moo!!"
After a roar, they had no worries in their hearts, living only for themselves with the spirits of their deceased friends in heaven.
After encouraging each other, Chen Xun rushed into the alchemy room, while the big black ox rushed into the beast spirit room.
Both places began to shimmer with spiritual light, appearing extremely busy.
They spent their years of cultivation in this busy yet comfortable underground cave dwelling. They never secluded themselves for cultivation but always explored and experimented together.
Because of their defense, Chen Xun was quite reckless, constantly testing the limits of medicinal herbs. The fire also continuously controlled its path towards the limit. After several years, a truly mutated True Yuan Pill began to take shape, with mysterious and intricate patterns spread all over it.
The rich medicinal power made Chen Xun's and the big black ox's eyelids twitch. He also felt quite unsure. If the medicinal power was too strong, the practitioner would directly ascend to immortality, which would become a joke for eternity.
He was just practicing the limits of alchemy techniques. They didn't lack pills or spiritual herbs, so he dispersed them later and continued with alchemy.
The big black ox was also constantly learning formations, and pillars of spiritual energy often rose in the beast spirit room.
Chen Xun felt that the Five Elements Formation had become even more substantial, and he couldn't help but marvel. He had thought it was quite outrageous when the big black ox broke through the Five Elements Sect's protective mountain formation.
With just two formation flags, a wave of his hand, and a gap appeared. At that time, even Chen Xun was stunned, but there was an urgent matter, so he didn't think much about it.
Sometimes, when they felt a bit tired from cultivation, they would go out to play, hunt, admire the scenery, listen to storytelling in the city, or bring back some food.
Time has lost its sensitivity for them now. As long as they had a direction in mind, it was enough.
