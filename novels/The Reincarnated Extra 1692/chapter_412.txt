The Return of the “Weakling”
* * *
This is a side story related to Arc 16.
The Dagei Trench.
This is a huge fissure in the earth that runs through the bottom of the ocean exactly halfway between the Golden Continent and the Fantasy Continent.
Its depths are so deep that even the people of the super ancient magical civilization that once boasted prosperity could not reach the deepest parts.
All the more so for modern humans with declining technological capabilities, the depths of this Dagei Trench can truly be called an unknown world.
Now then, what kind of place is this Dagei Trench, whose actual state is hardly known to humans… Let me explain briefly.
First of all, if you dive to the bottom of the trench, sunlight naturally doesn’t reach it.
However, surprisingly…
The bottom of the Dagei Trench is quite bright.
The reason being, several types of luminescent sea squirts have proliferated there in great numbers.
The sandy bottom of the trench and the steep cliffs are densely packed with green and yellow glowing sea squirts.
It’s like a beautifully lit garden, a beautiful and fantastical world spreads out there.
And seeking the light of those sea squirts, plankton gather.
Seeking the plankton, small fish gather.
Seeking the small fish, larger fish gather.
…A rich ecosystem has formed there.
And furthermore.
There exist intelligent giant sea creatures that gather in this trench seeking those large fish, living in several clans.
Those are the Sea Serpents.

“Pyuru…”
Now, in a dwelling carved out of the cliff of the Dagei Trench, a female Sea Serpent inadvertently let out a sad voice as she coiled up.
Her name is Hayunagi.
With shimmering green scales on her long body, she’s an absolute beauty even by Sea Serpent standards.
She originally had a bright, lively, and slightly selfish personality.
And yet, for the past 100 years… her large eyes are always downcast, and she’s always sighing, bubbling sadly.
Her father was a great Sea Serpent who long served as the clan chief of the Zi clan to which she belongs.
Her father was wise, gentle, and kind.
The respected rule of her father would continue forever, and the Zi clan would continue to prosper.
Hayunagi of 100 years ago believed that without a doubt.
But her future was completely painted over that day, by the bright red blood shed by a sudden atrocity.
The name of the male who committed that atrocity is Gejugu.
A rough Sea Serpent with jet-black scales, giant muscles, and just as much excess fat.
At the annual feast, Gejugu suddenly attacked Hayunagi’s father along with his “unknown” rough Sea Serpent subordinates, killing him!
He became the new ruler of the Zi clan!
The violence of him and his subordinates was tremendous, and the Zi clan was instantly dominated by fear.
Even the warriors who initially took an anti-Gejugu stance soon surrendered to Gejugu, valuing their lives.
However…
Just one.
Only one small “weakling” who felt indebted to the previous clan chief resisted Gejugu until the end.
But his end was miserable.
Half-dead, he was dragged out of the peaceful Dagei Trench by Gejugu’s subordinates and thrown away somewhere like garbage.
He was poor at hunting and had a small body.
And with those wounds…
He’s probably no longer alive.
“Pyuru…”
Recently, Hayunagi has found herself thinking only of him.
In the past… she bullied him, calling him a weakling.
She even made him cut off and present his own tail…
That childhood friend of hers.
But even though Hayunagi treated him so horribly…
He alone got angry for her father.
And for Hayunagi.
But Hayunagi couldn’t do anything for him.
All she could do was tremble in fear as she watched Gejugu’s subordinates laughing while tormenting him.
She bears responsibility for his death too.
So this is her punishment.
Today, Hayunagi… will mate with Gejugu.

At the bottom of the Dagei Trench, where marine snow falls heavily.
In one corner, in addition to the luminescent sea squirts that originally grew in clusters, luminescent jellyfish, luminescent squid and octopuses, luminescent small fish, and swimming-type luminescent sea slugs have been gathered, creating a fantastical, almost tastelessly lit-up space.
<<<Gupopo… You finally came, Hayunagi. Making your “husband” wait… Gupopo, you’re a bad “wife”…!>>>
Waiting there was Gejugu, the current Zi clan chief.
Having grown several times fatter than 100 years ago, he laughed lecherously, twisting his ugly features.
<<<…>>>
Hayunagi, who arrived late, landed on the luminescent sea squirt field without a word.
By the way, Gejugu just called himself “husband” and Hayunagi “wife”, but that will only be officially recognized after the “mating ceremony” that will take place after this.
However, there is no one in the Zi clan who can point that out.
The entire Zi clan is now dominated by Gejugu.
<<<Oh, oh! Gupopo, Hayunagi, you are indeed always beautiful! Really, these past 100 years! The frustration of not being able to mate with you for these 100 years! Do you understand… how painful it was for me, Hayunagi! I’ve never lamented being a Sea Serpent as much as I have these past 100 years!>>>
Saying that, Gejugu flicked his long tongue and licked Hayunagi’s face.
Hayunagi closed her eyes tightly and endured the unpleasant feeling.
<<<But, that patience ends today! Right, Hayunagi? From now on, let’s live happily together, forever and ever! HAYUNAGIIIIIII!!!>>>
Gejugu shouted.
And with his thick tail, he… hit Hayunagi’s face with all his might!
<<<Ah, guh…!?>>>
Sudden violence!
Gejugu repeatedly struck Hayunagi, who was thrown against the sea squirt field without understanding why!
<<<But you know!! You hate it, don’t you!! You hate it too, right!! Having a violent guy like me as your mate!! You hate me too, don’t you!!!>>>
<<<Ah, ow, it hurts! It hurts… stop it!?>>>
<<<So understand this!! You can’t defy me!! You can’t win against me!! Be obedient!! You are!! My!! Wife!! GUPOPOPOPO!!!>>>
Atrocious!
Gejugu’s treatment can be summed up in that one word!
However, there is no longer a Sea Serpent in the Zi clan who can stop him…!
<<<Aah, uh, guuh…!>>>
Hayunagi, too, can only endure.
If she takes a defiant attitude here, she knows what will happen.
<<<Gupopopopo!!! Gupopopopo!!!>>>
Only Gejugu’s roaring laughter echoes at the bottom of the Dagei Trench.
<<<Ah, someone…>>>
Hayunagi couldn’t help but wish.
Even though… in her heart, she thought there couldn’t be such a “someone”.
<<<Someone, help me…!!>>>
She couldn’t help but wish that!
And!
Her wish, which she thought would reach no one…!
Certainly reached… “him”!!
<<<【Drill Vortex】!!>>>
At that moment.
Hayunagi heard a nostalgic voice that she recognized… but shouldn’t be hearing now.
And the next instant!
<<<Gupo!?>>>
A spear-like ocean current with a swirling vortex hit Gejugu’s face directly!
The power of that vortex spear was so tremendous that Gejugu’s giant body was blown away… and crashed into the cliff of the Dagei Trench!
<<<Eh…!?>>>
Hayunagi opened her eyes slightly.
And there, as if shielding her with his back turned, confronting Gejugu who had crashed into the cliff…
Was a small-bodied Sea Serpent with deep blue and black striped scales.
It was… her childhood friend, whom she thought had died!
Hayunagi, her voice filled with astonishment and joy, involuntarily shouted his name!
<<<Zaratopu!?>>>
<<<Hayunagi… Sorry I’m late…!>>>
Zaratopu glanced back at Hayunagi, and seeing her pitiful state… made a pathetic, tearful expression he used to make often in the past.
But that was only for a moment.
He immediately turned to face Gejugu, who had pulled himself out of the cliff, and glared at this evil Sea Serpent.
Zaratopu’s back… was small.
His body was clearly small compared to other Sea Serpents.
Especially compared to Gejugu, he was overwhelmingly small.
But.
To Hayunagi.
Zaratopu’s back right now.
For some reason… seemed very, very reliable…!
<<<Aaaaaah!? Who the hell are youuuu!? What are you suddenly doiiiiing!? I’ll kill youuuu!?>>>
The enraged Gejugu unleashed his 【Intimidation】 at full power, blood trailing from his mouth!
The terrifying 【Intimidation】 that had made all of the Zi clan prostrate themselves!
But Zaratopu was unfazed!
<<<What’s with you… Is that all you’ve got?>>>
<<<Aaaah!?>>>
Zaratopu, with fighting spirit burning in his eyes!
<<<If that’s the case, that squid…!>>>
With a fearless smile!
<<<That shrimp…!>>>
His body trembling with excitement!
<<<That barnacle…!>>>
Wrapping his entire body in seawater controlled by his own magical power!
<<<And more than anyone… Anego!!>>>
He began to charge straight… towards Gejugu!
<<<Were faaaar… scarier than you!!!>>>
The battle that would determine the future of the Zi clan… had begun!!
To be continued… not.
