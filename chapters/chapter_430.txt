Li Yuanjiao spent half a year in seclusion to stabilize his cultivation. With the aid of a talisman pill, he successfully broke through to the ninth layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and could finally see the hope of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.
Now that he had emerged from seclusion, he inquired about the situation at home and found that most of the clan's cultivators had also retreated into seclusion.
The situation with the devil plague clan had eased, and many overdue clan wages were settled. Some had made progress in their cultivation, while others had saved enough to purchase pills to aid in their breakthroughs.
Li Qinghong had improved significantly after a period of combating the devil plague. However, she was still accumulating her cultivation in the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm and had yet to break through to the eighth heavenly layer.
As soon as Li Yuanjiao left his seclusion, he received a letter from Smoke Valley Temple. Chen Donghe had finally managed to gather a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin spiritual qi, which brought Li Yuanjiao great joy. He requested Li Qinghong to oversee the family and set off westward personally.
However, upon crossing Mount Xiping and arriving at Smoke Valley Temple, Li Yuanjiao's joy quickly turned to dismay.
The ancient city wall, which had once stretched for thousands of li, had collapsed in several places, leaving it fractured into three or four sections. The remaining portions of the wall were now mottled and cracked.
Chen Donghe flew toward him and greeted him. His face was still pale and he seemed to have gained fresh wounds before his old wounds had even fully recovered.
Li Yuanjiao pointed at the damaged wall and frowned in silence. Chen Donghe quickly explained, "It was the work of those devil cultivators. Many frequently crossed the border this year. While most were just passing by, some grew greedy and besieged Smoke Valley Temple… During the battles, the ancient city wall was repeatedly impacted, leading to its current state."
Chen Donghe sighed and continued with a tinge of sadness evident in his voice, "This was also why the progress of gathering the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spirit qi had been delayed by half a year. The wall, which used to be able to support three people for qi harvesting, can now accommodate only two."
Li Yuanjiao felt a headache coming. Repairing the wall would not resolve the issue; the Golden Yang Radiant Origin required the presence of an ancient pass. Further repairs might just jeopardize this qi gathering location.
Should I send people to protect this place?
Li Yuanjiao was aware that there were only very few people in the main family who could fight. Sending more people to protect this place would only further delay their cultivation and expose them to danger.
"This place is too dilapidated; the qi gathering efficiency is very low. We may need to send someone to search for another suitable site," Li Yuanjiao concluded, taking the jade box from Chen Donghe.
He opened it gently, revealing the flowing red and golden light within, and nodded in pleased approval. He then asked, "Does Auntie know about Granduncle's situation? He's her uncle. Perhaps both of you should take a trip back to the clan to pay your respects."
Chen Donghe understood Li Yuanjiao's intention. Taking a trip back to the clan implied that they still had to return here and continue gathering the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spirit qi.
Despite this, Chen Donghe replied, "I'll have to trouble you to escort her back to the clan to pay her respects. It's becoming increasingly difficult to gather qi here… I'd better seize the opportunity to gather more, so I won't be returning with her."
Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement, then sent someone to fetch Li Jingtian. Shortly afterward, the messenger returned to him and informed him that Li Jingtian refused to return home. She would, however, offer distant respects and put on a mourning garb as a gesture of courtesy.
Chen Donghe sighed softly, then bowed slightly to Li Yuanjiao in apology.
Li Yuanjiao understood the gesture and left behind several medicine pills and resources before riding the wind and departing into the smoky sunset, vanishing into the yellow haze alone.
As Li Yuanjiao disappeared from view, Chen Donghe straightened up. He took a seat and leaned against the city wall, staring at the slowly setting sun. He suddenly felt a pang of loneliness.
At sixty years old, with Tian Youdao gone, he had one person less to reminisce about the past with.
"The sunset is blood red, the earth veins are stirring… It seems the fire veins have erupted again," he mumbled quietly to himself.
There were many fire veins in this desert, making it an inhospitable place for mortals. Li Jingtian's health had been declining and she had grown stubborn. When she was younger, she never left Li Yuanjiao in such a difficult position.
Xiao'er... I wonder how she's doing these days...
Chen Donghe, who practiced the River One Qi Technique, should ideally remain near water or the lake. Due to years in the desert, his cultivation had stagnated. He did not seem to mind though. Sitting silently on the gray-white city wall, he hummed a few lines of songs from his hometown.
Li Yuanjiao returned home in a gloomy state and sat on a rock for two hours, gradually regaining his composure. Just as his mood began to lift, he received word that Li Xijun had arrived.
"Have him come up," Li Yuanjiao instructed.
After a brief wait, Li Xijun appeared in a brocade robe. The dharma artifact, Glazed Dusk, had been carefully embedded into a jade ring that hung from his waist, swaying with his every movement like a beautiful pendant.
"Greetings, Second Uncle," Li Xijun greeted, cupping his fists in a respectful yet relaxed manner.
Li Yuanjiao assessed him with his spiritual sense and noted, "I see you've condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and reached the Fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm… Jade Capital Wheel. You've certainly worked hard."
At sixteen years old, Li Xijun was at the height of his potential. His talent, while impressive, was slightly inferior to that of Li Ximing, who was also nearing the Jade Capital stage at the Xiao residence.
Li Xijun responded humbly to his second uncle's praise. Li Yuanjiao, knowing he had come to request a talisman pill, retrieved a jade bottle from his storage pouch and handed it over.
Li Xijun and Li Ximing would reach the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm after taking this talisman pill. However, there was only a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi available.
After carefully choosing his words, Li Yuanjiao said warmly, "Jun'er, we only have a portion of Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi at home. Given the issues with the qi source in the desert, it may be over ten years before we can acquire another portion…"
Li Xijun nodded, mildly surprised to find himself in a similar situation that his elder brother, Li Xicheng, had previously faced. However, his personality was completely different from Li Xicheng. He merely responded respectfully, saying, "Xijun will obey the elder's commands!"
He did not give Li Yuanjiao an easy way out, so Li Yuanjiao fell silent. Li Xijun lowered his gaze and waited for two breaths until he could no longer bear watching the guilt on his elder's face.
He smiled and continued, "Xijun is rather fond of the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique. It's cold and ethereal, suitable for swordsmanship. That Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual sounds like an overblown show of wealth and lacks appeal."
Li Xijun's attempt at joking did little to lift Li Yuanjiao's spirits. The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual was only a Grade Three cultivation technique, while the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual was a rare Grade Four ancient technique. Consuming the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi would determine one's path for the next century.
This was a serious matter that impacted the lives of all the precious descendants of the Li Family, not a joke that one could simply laugh and forget about. Li Yuanjiao was overwhelmed by emotions and frustrations, yet found himself unable to articulate them. In the end, all he could do was sigh.
"Once you stabilize your cultivation after the breakthrough, you can retrieve the Cold Pine Snow Qi from the foot of the mountain and prepare for the next step," he said.
He then retrieved the Slaughter Jun Kui Light manual and handed it over to Li Xijun apologetically. In an unusually gentle tone, he said, "This is the latest Grade Four spell our family has acquired… Study it carefully first before you begin practicing it slowly. Return to me when you're able to absorb cold qi and cold water."
Unlike the Cold Pine Snow Qi, the bottle of Earth Fiend's Cold Spring at home was a limited resource. Initially, Li Yuanjiao was hesitant to use this spell. However, after carefully reviewing the manual and discovering that only a small amount of spirit water was required, he decided to provide it.
"Thank you, Second Uncle!"
Li Xijun nodded calmly, then accepted the manual and carefully read its contents. After swearing the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, he cupped his fist and took his leave.
After he departed, a thought struck Li Yuanjiao. He wrote a letter, which he handed to a subordinate and instructed, "Go to Xianyou Peak and find out Ximing's cultivation progress. See if he has broken through to the Jade Capital stage then return quickly."
"Wait."
He retracted the letter and added something to it, then said, "Have him request to come home; I'll fetch him myself."
