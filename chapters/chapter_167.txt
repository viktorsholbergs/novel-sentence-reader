Li Yuanxiu stood in the courtyard, holding a sword as Li Yuanjiao, dressed in a black robe, swung his sword around, cutting through the cold wind sharply and producing several whooshing sounds. His hands turned white from the grip, and the sword was heavy, causing sweat to appear on Li Yuanjiao's face.
Li Yuanxiu patted Li Yuanjiao's shoulder, correcting the way he held the sword, and asked warmly, "Jiao'er, how long have you been practicing the Profound Water Sword Technique?"
"A little over two years," Li Yuanjiao responded softly. Li Yuanxiu corrected a few of his mistakes and then a young boy, appearing younger than Li Yuanxiu, entered.
He cupped his fist to them and said, "Brother, Father asks for your presence on the mountain."
"All right."
Li Yuanxiu nodded to Li Yuanyun in front of him and instructed, "Go to the east courtyard and tell them I won't be dealing with affairs for now."
Behind them, Li Pingyi had grown taller and more robust than his father, Li Xiewen. He nodded in response and left while Li Yuanxiu then followed Li Yuanyun up the mountain.
Li Xuanling was sitting in the courtyard, pondering deeply as he watched the tea leaves floating around in his cup. Li Tongya had instructed him to disclose the matter of the mirror to Li Yuanxiu and the others, filling him with worry and unease.
He had already known that his son, Li Yuanyun, lacked a spiritual orifice since long ago. Even so, he still harbored some hope that the mirror might choose Li Yuanyun and resolve the issue.
However, after kneeling before the mirror, Li Xuanling accepted reality. With a mix of emotions in his heart, he watched his child run around on the mountain. He could not help but worry.
"What to do with this child…"
From a young age, Li Xuanling saw his third uncle, Li Xiangping, show particular affection toward Li Jingtian. Now, experiencing it firsthand, he realized it was more than just simple love... To claim he felt no guilt or sorrow would be something Li Xuanling could not bring himself to believe.
There was then a knock at the door, and Li Yuanyun led Li Yuanxiu inside.
After a long conversation the previous night about his lack of a spiritual orifice, which had left Li Yuanyun in tears, he seemed more cheerful today—almost as though trying to comfort his father.
"Greetings, Clan Uncle!" Li Yuanxiu greeted as he cupped his fist while Li Yuanyun stepped outside tactfully.
Li Xuanling lowered his gaze, then turned to Li Yuanxiu.
"I've called you here today because there are some family matters you should be aware of, now that you've condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra…"
Li Xuanling had thoroughly sorted through his thoughts before summoning Li Yuanxiu today. Carefully choosing his words, he continued, "Our family has inherited a dharma artifact from our ancestors—an extraordinary bluish-gray mirror, far surpassing the Foundation Establishment Realm, which is capable of performing many miracles."
He described the marvelous uses of the mirror in detail, citing examples from past events. Li Yuanxiu listened with joy, and then Li Xuanling continued, "Some days ago when I took you all and sealed your senses in the courtyard, it was to seek these talisman seeds. Your younger cousins, Yuanjiao and Qinghong, were chosen and have already received a talisman seed in their Shenyang Mansion."
Without mentioning the fact that the talisman seed could be bestowed upon any individual through request and instead emphasizing that only those favored by the mirror could receive one was a tactful move to avoid hurting the feelings of Li Yuanxiu.
The eldest of the fourth generation remained oblivious to this, reacting happily to the news.
"That's truly wonderful!"
There was a fleeting sadness in his eyes as he quietly added, "I feel sorry for Yuanyun though."
This comment hit right at Li Xuanling's sore spot. He nodded somberly and said, "Yuanyun cannot cultivate, and there are many things he can't confide with me because I am his father... The days ahead will be tough for him, and I will need you to look after him more, Xiu'er."
Li Yuanxiu nodded solemnly. The two talked for a long time, from discussing the threatening Yu Family to the remotely supportive Xiao Family. Many of Li Yuanxiu's insights impressed Li Xuanling. They talked late into the night before Li Xuanling had him swear the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, then sent him off.
"With such a boy to lead the family, we have nothing to worry about in the future."
Li Xuanling's mood had improved considerably. Watching Li Yuanxiu descend the mountain, he nodded in satisfaction and turned to continue his cultivation.
Xiao Yuansi paid a visit to his great ancestor Xiao Chuting and his nephew Xiao Yongling at home before finally being able to leave. He rode the wind along the Guli Road, passing over layers of forests until he reached the territory of the Li Family.
The simple Misty Maze Formation on Mount Lijing had now been replaced by a complex, shimmering gold formation, earning Xiao Yuansi's nod of approval.
Although this formation was nothing particularly impressive to a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm like him, it showed considerable progress in the Li Family over the years.
Standing outside the formation, Xiao Yuansi spoke apprehensively, "Xiao Yuansi from Qingsui Peak…"
After a moment of thought, he corrected himself, "Xiao Yuansi of the Xiao Family in Lixia has come to visit… Please open the mountain gate!"
There was a noticeable delay before a small opening was created. Xiao Yuansi retracted his mana and descended, only to be greeted by a junior he had never met before… but seemed oddly familiar.
The junior cupped his fist and introduced himself.
"Greetings, Senior! I am Li Xuanxuan from the Li Family. My elders are currently in seclusion, please come rest in the courtyard."
Xiao Yuansi nodded lightly, holding back his curiosity about the junior's parents, and sat down. While waiting for Li Tongya and the others, he savored his tea.
Just as he organized his thoughts, Li Tongya arrived at the door. After dismissing everyone else, there were only the two of them left in the courtyard. Li Tongya cupped his fist respectfully.
"Greetings, Senior!"
Xiao Yuansi looked at him sentimentally, noticing his graying temples. "You've aged. Where's Xiangping?" he asked softly.
Li Tongya looked down, concealing the emotions that swirled in his eyes as he answered, "Due to an agreement between the two sects… Mount Yue's eastward invasion had forced Xiangping to his death."
Already burdened with guilt, Xiao Yuansi felt as if a heavy hammer had struck him, hard. He untied the green sword around his waist and handed it over, saying softly, "Jing'er… he… is gone."
Although Li Tongya was already aware of this, he still failed to stop his tears. He accepted the sword with both hands and managed to choke out his reply.
"I lost my elder brother at twenty years old, then my parents and younger brothers, one after the other. Now… I'm the only one left."
Although Xiao Yuansi was a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm, these few words from Li Tongya stirred him to tears. Recalling his promise to take care of Jing'er when he was refining pills in the Li Family, he clenched his teeth.
"T-Tongya… I… I've let you down."
Li Tongya suddenly raised his eyebrows and spoke softly.
"Senior Xiao… I only have one question. How did Jing'er die..?"
Struggling internally, Xiao Yuansi's face turned red before he spoke.
"He was sacrificed by the Chi Family… given to demons in the southern border to be refined into a pill! My master is still locked away in the tower, and I am too powerless to do anything…"
"So… it was the Chi Family!"
Knowing that the Chi Family held significant power within the Azure Pond Sect and were most capable of such deeds, Li Tongya bowed and expressed his gratitude.
"Thank you, Senior!"
"I do not deserve any of that."
Xiao Yuansi sighed as he shook his head. Eager to break the somber atmosphere, he changed the topic and said, "Junior Brother also entrusted me with many things to bring back, all of which I now hand over to you."
"The most precious among them is this Qingche Sword."
Upon saying this, Xiao Yuansi pointed to the sword sheathed in his hand and explained, "This sword was forged by the master of Yuanwu Peak using seven feet of Qingming Copper from Mount Azure Pond, along with thirty-two kinds of heavenly materials and spirit items. When it was made, it wasn't at the Foundation Establishment Realm. After my junior brother nurtured it day and night, aligning its sword intent with the sword body, it broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, endowing the Qingche Sword with a great degree of spirituality. It accumulated a pure Celestial Moon Sword Intent, elevating it to a dharma artifact of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Jing'er instructed me to ensure it was returned to your family."
Xiao Yuansi shook his head and sighed.
"However, after it came into my possession, the sword refused to unsheathe, appearing dull and lackluster even when summoned with my mana. It seems to have developed its own consciousness and refuses to be wielded by my hands."
