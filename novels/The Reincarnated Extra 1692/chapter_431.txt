At the Bottom of the Giant Hole
* * *
This is what they call an overwhelming force.
Kobdalian’s Red and Blue Kobudai Allied Forces continued to advance deeper into the forbidden grounds with tremendous force.
Sporadically, Black Kobu warriors appeared and attacked the Allied Forces, but they brushed them all aside.
The Black Kobu Tribe specializes in fighting in groups.
Being ambushed by strong warriors before they could prepare, they had no chance.
Therefore, the Allied Forces suffered almost no casualties.
They swiftly swam through the narrow Dontgo Valley…
And reached a wide… presumably wide… space.
* * *
<<<What is this place…? >>>
Kobdalian, emerging from the narrow valley path with cliffs on both sides, muttered involuntarily.
Because the fog was incredibly thick here.
Even for Kobudai, who were born and raised at the bottom of the Eserem Sea of Fog, and are accustomed to fog, it was so hard to see that they were confused.
He could somehow sense that this place was a large space, but because of the fog, he couldn’t grasp its full extent.
<<<This fog… in other words, this is probably the source of all the fog in the Eserem Sea of Fog.>>>
Even Kobdacleva’s figure, muttering those words, was barely visible, just a blurry silhouette, despite being so close.
<<<Does that mean…>>>
<<<This is the Calamity excavation site.>>>
<<<I see… Hmph!!>>>
Hearing that, Kobdalian canceled the 【Raging Flames】 enveloping him, took a deep breath, and released his mana.
Then, a spherical wind, centered on his body, blew away the surrounding fog.
And before the Kobudai warriors… a giant, funnel-shaped hole appeared!
It was such a huge hole that the bottom was still covered in thick fog, making it impossible to see the details.
<<<Ha… What an outrageous display of power… As expected of a Kobudai who became Clan Chief at such a young age.>>>
Kobdacleva chuckled wryly, seeing Kobdalian’s forceful, unorthodox way of clearing the fog, relying on his vast mana reserves.
<<<Stop flattering me… Kobdarok… and the Calamity are at the bottom of this hole, right? >>>
<<<That’s right.>>>
Kobdalian and Kobdacleva nodded to each other, glaring at the bottom of the hole, where the fog still lingered.
<<<Then… let’s go! It’s time to settle things with the wicked Black Kobu Tribe who broke the taboo!!>>>
<<<UOOOOOOOOOHーーー!!!>>>
Kobdalian declared that, and then, continuously releasing his mana to clear the fog, started swimming vigorously towards the bottom of the hole.
The Red Kobu warriors roared and followed him.
<<<…>>>
On the other hand, Kobdacleva and the Blue Kobu warriors, in contrast, silently nodded to each other and followed them quietly.
* * *
A few minutes later.
Kobdalian and the others, reaching the bottom of the giant hole, and advancing straight ahead, finally found something.
<<<Th-This is…! >>>
<<<There’s no mistake… this is…>>>
<<<…The Calamity…!!>>>
The Red Kobu warriors exclaimed in astonishment.
Clan Chief Kobdalian also trembled, seeing the being that appeared from the fog.
It’s a roughly triangular object, bound tightly with cloth and ropes, endlessly emitting a terrifying presence…
Just by its shape, it closely resembled a creature that the Kobudai often see.
Yes.
In other words…
The true identity of the Calamity, ‘Humidafai, the Fog Bringer’…
…Is a super giant turban shell… easily exceeding the height of a three-story building, just with the visible part of its shell…
“BUSHUWAWAWAWA!”
<<<!?>>>
The Red Kobu warriors, startled by its size, were staring at it, dumbfounded, when!
The super giant turban shell… Calamity Humidafai… made that sound!
Kobdalian and the others instinctively braced themselves… but it was just the sound of fog being forcefully released from the hole at the tip of Humidafai’s shell.
Humidafai itself doesn’t move, with more than half of its body buried in the ground.
They could feel a terrifying presence… but no hostility or killing intent…
<<<It’s sleeping…? >>>
<<<It seems the seal hasn’t been broken yet. Look at that.>>>
Kobdacleva, swimming beside him, pointed his chin at the middle of the turban shell’s shell, in response to Kobdalian’s mutter.
A white, glowing starfish was clinging there.
And it seems that the cloth and ropes wrapped around Humidafai are extending from that starfish.
That starfish is probably the key to the seal that the outer god, ‘Sealing God’, placed.
<<<So we made it in time? But… wait, where’s Kobdarok? >>>
Kobdalian, recovering from the shock of learning Humidafai’s true identity, finally realized that Kobdarok, the Clan Chief of the Black Kobu Tribe, was nowhere to be found.
Not only that, they haven’t encountered any Black Kobu since they started advancing at the bottom of this hole.
This is strange.
Something is strange.
But Kobdalian wasn’t given time to ponder this question.
Because…
<<<Guhoho… Looking for me? >>>
A giant black Kobudai, splitting the fog, leisurely appeared before Kobdalian, accompanied by an eerie laugh!
This Kobudai’s body length easily surpasses Kobdalian’s, at about three meters!
His jet-black scales are rugged like rock, clearly boasting extraordinary hardness!
There’s no mistake.
There’s no way he could be mistaken.
This giant black Kobudai is…!
<<<‘Kobdarok, the Black Rock’… the Clan Chief of the Black Kobu Tribe…!!>>>
Kobdalian glared at Kobdarok, once again enveloping his body in 【Raging Flames】.
<<<Guhoho… Oh my, oh my, getting ready for battle as soon as you see me, young one? As expected of the foolish Clan Chief of the Red Kobu Tribe. Such barbarity is an embarrassment to all Kobudai. Well, still…>>>
But Kobdarok, on the other hand, remained completely composed.
<<<That foolishness… was very useful this time! Guhoho!!>>>
Laughing ferociously, Kobdarok glanced at the few Black Kobu warriors beside him and gave them some instructions with a movement of his chin.
<<<H-Hah!!>>>
The Black Kobu warriors who received the instructions immediately moved.
They dashed out in front of Kobdarok, but instead of charging straight at Kobdalian, they changed course midway, ascended, and started swimming in circles above Kobdalian and Kobdarok!
<<<What is this!? >>>
<<<What are they doing!? >>>
The Red Kobu warriors were frozen, confused by the Black Kobu warriors’ incomprehensible actions.
And then, a wind brushed against their cheeks.
<<<The fog… is clearing!? >>>
Someone then muttered.
And that act of “creating wind”… is what the spinning Black Kobu warriors are trying to do.
By spinning rapidly in place, they’re creating an updraft, blowing the fog that had settled at the bottom of the giant hole upwards!
As a result, a few dozen seconds later, the fog at the bottom of the giant hole was completely cleared.
Kobdalian looked around the bottom of the hole, now with clear visibility…
<<<…>>>
…And broke out in a cold sweat, speechless.
Because they, the Red and Blue Kobudai Allied Forces…
…Were surrounded… by about ten times as many Black Kobu warriors…
<<<Guhoho!! You thought your surprise attack was successful!? Too bad!!>>>
Kobdarok laughed hysterically, tears streaming down his face, as he looked at the shaken Red Kobu warriors!
<<<Your strategy was completely seen through! You were cleverly lured here… You fell into my trap!!>>>
