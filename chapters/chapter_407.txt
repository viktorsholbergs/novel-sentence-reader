The object, neither talisman nor seal, flipped and hovered slightly before condensing into a small bluish-gray orb that emitted flashes of mana light. It was easy to tell at first glance that it was no mundane artifact; it was the very treasure Li Yuanjiao remembered his family had discovered in a cave dwelling.
"I see… This was that person's last resort."
Chi Buzi recognized it instantly. After observing it briefly, he took a moment to chastise himself for his earlier greed. Who would have guessed that the Supreme Yin Moonlight was a lure set by that old schemer?
Suppressing his greed, Chi Buzi thought to himself, This old thing is probably an ancient monster by now… I shouldn't rush things and coax out his secrets first. Maybe within them lies my opportunity to form a core and acquire my own essence!
The shamanic spell was still rooted deep within his soul, yet Chi Buzi felt no fear as he focused on the talisman qi.
It's a mere shamanic spell… In eighty-three years, when the True Monarch emerges from his seclusion, this spell can be dispelled easily. But securing that ancient relic is truly a treasure, I must secure it before meeting the True Monarch!
While he contemplated his next move, the Water Mansion Immortal Official suddenly grew vigilant and snapped, "What concern is it of yours? This is the legacy of the immortal position bestowed by the Immortal Court! It's mine alone to claim… Don't even think about it!"
However, Chi Buzi was not really listening to him. He was fixated on the promise hidden within his words—A legacy of an immortal position! A chance at the Dao Embryo!
Breathing heavily, Chi Buzi's thoughts raced with possibilities.
Could it be true? Does this ancient being truly believe in the Immortal Court? If so, how can I ensure my safety against Pristine Water? The True Monarch is ruthless—once he learns of this, the Azure Pond Sect won't protect me… It could mean more than just my demise.
Chi Buzi was adept at quick thinking. Within moments, he had weighed all possible outcomes.
In this case, it's better to vanish overseas and plot quietly in secret to claim this legacy than to be silenced or killed.
He rubbed his tired eyes, only then noticing his horrible state. He organized his thoughts.
I Investigated the Moongaze Lake, searched the soul of a Li Family member… and fell into the trap of this old thing…
His divine abilities were impaired, and chaotic moonlight energy surged through his body—a direct consequence of his daring gaze upon the immortal position.
A decade or so of recovery should suffice.
Despite the potential risks, Chi Buzi felt indifferent; encountering such ancient relics was worth any personal loss, especially since the power of the immortal position seemed extraordinary at first encounter.
"First, I need to restore my eyes."
Rolling up his sleeves, Chi Buzi began scooping up some river mud, deftly molding it into two thumb-sized balls which he then inserted into his empty eye sockets.
The two mud balls fitted into his sockets nicely. Closing his eyes, he performed a hand seal and cast a divine ability. A burst of colorful light emerged, and when he opened his eyes again, the mud balls had become real eyeballs that could move around.
This will suffice for now! I must have damaged my eyes by gazing directly at that immortal position… I'll craft proper replacements once I return to my sect for some blood qi.
Now with his new eyes, Chi Buzi's vision had become clearer and his mind turned sharper.
Although he had tasted the formidable power of the ancient being when he assaulted his sea of consciousness, Chi Buzi remained skeptical.
Could the Dao Embryo legacy really be so easily obtained? I could not even scan it with my spiritual sense, who knows what it is? If Pristine Water believes this, I'll be as good as dead.
As this thought crossed his mind, Chi Buzi's expression hardened as if recalling something.
"Old thing, is the Li Family even aware of your existence?" he asked.
"I've hidden in their house for decades but never spoken to any of them and have long erased their memories," the Water Mansion Immortal Official replied nonchalantly.
The Immortal Official's tone was dismissive, but for Chi Buzi, it was a matter concerning his own safety. He whispered fiercely, "I'll go silence them and reclaim the divine ability that I've leaked while I'm at it!"
Although Azure Pond and Mount Dali had promised not to perform blood sacrifice in the northern foothills, there was no problem in killing a few mortals. As for the divine power, it was referring to the scattered blood beads on the ground.
Chi Buzi was not after those spirit items, knowing they would soon dissipate. However, he feared they might be exploited by others. He opened the void, only to be stopped by the Immortal Official's harsh admonition.
"How dare you commit such acts that defy the natural order!"
His words carried weight, and after counting silently to four, Chi Buzi sighed deeply and reluctantly halted, replying coldly, "What an old-fashioned man you are! We, who possess divine abilities, are not the same as those mere mortals and lowly cultivators… How absurd it is for us to be bound by the same moral constraints fabricated by the mundane world!"
The Immortal Official snorted coldly and was about to respond when Chi Buzi cut in sharply, "Let me ask you this, old thing… When the heavens and the earth were first formed, were there any morals, laws, or honor when there was nothing but the vast land?"
Caught off guard, the Immortal Official responded, "There were none."
Chi Buzi smiled coldly and then continued, "In the earliest days of humanity, those who emerged first were revered, while those who followed were deemed lesser. The powerful became emperors; the meek, their slaves. The so-called morality was nothing more than a set of rules crafted by the revered to control the lesser, by emperors to dominate their subjects, and by elders to discipline the young."
He continued, "When the elders died, and the young became wiser and ascended to power, they preserved the established order. Over time, it morphed into a system of superiority and inferiority, morality and etiquette."
"Morality and laws are mere constructs; they exist if you believe in them and vanish if you don't. Now, as a revered figure with divine abilities, I can set my own rules. Why should I bow to the whims of those long gone?" he challenged.
The Immortal Official retorted in anger, "Slaughtering the innocent and disrupting the peace of heaven… Do you not fear the repercussions of karma?"
Chi Buzi scoffed and muttered darkly, "Karma? It is but a toy in the hands of the Mahas, and the people are mere livestock under my divine abilities. How adorable do you think these creatures are? They despise me, yet they would eagerly take my place."
With a sinister smile, he added, "As for the repercussions, it's nothing more than a feeble cry… a pitiful delusion."
Despite the distance, Chi Buzi's location was still within the perception of Lu Jiangxian's divine sense. With the help of the shamanic spell in his soul and his own divine sense, Lu Jiangxian could read every thought in his mind.
"THis is the only thing I can do since Chi Buzi's visit was too abrupt…"
With talisman qi that could elude even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, Lu Jiangxian tried to bluff in away that would entice a potential Golden Core Realm cultivator. As long as Chi Buzi did not dare to gamble with Pristine Water's vision, it was naturally impossible for him to report anything.
The soul of the Immortal Official, though under Lu Jiangxian's influence, retained considerable autonomy. Armed with complete knowledge of Immortal Court systems from his past life and the Sacrificial Rituals Method's instructions in the mirror, he had managed to deceive Chi Buzi for the time being.
If contradictions arose, the Immortal Official would assume his fragmented memories were to blame, rather than suspect that his soul had been fabricated by another.
As long as Chi Buzi refrained from probing into the Pristine Water, the ever-watchful soul would ensure any slip led swiftly to his demise, which was far preferable to falling at Moongaze Lake.
"Once I finish using this man and ensure they won't be able to track me down, things will be easier."
Lu Jiangxian relaxed, a hint of anticipation coloring his face.
