"The experience is proving less applicable here. Hopefully, Old Ox won’t be tainted by the demon—this isn’t something that ends with a breakthrough."
Chen Xun’s black hair fluttered as a sharp light flashed in his eyes. He began deducing on the pages of his notebook.
“How to break the situation externally… The chance of awakening by oneself is too slim. Old Ox will surely be drawn in.”
A powerful aura swirled around him. He knew Old Ox too well, even down to his greatest vulnerabilities.
One by one, the notebooks were filled with writing, only to suddenly burn in the air.
On the shore—
“Moo!”
Big black ox’s eyes trembled. Why would Chen Xun destroy his notebooks? This had never happened before.
“Brother Ox?”
“Moo moo!”
Big black ox’s face grew serious. Chen Xun must be working on something of critical importance, something even beyond its understanding. After all, his eldest brother was the smartest person in existence—its guiding light of wisdom!
In the distant sky, Chen Xun sat silently, unmoving.
“This corrupted lifespan’s ascension of divine sense feels off. Perhaps it’s made the Heart Demon Tribulation even harder, with their involvement at play.”
His brows furrowed as he rapidly analyzed the situation in his mind.
“There’s no such thing as an easy gain. I wonder what happened to those cultivators who broke through to the Nascent Soul stage on the battlefield.”
And that so-called tribulation wasn’t normal either. The thunderous power there was vast and terrifying, yet its might fell short of the Heavenly Tribulation.
Nonetheless, the Heavenly Tribulation’s tempering power was incredibly pure, and he had fully exploited it.
Even the blackened earth beneath him was continuously repairing itself, thanks to the influence of the corrupted blood and the dense essence of heaven and earth!
His eyes widened as he looked at the abyss below, watching it visibly mend at an astonishing speed.
“Heavenly Tribulation, Heavenly Path… Do such things truly exist? Are these corrupted lifespans the failed creations of heaven and earth, born from the negativity of all living beings to fight mindlessly against creation itself?”
Chen Xun’s thoughts raced as his mind expanded. Gazing into the boundless darkness around him, he muttered,
“I, who seek immortality, may truly be the ultimate enemy of all creation. The Heavenly Tribulation could be the collective will of all beings, a subconscious manifestation of their deepest and most unintended hatred.”
He chuckled coldly.
“So, the Heavenly Path is the will of all things—each blade of grass, every drop of water, embodying its essence. All beings are part of the Heavenly Path, unaffected by one another. Such impartiality—this is true fairness!”
He exhaled deeply, his demeanor growing increasingly transcendent.
“The battlefield of realms… I see now. The corrupted lifespans are simply part of the whole. Immortals are indeed the true enemies of all creation!”
“Still, on my journey thus far, I have always treated all things with reverence. Save for the Crane Spirit Tree, I hope none of you will target us further.”
Chen Xun’s voice echoed into the void, carrying a mystical resonance.
“It seems that in these three thousand years of cultivation, I’ve been wrong. I always thought some unknown force was watching me, even while creating the Five Elements Immortal Path.”
A profound sense of release emanated from him, breaking countless shackles within his heart. It was a genuine freedom—untethered to cultivation or enlightenment.
“Corrupted lifespans… truly fascinating. The more one sees, the more humility it fosters. At the same time, one gains unparalleled clarity.”
With a serene smile, Chen Xun slowly spread his arms wide, shouting unabashedly across the battlefield of realms. His booming voice resonated in all directions.
“Brothers, we are free!!”
“Moo!!”
“Brother Xun, absolutely!!”
Rustling echoed in response.
Three figures on the shore joined in with affirming shouts and bold gestures.
Sometimes, freedom was contagious. They felt Chen Xun’s profound liberation—a joy they had also been pursuing all along. It was no coincidence they had ended up together; their bond was unbreakable!
At that moment, Little Red had many thoughts swirling in his heart. Brother Ox’s concern for their eldest brother was unwavering, yet he lacked the strength to discern the truth of the Heavenly Tribulation.
But Little Red had seen it with his own eyes—the earth-shattering lightning piercing the ground was no ordinary phenomenon. There was something lurking deep within this blackened earth!
Little Red's pupils shrank—it was just a guess he dared not speak aloud. Why was the Heavenly River within the Heavenly Gate upside down?
He had always observed the surface because he lacked his elder brothers' ability to see through the essence of things.
Just like when he first saw that ancient grand formation, he could only think of the Four Immortal Mountains overseas, unlike his brothers, who were already contemplating how to break the formation.
Lost in thought, he suddenly felt a gaze from afar. His entire body shivered—it was Brother Xun looking at him.
In midair, Chen Xun retracted his gaze and murmured,
“The Heart Demon Tribulation does offer some insights. For instance, some of its seemingly logical deductions. Little Red’s absence… it seems his lifespan had already come to an end.”
His expression turned unreadable as he pulled out another notebook and began writing plans for contingencies. If replacing blood to defy fate and extend life was impossible, then another path must be taken.
At the bottom of the Tian Duan Plains, there was a sealed three-eyed creature. The stones there seemed capable of halting the flow of life force. Regardless of the outcome, he had to try.
Even if Little Red’s departure was inevitable, they would have no regrets—the journey always mattered more than the destination.
Chen Xun waved his hand lightly, and an intimidating plan materialized in his notebook. His brothers’ future should be paved by their eldest brother, who would bear all hardships for them.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
In the far distance, scorching meteors descended from the heavens, slicing through the darkness and crashing onto the blackened earth. Crimson light illuminated the land, as violent waves of five elemental forces swept across the area.
The anguished screams of the corrupted beings echoed from afar, their chilling aura surging like a tide toward Chen Xun’s divine sense.
For the first time, these corrupted beings felt the weight of despair. Why hadn’t that being’s lifespan ended yet? What was this monstrosity?!
Chen Xun’s cold, electric gaze rippled through his eyes as he continued to write in the air, unperturbed.
By the shore.
Big black ox and Little Red locked eyes, their expressions frozen in awe.
“Big Brother... truly incredible!”
Two roaring voices resounded in their hearts, though they didn’t dare say it aloud. That black-robed figure was too powerful, too reliable.
For an entire month, Chen Xun wrote countless words and destroyed many notebooks.
“Old Ox.”
“Moo moo!”
The big black ox transformed into a streak of light and instantly appeared before Chen Xun, affectionately nudging him with its head. Its eyes radiated honest simplicity, devoid of deceit.
Chen Xun burst into laughter and gave the big black ox a hearty slap on its hide, finding the sensation immensely satisfying.
He pulled out a notebook, his expression serious.
“Old Ox, this contains all the preparation methods for the Heart Demon Tribulation. This trial is extremely perilous; even your original willpower may succumb to it.”
“Moo?”
The big black ox froze in surprise but solemnly accepted the notebook, flipping through its pages.
“Moo moo~~”
Shock filled its heart. Big Brother had written so much, yet one point stood out above all else: believe this is reality. Believe in what your heart has always trusted—and hold that belief unwaveringly!
Big black ox’s eyes quivered. What exactly had Chen Xun experienced during his Heart Demon Tribulation? While not a word of it was mentioned, every stroke and character emanated his painstaking effort.
“Old Ox, the cycle of reincarnation exists, but the present matters most. Our present is the culmination of countless lifetimes. Dreams may last for millennia, but only we endure, as the singular, true self!”
Chen Xun spoke each word with conviction, his voice resonating powerfully.
“No matter what you face in the Heart Demon illusion, I’ll be here waiting. The road ahead is still long.”
Big black ox slowly raised his head, meeting Chen Xun’s gaze. His nostrils flared heavily, exhaling with determination.
“Old Ox, get out of here and face your tribulation far away! Find a place full of corrupted beings and blast them to pieces!”
Chen Xun’s tone suddenly shifted, his presence surging with dominance. The heavens churned as torrents of energy rushed forth.
“Don’t feel pressured. Even if you fail, your Big Brother can protect you for a lifetime!”
His commanding voice echoed for thousands of miles, majestic and vast. For the first time in eons, the corrupted beings on the other side instinctively stepped back, a flicker of dread sparking in their ageless hearts.
