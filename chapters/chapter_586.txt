"It's been only a few years since we last met, yet you've already broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm. That's pretty fast."
Zhong Qian raised his head slightly and glanced at the cold man in golden armor before replying, "Thanks to your guidance, Senior, I seized the opportunity to establish my Dao foundation in Converging Sea. Afterward, I inquired about your whereabouts and traveled all the way here."
His implication was clear—breaking through to Foundation Establishment Realm hadn't taken him the three or four years one might expect. In fact, he had likely succeeded in just one or two years, leaving him ample time to journey here at his own pace.
Li Xuanfeng, recognizing that Zhong Qian's cultivation speed was exceptional, nodded slightly and motioned for him to continue.
Zhong Qian paused for a moment, then spoke softly, "Senior's kindness has been engraved in my heart but I'm still unable to repay it yet. There's nothing of value in my hands, except for the news of a cave dwelling, which I wish to offer to you, Senior."
He must be referring to the Green Pine Temple...
Li Xuanfeng listened attentively. Knowing that Zhong Qian bore a thread of fate, Li Xuanfeng didn't believe the young man for even a second when he claimed he had no valuable treasures on him.
Since he's offering information about this cave dwelling... I can't simply abandon him and explore it alone… He's quite a shrewd one.
Had Li Xuanfeng not known about Zhong Qian bearing a thread of fate, he might have felt grateful for the offer, perhaps even sending Li Qinghong or Li Yuanjiao along with him to explore it.
Zhong Qian would have killed two birds with one stone—not just repaying a favor to Li Xuanfeng but also earning a companion to explore the cave with him.
But now, with his deeper knowledge, Li Xuanfeng merely asked, "Which cave dwelling are you talking about?"
"The Green Pine Temple Ruins… on Green Pine Island!" Zhong Qian answered, stressing the words as if fearing Li Xuanfeng wouldn't grasp the significance of the site.
"Green Pine Temple is an ancient immortal gate, and the site is now a grotto heaven. Junior has a way to enter it but will need a few people's help!"
"Green Pine Temple?" Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, feigning surprise.
"That's a grotto heaven we're talking about! Several immortal sects have fought over it for years. As far as I know, the Sword Gate is constantly at odds with Chunyi Dao Gate and Crimson Reef Island because of it... Yet you're telling me you know a way to enter it? Are you sure it will work?" he asked.
Zhong Qian froze, seemingly realizing only then how famous the Green Pine Temple was.
"Well, I acquired the method from a devil cultivator... It's written in great detail, and I've studied it carefully for quite some time now. There should be no problem. There are also specific requirements for those setting up the formation… They need to be cultivators who have mastered Grade Four or Five cultivation techniques that are mystical enough..." he answered meekly.
"I'm just a rogue cultivator born in the Eastern Sea but I'm fortunate to know two friends from immortal gates who can join us... One of them is from the Purple Smoke Gate, while the other is from Great Xiukui Temple," he added.
After hearing the general gist of Zhong Qian's explanation, Li Xuanfeng coldly laughed to himself.
Those Daoist Masters had really arranged everything carefully. They must have really feared that the opportunity inside those ruins might be snatched away by others, going to such lengths as to set up multiple requirements... I'm guessing that all of them are just cover-ups to make it easier for those bearing a thread of fate to enter that place…
Despite his inner thoughts, Li Xuanfeng nodded and politely replied, "Well, you've come at a great time. I happen to be seeking a few cultivation techniques within grotto heavens. Thank you for your help."
"No thanks needed. We are the fortunate ones to have you joining us," Zhong Qian responded eagerly, his joy evident.
Having someone as formidable as Li Xuanfeng joining his group immediately put Zhong Qian at ease. He quickly added, "I've heard that this method is known to others as well, so there will be competition within the grotto heaven... I'll be relying on your help when the time comes, Senior."
This piece of information was likely passed on to Zhong Qian by those in the immortal sect, so he was reminding Li Xuanfeng to be fully prepared.
Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly in acknowledgment, and then the young man continued, "I will come to find Senior in three months. By then, the other two from the immortal gates will also be joining us. Please use this time to prepare yourself, Senior."
After a few more polite exchanges, Zhong Qian made his exit. Li Yuanjiao entered the cave dwelling right after him, and Li Xuanfeng said, "There are still three months left. We can retrieve the dharma artifact and test it out."
Li Yuanjiao nodded, though with some hesitation, and spoke softly, "The grotto heaven is dangerous, we might not be able to return. Finding the entrance would be ideal, but I'm afraid it won't be possible for us to bring the mirror inside. If something were to happen to it inside... it could lead to trouble."
Li Xuanfeng nodded and replied, "You're right. We'll just bring it out to give it a try, but finding that entrance is our best bet."
Li Yuanjiao took to the wind and left, while Li Xuanfeng fell into a deep thoughtful silence.
Daoist Master Yuan Su... is he really giving me an opportunity? Can we really kill Yu Muxian?
He recalled Daoist Master Yuan Su's words that day. They seemed to suggest that there would be no consequences for killing Yu Muxian, but the real meaning behind those words was unclear. Was it a hint or a warning?
Li Xuanfeng tightened his grip on the golden bow. Yu Muxian had been hiding himself on the peak day after day, cultivating in seclusion, never making a move. It had become increasingly difficult for Li Xuanfeng to gauge the man's strength.
He closed his eyes slowly, sinking his thoughts into the golden bow. Within it, a sea of golden light and astral light glowed brightly—thick, sharp, and brimming with immeasurable power.
"This arrow intent... I'm afraid I'll have to use it soon," he murmured.
Li Xuanfeng had sealed an arrow intent within his golden bow. Over the decades, it had been honed and refined, day after day, until its power surpassed even his own comprehension.
When he was young, he had told Li Tongya about this not long after this dharma artifact was forged. No one else knew about it. With Li Tongya's death, this secret remained buried. Now, he was the only one who knew about it.
He exhaled softly and quietly resumed his cultivation.
Yuanwu Peak, Mount Azure Pond.
Yuanwu Peak towered above the clouds, shrouded by mist and blessed with surging fiery veins. It was the Azure Pond's dedicated immortal peak for weapon refinement, where cultivators could be seen coming and going all the time.
A white jade pavilion stood at its summit, shrouded in mist as well. Spiritual energy was thick in the air, and the sound of flowing spring water could be heard. A middle-aged man sat cross-legged on the jade platform, meditating in silence and radiating an ethereal aura.
His long hair cascaded freely over his shoulders and he wore a jade buckle as his pendant around his neck. As he performed hand seals with his two fingers, sounds of clashing metals could be heard. It was as though there were gold and iron within his body, colliding against each other incessantly.
As the clouds drifted away, a teenage girl dressed in white approached him, her movements graceful and serene. She kneeled and bowed respectfully to the man and gently informed, "Master, the Daoist Master is calling for you."
The man slowly opened his eyes, mana light glowing at the center of his brow.
"Qingyi, did he tell you the agenda?" he asked.
"No."
The woman, Fei Qingyi, was a member of the Fei Family, now in the late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm. Since she was a disciple of Yuanwu Peak, her attire was of high quality.
She hesitated before continuing, "I wasn't informed of the agenda but based on the recent rumors, it may be related to the Green Pine Temple."
The man was none other than Yu Muxian. Having secluded himself for many years, his cultivation had grown ever more profound. He exhaled lightly, rose gracefully to his feet, and rode the wind, making his way up the mountain.
As he passed other cultivators, they cupped their fists in respect and called out, "Greetings, Daoist!"
