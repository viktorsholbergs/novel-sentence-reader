"Fine," Li Yuanjiao said as he smiled and nodded, then stepped to the side.
Li Qinghong had been cultivating in seclusion for a long time. This was an opportunity for her to stretch and loosen her muscles.
Her face broke into a grin as she advanced, drawing her weapon. With practiced grace, she spun the spear that was radiating with a purple glow. Although she had fought many battles in the lake, she did not immediately unleash her thunder. Instead, she slowly approached the catfish demon.
Thunder technique worked differently compared to sword qi, which was the sharp qi derived from the metal element. Sword qi harmonized well with water, so it could work well under water.
On the other hand, thunder techniques were characterized by attributes of thunder and fire, as well as the dynamic balance of yin and yang, where the yang manifested as lightning. Naturally, it was less effective when released in water compared to on land. Yet, it was still formidable enough for Li Qinghong to deal with a minor demon.
Li Qinghong activated the River Crossing Torrential Step, then lunged, targeting the demon's underbelly with her spear.
The White Iris Spear was deadly, so she would not use it to deal with a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm demon. The dharma weapon in her hand was instead a low-grade Qi Cultivation Realm spear.
Poof!
Li Yuanjiao had barely registered a tingling sensation on his face when a bright light suddenly flashed, followed by the muffled sounds of an explosion. Water churned into froth and mud.
The catfish demon, caught off-guard, winced and recoiled. The spell it had been gathering in its mouth dispersed as it staggered backward, its whiskers stretched taut, emitting a piercing screech.
Li Qinghong pressed on now that she had gained her advantage. Her spear movements were swift and precise, killing the fish and prawns in the water and causing them to surface. The catfish demon, clearly outmatched, turned in panic and fled.
Li Yuanjiao, observing the scene before him, could not help but express his admiration.
"Thunder techniques are truly impressive! It's rare in Jiangnan… If it didn't shorten lifespans and harm the body, it would have been the most formidable offensive technique in our family," he remarked.
If their family had not acquired the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual recently, nothing could truly rival this Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique. Though the former was a Grade Four technique, brilliant and powerful as the sun, it might still fall short of the intimidating power of the thunder technique, which could overwhelm both the enemy and the wielder alike.
With that in mind, Li Yuanjiao recalled something else.
Xicheng has made remarkable strides in the past few years… He celebrated his twenty-sixth birthday just a few days ago with a breakthrough to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Meanwhile, Uncle Donghe hasn't returned from the western desert…
Chen Donghe was expected to return in a year or two and likely be around when Li Xicheng entered the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, Ximing who was studying alchemy with the Xiao Family, and Xijun who was training on Meiche Peak showed remarkable talent. They were already close to reaching Li Xicheng's level.
Ximing and Xijun have already reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at just fourteen and fifteen… It seems likely they'll advance to the Qi Cultivation Realm within the next five to seven years. If the Golden Yang Radiant Origin is bestowed upon Xicheng, then at least one of them won't be able to receive this spiritual qi in time for their breakthrough.
With the devil plague rampant across the land and communication from the west sporadic, gathering a portion of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin spiritual qi within the next seven years posed a significant challenge to them.
I better discuss this with Xicheng once I return!
By the time he regained his composure, Li Qinghong was already returning, dragging along a large catfish behind her. The fish's body, marked with patches of black and white, was now rigid, with its cultivation sealed. Foam bubbled from its gaping mouth.
This demonic creature, struck by lightning and slightly charred, had regurgitated all sorts of things—bits of fish, ducks, crabs, snakes, along with some fabric and driftwood… It also seemed like some of the fishermen on the lake had fallen prey to it before.
"Hm."
Li Yuanjiao cast a glance at it before performing a hand seal to deactivate the isolating barrier. The formation plate on the ground slowly floated up, settling gently onto his hand.
"This Muddy Water Talisman Flowing Formation is quite useful and extremely isolating… As long as the formation plate is guarded, it can reliably trap enemies," Li Qinghong commented thoughtfully.
Li Yuanjiao put the plate away, then remarked, "It's a solid water-based formation, though regrettably only available for rent. Purchasing it would set us back over a hundred Spirit Stones."
Li Qinghong was in a good mood, conversing with her brother as she channeled mana to her hands to lift the catfish demon that was the size of a small hut. The two of them then flew side by side back to the mountain.
Meanwhile, Li Yuanping had already finished preparing for the ceremony. Dressed in a Daoist robe, he waited with the old monkey who was also dressed in a Daoist robe and a pair of clogs. Standing beside them was Li Ximing, who seemed to have just returned not long ago and was ready to join the family rituals.
Upon seeing his elder siblings return with the demonic beast, Li Yuanping praised them and produced a wooden box from his sleeve joyfully.
"Big Brother! The Wanglin Blossom has bloomed!" he exclaimed in excitement.
He opened the wooden box to reveal three slightly reddish spirit flowers, each delicate and soft, about the size of a palm, with slender stamens and five bicolored petals—red on top and white beneath.
As soon as the wooden box was opened, everyone, including Li Yuanping himself, smiled at the sight of it. Li Yuanping explained, "This flower makes the heart light and joyful. Whether mortal or cultivator, unless they've formed their Immortal Foundation, they can't help but show a true smile."
The wooden box had just been opened, but Li Yuanping and everyone else laughed muffledly, with the corners of their mouths upturned.
"The owner of this flower is happy, smiles when he sees it, and is very gentle… No matter whether he is a mortal or a monk, as long as he had not become an immortal, he must smile honestly." Li Yuanping finished with a warm, genuine smile.
After admiring the flowers for a moment, Li Yuanjiao instructed, "Give two of these to Ximing and have him deliver them to Ancestor Yuansi as a modest gift, a token of our gratitude for his long-standing support."
After giving the instructions, Li Yuanjiao rewarded the old monkey with some cultivation resources which the monkey accepted with a grateful nod.
Li Ximing then came forward.
"Thank you, Second Uncle!"
Li Ximing was gentle and respectful. Having trained with the Xiao Family for two years, Master Xiao Yuansi had taught him everything he knew. Li Ximing had studied numerous medicinal texts and had become proficient in gathering and identifying herbs, reflecting some of Master Xiao's refined demeanor.
He had grown taller and his features had become more distinct, bearing a strong resemblance to Li Yuanping, though less delicate in appearance and not as handsome. However, his temperament compensated for his plain looks.
The aura at Xianyou Peak was rich, and his cultivation had been progressing well. He was not far behind Li Xijun, who was also focused on advancing his cultivation. Li Yuanjiao noticed a hint of concern in his eyebrows and said, "If there are any difficulties, feel free to speak up."
Li Ximing hesitated for a moment before gesturing to a few medicine pouches on his waist and replied, "Master Xiao gifted me an old set of medicine pouches to store spirit items. I accepted it in the end, so I fear our family is further indebted to him…"
Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding. The family had already stretched its resources thin by giving Li Qingxiao seventy Spirit Stones.
"Our family currently lacks additional resources; we only have a few dharma artifacts left in our treasury. Does Senior Yuansi have any children? What is their level of cultivation?" Li Yuanjiao asked.
With a look of guilt, Li Ximing answered, "The ancestor's children were not strong in their cultivation and died in a conflict. There's a descendant in their family named Xiao Guixiang who comes from a well-off family that doesn't lack dharma weapons nor elixirs."
Li Yuanjiao sighed and gritted his teeth in frustration, mentally noting this information.
We shouldn't delay this any longer… If there's little chance of resolving this, it might be best to offer the alchemy legacy from our family.
He waved dismissively and said, "Now that you're back, let's prepare for the ritual."
