Halfway up the mountain, the temple in front was clean and tidy, but the apricot-yellow courtyard walls and the gray-blue temple roof looked ancient at first glance.
The monk, with white eyebrows and a long beard, had a kind face and a serene aura. With his hands clasped together, he stood quietly in front of the temple, exuding an air of purity.
His gaze focused on the distance, directly on the three figures walking up from the base of the mountain.
The monk smiled softly and said, "Where do you three patrons come from?"
His voice carried for miles without sounding harsh, and in the blink of an eye, Chen Xun and his companions appeared before the temple.
"From the mountains and seas, passing by this place with questions in our hearts. We have come to trouble you for a moment." Chen Xun's expression was calm as he met the monk's eyes. "I hope the monk doesn't mind."
"Moo~" The big black ox slightly lowered its head in greeting.
Little Red hid on the ox's back, its eyes cautiously scanning the surroundings, with a faint glow buried underground. Unlike his two older brothers, it had no faith in the Buddha and didn’t believe in the heavens. If there was danger or deception, at least it could alert them in time.
"Please, ask," the monk said calmly, without probing their cultivation at all.
"Monk, why does this temple have no Buddha statues?" Chen Xun furrowed his brow, glanced at the big black ox, and said with conviction, "How are we supposed to offer incense money?"
The big black ox quickly nodded in agreement. Whenever they encountered a temple, they would make a small offering and record the Buddha's name.
Little Red twitched at the corner of its mouth. Over the past year, it had witnessed firsthand how frugal Chen Xun could be. Yet he was never stingy when donating spirit stones to temples.
It had never heard them explain why and dared not ask, but trusted its elder brothers had their reasons.
"Moo!" The big black ox snorted heavily. Its elder brother was always right; after all, they weren’t lacking spirit stones.
If fate brought them to a temple and there was no Buddha statue or opportunity to donate spirit stones, wouldn't that disrupt their path to enlightenment?!
For a moment, the monk was silent, his white beard trembling slightly. What a startling perspective.
"Patron, you do not have the spiritual roots of a Buddha; you are on the path of Dao. Why do you seek the Buddha?" the monk countered, not answering Chen Xun’s question, but posing one of his own. "It seems your heart is not filled with doubt, but rather with attachment."
Whoa, a true master!
Chen Xun's pupils shrank slightly. In just two sentences, the monk had seen through him completely, even stirring the deepest disbelief he harbored.
"Moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, confused by the monk's words. What did having or lacking spiritual roots have to do with seeking the Buddha?
Little Red's ears twitched, uninterested in the monk’s words. It was too busy monitoring the other five monks in the temple, analyzing their behavior and danger levels.
"Monk, let’s get straight to the point."
Chen Xun's demeanor grew serious, his aura becoming deeper as if his face had changed. "We seek the Buddha for one reason only—merit!"
"Moo~!" The big black ox's eyes shone with conviction, as it firmly believed in the power of merit.
However, along their journey, no monk had ever provided a clear explanation. All they ever said was, "Donate spirit stones, and our Buddha will bless you with merit."
But that wasn’t the answer they were looking for. They didn’t need merit to protect themselves.
"Heh, it seems some of the monks are eavesdropping from the back courtyard," Little Red chuckled to itself, taking a small step backwards. "I’ll have to tell Brother Xun about this later."
While the two men and the ox were engaged in their exchange, no one noticed the little lion beneath the ox’s belly, worrying itself sick for their sake.
"Patron, what do you believe merit to be, and why seek it in a temple?"
"Doing good, upholding justice brings merit."
"Patron, that is merely upholding worldly justice, not merit."
"We have given away all our wealth, performed funerals, and held ceremonies for the common folk in our village and beyond!"
"Giving without seeking reward, acting without seeking fame—this is virtue, not merit."
The monk shook his head lightly, his demeanor calm as clouds, "It is not merit."
Chen Xun furrowed his brows, a vein pulsing on his forehead. His tone became increasingly urgent, "We’ve donated copper coins and spirit stones to many temples, and their Buddhas promised merit!"
The big black ox instinctively pressed closer to Chen Xun, its breath coming out in light, anxious snorts.
"Merit is not a concept originating from our Great Li Realm Buddhism. Surely you already know the answer by now, Patron."
The monk bowed slightly, his demeanor transcendent. "Buddha does not reside in temples, Patron. You have become attached to form."
A light autumn wind stirred, carrying the rustling sound of fallen leaves, while the desolate, ancient temple stirred a few wisps of directionless wind.
Suddenly, the world fell silent, except for the sound of the wind.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood frozen, their eyes empty, silent for a long time, while the monk stood calmly before them, serene as ever.
Little Red looked around nervously, feeling the atmosphere had suddenly become quite unsettling!
"Hmph, impossible!" Chen Xun let out a cold laugh, firmly gripping the big black ox’s head. "We’ve cultivated for many years; we won’t waver because of a few words."
"Moo!!" The big black ox roared, lifting its head slightly.
"Of course, those were just the humble thoughts of this old monk. Pay them no mind."
The monk’s patience was remarkable, and he did not argue back. "But from what I see, merit is not truly your attachment, is it?"
Chen Xun took a deep breath, and the big black ox turned to look at him, eyes full of hope.
After all, ever since they had left their small village, the idea of merit had dominated their lives. Their attachment ran deeper than anything else.
Chen Xun had initially said it to comfort the big black ox, but as time passed, he started to believe it himself. Over the course of two thousand years, it had become his own belief.
For no other reason than the hope that their departed friends could truly reincarnate thanks to their merit and live a life without regret.
"Monk, I apologize for my earlier outburst. I was too harsh," Chen Xun said, his gaze calming as he cupped his hands in apology. "Merit is very important to us."
"Moo~" The big black ox also lowered its head in apology for the earlier shout.
The monk nodded, bowing slightly in return, "You are both polite patrons. This old monk meant no harm to your path."
"Monk, please enlighten us: what is true merit?"
"The good deeds you have done are indeed virtuous, but there is still a long way to go before they become merit." The monk stood tall, his robe worn but his eyes bright with wisdom. "Merit is the cultivation of oneself, the unity of heart and actions. That is merit."
"In the Great Li Realm cultivation world, Daoists, Confucians, and Buddhists all have their paths, and they all speak of merit."
"Indeed."
Chen Xun’s gaze deepened. In his homeland, the Qian Nation’s cultivation world, there was no such concept.
The big black ox’s eyes widened. It had always thought merit was exclusive to Buddhism!
