In the great hall, the candlelight flickered. Li Yuanxiu stood to the side at the highest seat with an envoy from Mount Yue kneeling below him, his head pressed firmly against the ground.
He spoke with respect, "My humble self greets the Young Family Head! Our king remembers the friendship between our two families and often speaks of the health of my aunt and uncle, and recalls the alliance between our two families… He has sent many products from our region. Currently, the position of queen remains vacant, and the king still hopes to marry a daughter from the Li Family…"
Li Yuanxiu stepped forward and descended two steps from his elevated position. The clan soldiers on both sides immediately focused their attention on this envoy from Mount Yue.
Chen Donghe, who was standing below the steps, also went on high alert, ready for any sudden movements from the visitor.
"Our Li Family is located in the east and has only heard of the upheavals in Mount Yue. Mu Jiaoman's side branches have all perished without survivors… With the envoy coming from afar, can you enlighten me on this matter?"
Li Yuanxiu did not respond to the envoy's initial address, instead bringing up the details of the unrest in Mount Yue. This caused the envoy to stammer and sweat profusely.
The current king of Mount Yue, Qimu, although following Mu Jiaoman's orders to kill his brothers, had such an excuse often doubted within his own territory. Naturally, that excuse alone was not sufficient to convince Li Yuanxiu.
The envoy could only shakily say, "There was unrest… it resulted in the death of the previous king's heirs, and a change in kingship is inevitable... it wasn't our king's intention. He made sure to protect the mother queen, which was indeed meritorious!"
The 'mother queen' naturally referred to the woman from the Li Family who had been married off there. Mu Jiaoman, while keeping the woman in his palace, acted cautiously, never allowing her to bear children. Her status in the palace was quite unique, and during the turmoil, forces from all sides sent protection for her immediately.
Li Yuanxiu listened but made no response. Observing the Mount Yue envoy trembling before him, he contemplated to himself quietly.
Before Shamoli breaks through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, we should pacify Qimu to prevent him from becoming suspicious and seek help elsewhere, potentially causing trouble. Everything should remain as usual, making him feel at ease.
Tributes and trade are easy to agree upon; it's just a matter of issuing another order. However, if a daughter of our clan were to marry over there… wouldn't she become a widow within a few years? There are many daughters in the minor clans right now, but several clan uncles and elders will inevitably make a fuss.
The envoy from Mount Yue, not understanding the situation, thought Li Yuanxiu was angry and trembled like a leaf. His sweat was pooling on the stone floor, almost forming a small puddle.
Li Yuanxiu then spoke up, breaking the silence softly.
"Mount Yue wishes to continue the marital alliance with our family, and we, the Li Family, also agree. Matters of tributes and trade will follow the old practices; there is no need for changes."
"Thank you, great king! Thank you, great king!"
The envoy bowed deeply several times in relief, blurting out his thanks, calling Li Yuanxiu a "great king". Li Yuanxiu raised his hand slightly, smiling warmly.
"However… our family does not have many daughters to marry off as of now. They hold significant status within the clan, so we can't simply arrange a marriage… Besides, my father is currently cultivating in seclusion. I, the Young Family Head, am not easy to persuade like my father. There is one condition for this marital alliance with Mount Yue."
"Do tell, great king," the envoy quickly said, to which Li Yuanxiu, still smiling, replied, "How could my family's daughter marry into the West without land to showcase her prestige? To the west of Eastern Mount Yue, there are several villages. Let Qimu conquer a few villages to the west as a celebration gift for our daughter's wedding."
"T-That's..."
Caught off guard by Li Yuanxiu's demand, the Mount Yue envoy momentarily froze, knowing well that granting lands to a daughter who would wield no real power upon marrying out merely meant extra tax revenue from those lands.
He could only respond, "Would it be possible to grant a land or two from the various villages of Eastern Mount Yue? Our king is not stingy! The region is unstable, and it might not be advisable to mobilize troops rashly..."
Li Yuanxiu frowned and, cutting him off mid-sentence with a commanding tone, challenged, "Is this truly the extent of your king's sincerity?!"
As Mount Yue was in a position of weakness and reliant on the Li Family for survival, the envoy, naturally becoming submissive, panicked under Li Yuanxiu's intimidation and started begging for mercy.
"This lowly one will report back to the king immediately! A response will be provided within a few days... please, forgive me, Young Family Head!"
"You're dismissed."
Li Yuanxiu simply waved his hand, and the envoy hurriedly retreated.
Then, a clan soldier brought forward another person dressed in Mount Yue attire who kneeled and cupped his fist instead as he greeted, "Young Family Head!"
"What news does my clan sister bring?" Li Yuanxiu asked, lifting his head.
The messenger from Mount Yue then pulled a thick stack of documents from his chest pocket and replied respectfully, "The Queen Mother has recorded all the arrangements Qimu made upon ascending to power, along with the distribution and locations of Mount Yue cultivators within the state here."
Li Pingyi stepped forward to receive the book, and Li Yuanxiu nodded with a smile. He then said softly, "Tell my clan sister when you return to first excel in her role as Queen Mother, and within these few years, we'll find a way for her to reunite with her family."
"Understood."
The man bowed in gratitude and withdrew.
Li Yuanxiu then took the stack of documents from the approaching Li Pingyi, spread them out, and began to read. He muttered to himself, "Three at the early stage of Qi Cultivation Realm… one at the mid-stage… all are cultivators with unrefined qi. Mount Yue is indeed too weak; no wonder Qimu was able to stabilize the state in one fell swoop. He couldn't afford to wait and has come to affiliate himself."
As Li Yuanxiu read on, Li Yuanjiao was already standing in the courtyard. He glanced at the Mount Yue messenger. Once the messenger had exited the courtyard, Li Yuanjiao spoke, "Although our clan sister is from the minor sect, she's no easy mark. Mu Jiaoman was wary of her while alive, yet she quickly garnered support after his death and meticulously gathered information, placing people within the trade caravans that were returning home, which is no small feat."
"Hmm."
Li Yuanxiu simply nodded, continuing to read the letter before responding, "When selecting a daughter from the minor clan to go west that year, she was chosen with great care, and her entourage was loyal. When she returns, we must acknowledge her and her group's contributions."
The Li Family's marriages were certainly more strategic than when Mu Yalu had come over alone in her time. Not only could the clan daughter return home annually, but she could also bring many loyal attendants along with her.
After listening to his brother's explanation, Li Yuanjiao nodded in agreement.
"Brother, Shamoli has already broken through the fifth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm and has been persuaded by me to go into seclusion… The spirit fruits have also been delivered to him. With these aids, he should attempt to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm within two years."
"Good!" Li Yuanxiu commended as he nodded. He pondered for a moment, then softly added, "I'll also personally go up the mountain to make sure that our family is prepared with a portion of unrefined qi."
