The Red and Blue Kobudai Meeting
* * *
That evening.
Many Kobudai warriors were gathered in the central plaza of the Red Kobu Tribe village, illuminated by red luminous magic ore, like bonfires.
Their body colors were red and some blue.
In other words, the Red Kobu Tribe and the Blue Kobu Tribe… the meeting proposed by Kobdacleva had come to fruition.
But of course, if all the Kobudai participated in the talks, it would be impossible to reach a conclusion.
Therefore, the ones representing the Red Kobu Tribe at the meeting, in addition to the young Clan Chief Kobdalian, are the “Ten Warriors of the Red Kobu”.
The “Ten Warriors of the Red Kobu”, consisting of Kobudai of various ages, from young Kobudai like Kobdaroze to veteran Kobudai like Kobdaold, are elite warriors who lead other warriors in battle, but in peacetime, they also assist the Clan Chief and help run the village.
On the other hand, representing the Blue Kobu Tribe at the meeting are Kobudai led by Clan Chief Kobdacleva, called the “Seven Sages of the Blue Kobu”.
Unlike the “Ten Warriors of the Red Kobu”, they seem to be a group of civilian officials who don’t necessarily also serve as warriors.
Most of them have slender bodies.
(I wonder if I could take on three of them and win…)
While the representatives of the Red and Blue Kobu Tribes were sitting in a circle around the red luminous magic ore, exchanging greetings before the meeting… Kobdaroze was analyzing their fighting strength, looking at the “Seven Sages of the Blue Kobu”.
But even so, they’re not to be taken lightly.
An unmistakable intelligence dwelled in their eyes, and Kobdaroze quickly realized that they were warriors who fought in a different way than him.
<<<Now then, in response to the request of ‘Kobdacleva, the Wise’, the Clan Chief of the Blue Kobu Tribe, we will hold a meeting of representatives from both the Red Kobu Tribe and the Blue Kobu Tribe. The host is me, ‘Kobdalian of the Raging Flames’, the Clan Chief of the Red Kobu Tribe! Any objections!?>>>
<<<None!>>>
<<<No objections!>>>
The two-tribe meeting began with Kobdalian’s electrifying shout, and the voices of the warriors and sages responding to him.
* * *
<<<Wh-What!? The fry… were kidnapped!?>>>
And this meeting, right from the start, was thrown into chaos by the report from the Blue Kobu Tribe.
<<<Ridiculous… The Black Kobu… are they seriously doing such a thing…? >>>
<<<I-I can’t believe it!!>>>
The Red Kobu warriors were confused, shouting one after another.
<<<It’s understandable that you can’t believe it… but this is the truth. The Black Kobu Tribe kidnapped our precious village fry, turned them into hostages… and are demanding our subservience.>>>
Kobdacleva said that in a heavy voice, letting out a deep sigh, looking at the Red Kobu warriors.
<<<…!!>>>
The Red Kobu warriors… trembled, their large bodies shaking, horrified by the atrocity committed by the Black Kobu Tribe.
To Kobudai, fry (juveniles), are treasures.
So, even if they’re fry from another tribe… they would never lay a hand on them.
That’s the Kobudai law that has been passed down for generations.
It’s no exaggeration to say that it’s a law ingrained in them at an instinctual level.
That taboo…
…The Black Kobu Tribe… broke it.
<<<But you’re not going to accept their demands… is that right?>>>
Clan Chief Kobdalian, speaking on behalf of the speechless Red Kobu warriors, asked the Blue Kobu Tribe.
<<<Of course.>>>
Kobdacleva nodded, his eyes glinting dangerously.
<<<Knowing the despicable, dishonorable Black Kobu Tribe… this is nothing more than a ploy to trap us. Even if we obediently follow their words, we can’t expect the fry to return to the village safely.>>>
<<<So you’re seeking an alliance with us? To crush the Black Kobu Tribe together?>>>
<<<Indeed. I appreciate you getting to the point, Kobdalian-dono. That’s exactly right.>>>
<<<Ooh… A two-tribe alliance!>>>
<<<The Red Kobu of strength, and the Blue Kobu of wisdom… Two of the three major Kobudai tribes, excluding the Black Kobu Tribe, joining fins…>>>
<<<But would our ancestors allow such a thing?>>>
<<<Is it in our best interest?>>>
Hearing this conversation between the Clan Chiefs, the warriors gathered here were divided on whether to agree or disagree.
Even though it’s not as severe as with the Black Kobu Tribe… the Red Kobu Tribe also has a history of fighting and competing for territory with the Blue Kobu Tribe…
And although the Black Kobu Tribe’s atrocious act of kidnapping the fry is unforgivable, it was the Blue Kobu Tribe that was victimized, not the Red Kobu Tribe.
Cooperating with them… wouldn’t that be playing into the Blue Kobu Tribe’s hands, and the Red Kobu Tribe being used?
The Red Kobu Tribe also has its pride, and even though they hate the Black Kobu, this alliance isn’t something they can easily agree to.
Kobdacleva must have understood the feelings of the Red Kobu warriors.
So, here, he provided them with another important piece of information.
<<<And that’s not the only taboo the Black Kobu Tribe broke. They’re trying to… excavate… the ‘Calamity’.>>>
<<<What!?>>>
The Red Kobu warriors exclaimed in unison.
Kobdacleva closed his eyes and sighed.
<<<Send scouts to the forbidden grounds in the valley behind their village. The Calamity excavation is already quite advanced.>>>
<<<No way… No way!? >>>
<<<Those bastards, are they trying to destroy the world!? >>>
<<<What an act of folly…!>>>
The veteran Red Kobu warriors were panicked, exclaiming in astonishment.
<<<Excavating the Calamity…? What are they thinking? Could it be that the Black Kobu… know how to control the Calamity at will? >>>
Even Kobdalian was taken aback by this information.
Trembling, he asked Kobdacleva.
<<<I don’t know that much. But they are trying to awaken the Calamity, that’s a fact. Whether they can control it or not, it’s the same for us… In other words, all that awaits us in the future is destruction.>>>
<<<…>>>
Silence filled the central plaza, the site of the meeting.
The only thing moving was the fog, illuminated by the red luminous magic ore, swaying in the wind.
Now, I need to explain something here.
What is this ‘Calamity’ that the Kobudai are talking about?
It’s a monster that appears in the myths passed down by all the Kobudai tribes.
Once upon a time, this world experienced a global catastrophe called the “Day of Ruin”.
This Calamity is apparently a monster that was unleashed on the “Day of Ruin”.
Its name is ‘Humidafai, the Fog Bringer’.
According to Kobudai mythology, the fog of this Eserem Sea of Fog is produced by that monster.
Its exact appearance isn’t passed down, but it’s said to be a giant something with the hardest shell in the world, an existence devoid of reason, ruled by a bottomless appetite.
This Calamity rampaged until it was sealed deep underground in the forbidden grounds at the back of the Black Kobu Tribe’s territory by the outer god, ‘Sealing God’… and it’s said that it devoured all living things in the eastern half of this ‘Continent’, how terrifying.
And why does Godkob, the god of the Kobudai, continue to swim eternally in the Eserem Sea of Fog?
It’s to keep watch over this Calamity and be prepared for its revival.
Therefore, all the Flying Kobudai clans, who are descendants and believers of Godkob, must also be prepared.
They must train their bodies, hone their skills, and if, by any chance, the seal on the Calamity is broken, they must become the vanguard of Godkob and challenge this Calamity.
This is the outline of the myth passed down by the Kobudai.
Therefore, it’s unthinkable.
Something that must never be done.
To awaken the Calamity… themselves…
<<<Send out scouts immediately. Confirm the facts at sunrise tomorrow.>>>
There’s no time to waste arguing.
Kobdalian decided that.
<<<And as soon as we confirm the Blue Kobu Tribe’s claims… we’ll move… We’ll attack the Black Kobu Tribe with our entire army!! >>>
<<<Hah!!>>>
At Kobdalian’s command, the Red Kobu warriors began their preparations for battle.
The quiet village suddenly became bustling.
<<<Kobdacleva-dono, the Blue Kobu Tribe will…? >>>
<<<Of course, we’ll send out our entire army too. This is a crisis for all Kobudai. Let’s set aside our past conflicts.>>>
Kobdacleva nodded at Kobdalian’s question, and answered with a strong gaze.
The two Clan Chiefs, almost simultaneously, extended their fins to each other… and clasped them firmly.
