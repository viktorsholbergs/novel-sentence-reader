***Rumble…***
For three consecutive days, they continued to descend slowly, occasionally causing a great commotion.
Chen Xun's gaze was fixed downward. Normally, something eerie would emerge at this point, and they would have a fierce battle.
The big black ox's eyes glinted with determination as his bovine hoof pounded the Plains walls, sending shockwaves that traveled a considerable distance.
"Old Ox, let's draw out the snake from its hole. We're not far from the surface; we need to be prepared in case something suddenly emerges." Chen Xun was surrounded by the Five Elements divine light, illuminating a large area of darkness. He suddenly shouted, "Ghosts, show yourselves! I see you!"
"Moo~~!!" The big black ox joined in with a loud roar.
At this moment.
A ball of fiery-red meteorite suddenly descended from above. The dark wind attempted to corrupt the spell, but this spell was not formed by gathering spiritual power.
The dark wind was powerless against it. The fiery-red meteorite roared through the Plains, carrying the violent power of the Five Elements, and crashed toward the Plains's bottom.
It streaked quickly, lighting up the surroundings, but the walls remained pitch-black, with nothing else visible.
"Old Ox, let's get out of here!"
"Mooo!"
They shot up into the sky, quickly reaching the surface, their eyes still on the meteorite in the Plains. With the Five Elements power surging around them, they were ready to take off in their boat.
After a while, the fireball disappeared from their sight and could no longer be sensed.
"Interesting." Chen Xun sat down, one hand raised to the sky, and the Five Elements power gathered frantically in mid-air.
The big black ox also started casting spells alongside him.
They deviated from the expected approach and began a frenzied bombardment of the Tian Duan Plains, determined to draw out any ghosts within.
Chen Xun's lips curled into a cold smile as countless possibilities flashed through his mind.
Although the big black ox's eyes were filled with doubt, he never questioned his older brother. He thought they might continue descending.
For seven whole days, the roaring sounds in the Tian Duan Plains never ceased.
"Hmm... It seems this thing is quite resilient, or perhaps our meteorite technique has killed it?!" Chen Xun's eyebrows lifted. Even with his temper, he couldn't endure such continuous bombardment. "Old Ox, as expected, it's temporarily safe here."
"Moo~~~" The big black ox's eyes widened as he exhaled a hot breath, slowly retracting the Five Elements power into his body.
"Hehe, let's go!"
"Moo!"
They suddenly emitted a sly shriek, and two black shadows darted into the Plains with incredible speed, far surpassing ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were surrounded by ten large fireballs, lighting up the surroundings like fireflies in the night.
Yet it remained eerily quiet and desolate, with only the dark wind swirling in all directions and no cries of living beings to be heard.
Half a month later.
Chen Xun and the big black ox suddenly stopped mid-air, their eyes revealing an unusual color. They discovered a unique stone on the Plains wall, no longer just ordinary debris affected by the dark wind.
This stone was translucent black, about the size of a fist, with spider web-like fine lines inside it.
"Old Ox, what is this?"
"Moo?"
Their eyes gleamed. Chen Xun instinctively probed the stone with his divine sense, but his expression suddenly changed. "Damn it!"
"Moo Moo?!" The big black ox exclaimed, eyes wide with concern, quickly placing a hoof on Chen Xun. What happened?
"Old Ox, don't use divine sense to probe this thing; it's problematic." Chen Xun's face darkened, feeling dazed, and after a while, he recovered. "This stone harms divine sense."
"Moo!" The big black ox's eyes flashed with anger. How dare this stone harm his older brother!
"Dig it out." Chen Xun drew a mountain-opening axe and struck the Plains wall heavily.
Immediately, deathly energy spread, turning chunks of stone into a viscous substance, which then gradually disintegrated into fine dust.
"Moo!" The big black ox waved his hoof, quickly using the Water Spirit Technique to suppress the deathly energy and protect the stone.
"Hehe, is this all? It still can’t withstand the deathly energy?!"
Chen Xun laughed maniacally. The stone showed clear signs of withering the moment it came into contact with the deathly energy.
"Moo~~~" The big black ox grinned, feeling content, thinking about how to deal with this stone in the future to avenge his older brother.
Before long, the stone was pried loose and held in their hands for examination.
"Old Ox, with our years of experience in collecting rare stones, I'm confident."
"Moo?"
"This thing is definitely not an ordinary stone..."
"Moo......"
The big black ox nodded thoughtfully. His older brother's reasoning made sense.
Chen Xun began to analyze with the big black ox, speaking clearly, and the latter kept nodding, his eyes showing wisdom.
"So, this must be a mineral, and one used in the cultivation world."
Chen Xun concluded firmly; hands clasped behind his back. "Old Ox, this is an unclaimed mineral vein!"
"Moo?!!" The big black ox suddenly became excited. He understood this statement.
"By rounding it up, we are the masters of this mineral vein. We can't miss a single piece of this stone; we need to dig three feet into the ground."
"Moo~~~~"
The big black ox trembled with excitement, exhaling heavily. He even wondered if they should dig up the area around the surface.
Suddenly, the stone in Chen Xun's hand emitted an inexplicable dark light.
Their perception was sharp, and their gaze immediately focused on it.
The dark light was actually emitted by the web-like lines inside the stone, resembling veins. The light moved around, and eventually, a gentle breeze burst out from the stone.
They were stunned. This breeze was none other than the overwhelming dark wind that corrupted divine sense and spiritual energy.
"This dark wind is coming from the stone?!" Chen Xun was astonished, truly having learned something new. "Old Ox, get the booklet and record this marvel!"
"Moo Moo~" The big black ox spat, quickly taking out the booklet to jot down and sketch.
"This cultivation world is indeed full of wonders. Not only are there deadly plants, but now even stones can kill." Chen Xun clicked his tongue, finally understanding the source of this dark wind. "Old Ox, it seems there are many such minerals in the Tian Duan Plains, but I wonder how they came to be."
"Moo Moo~~" The big black ox continued to write, adding many of Chen Xun's recent analyses.
They then began to dig for these stones, finding more and more as they descended deeper into the Plains. The peculiar minerals varied in size, some large, some small.
The big black ox even used deathly energy to break a stone. The divine sense within the stone erupted instantly, attacking them like sharp silver needles.
It was quickly neutralized by the bandit suit, having no effect on their divine sense.
Two months later, they were almost at the bottom. The dark wind roared, raging from all directions.
However, in different areas, the strength of the dark wind varied according to the flickering frequency of the dark light emitted by the minerals.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were overjoyed. Their storage rings were filled with these stones, and they were sure to strike it rich!
