The setting sun in the west descends, twilight descends, and a bright moon rises slowly, bringing with it a dazzling night sky filled with stars.
The big black ox sat cross-legged on the ground, with five medicine boxes in front of it. Its momentum continued to rise, and its spirit was already adjusted to the extreme.
In these past few months, it had listened to Chen Xun's muttering all the way, and it had memorized the information about the heavenly tribulation backwards and forwards. There was nothing to be afraid of!
"Moo!!" With a roar, a golden pill went straight into its belly. The big black ox was ready, ready to face the heavenly tribulation!
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
A strong wind suddenly rose, and a demonic wind swept through the desert, causing yellow sand to fly everywhere like waves. The lines were rough and messy, the colors restless and melancholic, forming a vast, magnificent, melancholic, desolate, and wild expressive style, a breathtaking style.
The weather was changing.
Thick black clouds rolled in, and purple lightning began to intensify, moving faster and faster, many of them already on the verge of colliding and spreading in all directions.
The sky, illuminated by the lightning, revealed a vast expanse of land.
The big black ox glanced deeply in the direction of Chen Xun; although it couldn't see Chen Xun's figure, it knew he was watching over it.
In the distance, Chen Xun looked up at the sky, his eyes showing a hint of nervousness and panic.
He remembered that he hadn't shown such an expression during his tribulation. He remembered that he had been very calm at that time...
Boom! Boom!
The thunderclouds finally converged, and a thick thunderbolt struck down, smashing onto the ground where the big black ox stood!
Chen Xun's heart skipped a beat. If something happened to the old ox, he already had a plan to retreat. After all, living forever was just freeloading...
He took a deep breath and sat down slowly. He had told the big black ox countless times about every detail of the heavenly tribulation. There was no problem.
Boom!
Another burst of thunderous force erupted, and Chen Xun's fingers trembled as if they had struck deep into his heart.
He remained calm as he took out the painting, his face solemn, and gently stroked it.
It seemed that the big black ox was always so simple and silly, believing everything he said without any doubt.
The sky flashed with lightning, illuminating the boundless land.
Boom! Boom!
"Moo!"
The power of thunder rose, carrying a destructive aura, mercilessly crashing towards the ground where the big black ox stood.
"Old ox! If you survive this tribulation, I'll buy you a little female ox! From now on, you'll have plenty of good stuff to eat!!"
Chen Xun suddenly roared in angerâ€”his ultimate move, the ultimate art of painting big pies!
"Moo!!!"
Under the heavenly tribulation, the big black ox seemed to hear Chen Xun's voice, and it seemed to roar in response, believing him again!
"My brother is going through a tribulation today. I hope all the immortals and Buddhas will bless him and give him some face!"
Chen Xun continued, his eyes flashing with a fierce look, "Also, it's for your own sake...a way out!"
Chen Xun's spiritual consciousness spread in all directions. If anyone dared to be ignorant, he would make them understand the meaning of life.
The thunder continued to gather, the power of the heavenly tribulation growing stronger, and time passed by bit by bit.
As the sun rose, majestic and magnificent, it seemed to herald the eternal passage of time.
As the heavenly might dissipated and the thunderclouds gradually dispersed, the earth was devastated, with scorched earth everywhere, all the aftermath of the rampant thunder power.
Under the heavenly tribulation, the big black ox's breath at this moment was obviously weak to the extreme, like a candle about to be extinguished.
It seemed to be wrapped in a blood cocoon, recovering at an unbelievable speed, its breath constantly strengthening.
Chen Xun widened his eyes, his heart filled with excitement. Although he couldn't understand what was happening, as long as the big black ox survived, that was all that mattered.
It was a spiritual beast, and its situation after the tribulation was definitely different from his. Chen Xun didn't delve into it; his knowledge was limited.
After who knows how long...
The blood cocoon slowly shattered, and the big black ox walked out slowly, as if reborn from the broken cocoon.
"Awesome..." Chen Xun murmured that the big black ox had grown fur, like a sturdy yak, and was quite handsome.
The big black ox slowly stood up, its eyes full of astonishment, its two front hooves had actually evolved.
It stood up without any strangeness, very naturally, but feeling uncomfortable all over, it still preferred to keep all fours on the ground.
"Isn't this the Pure Ox Demon?!" Chen Xun muttered to himself, remembering the games he used to play in his past life.
The big black ox shook its body, surrounded by spiritual energy, and gradually returned to its original form; even its fur was retracted.
"Moo!!" It looked at Chen Xun excitedly, running towards him frantically.
"Old ox!" Chen Xun also laughed and ran towards it.
The two met halfway, with the big black ox constantly rubbing against Chen Xun and the latter embracing the ox's head.
Chen Xun understood the big black ox's meaning. If he were turned into a dog and walked on all fours every day, he wouldn't like it either.
Freedom was the most important thing. Chen Xun didn't care at all, feeling greatly relieved that nothing had happened.
"Old ox, tidy up a bit, then let's find another place. It's not suitable to stay here for long."
"Moo~"
They both used their spiritual energy, and various minor spells were cast at their fingertips. This devastated place was completely smoothed out, then gradually covered by yellow sand.
Two figures flew through the air as if walking on flat ground, gradually disappearing into the horizon.
They flew in a straight line for half a month, to avoid losing their way back. The place was still covered in endless yellow sand, with nothing else around.
Chen Xun stopped and looked around at the desolation. "Old ox, let's clear the land and plant some trees, then build a small house. We'll stay here temporarily."
"We haven't checked our physical condition yet, and our lifebound magic weapon still needs refining. There's a lot to do, and I need to plan for the future."
"Let's run away for a few decades first; avoid the limelight. We're not lacking in lifespan."
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox's eyes lit up. It loved pioneering.
Chen Xun took out a storage bag. He snorted coldly as he saw it was filled with Crane Spirit saplings. He had been itching to do this for a long time, and he could also sense the battle intent of the mountain ax.
In the following month, they lived a life of eating dirt, watching yellow sand, throwing stones, and reclaiming the land.
Chen Xun also fenced off a large area of land, while the big black ox set up formations around it to protect the land from the ravages of the sandstorms, isolating it from the world.
No one would have thought that the daily lives of two great cultivators of the Golden Core stage would be so simple and plain, but they always seemed to find joy in it.
Chen Xun often brought broken rocks from outside the formation, then smashed them to pieces with a punch, and finally stood silently, hands behind his back, looking up at the sky.
The big black ox understood Chen Xun's intentions and looked at him with a face full of admiration. Golden Core cultivators were indeed terrifying.
And the system's point restrictions had been lifted, and the essence of all things could now produce 450 years in a month!
Crane Spirit trees continued to grow, only to be cut down and knocked over, and a small house was gradually built.
Just like the thatched houses in the small mountain village, inside was just an empty space, with no tables or benches.
They used to sleep together on the ground and eat together on the ground, never fussing over anything.
