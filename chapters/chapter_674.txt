Li Xijun had been waiting for two months when the narrow-eyed monk descended with the wind in front of the peak. Due to the newly replaced grand formation, he couldn't enter the mountain gate and could only wait in silence.
Seeing Li Xijun approaching in white robes, Kongheng remained composed, pressed his palms together, and softly said, "I heard that you successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, a result of good karma. Congratulations."
Back then, Li Xijun had let him go and allowed him to seize the opportunity for a breakthrough. Kongheng was truly grateful. After offering his congratulations, he heard Li Xijun say, "Master Monk, you must be joking. What kind of good karma could come from my handling of Qingdu’s affairs? My family doesn’t believe in retribution… If such a thing truly existed, we could just sit and wait for it instead of being so fixated."
"This humble monk apologies," Kongheng chanted a Buddhist phrase.He then landed on the mountain and looked around curiously. Li Xijun led him along the mountain path and softly said, "This time, I’ve asked you to return so we can trouble you to take action and sweep the Mount Yue clean."
Li Xijun had already investigated thoroughly and added, "You, I, and Ximing will take action together to eliminate two individuals and one demon."
Li Xijun pointed toward Northern Mount Yue and said, "Jiao Zhongzi has gone missing, but in his absence, an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator named Mu Moli remains in Mount Yue. He is said to be fiercely loyal to Jiao Zhongzi and is guarding Northern Mount Yue alongside his Foundation Establishment Realm mount."
He circled that area with an ink brush and explained, "If this person is as described, there will be no room for negotiation. We must deal with him swiftly and root him out completely."
He then pointed to the remaining area in the south and continued in a low voice, "There is also a Huo Luo'e, who is at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm. If he can be persuaded to surrender, we should try. If not, we will besiege and kill him!"
The Li Family now had the foundation to back such words. Had this been twenty or thirty years earlier, they would have been laughed at. But at this moment, his words carried undeniable weight.
After Li Xijun finished speaking, Kongheng slowly closed his eyes and responded, "It seems bloodshed is inevitable!"
Li Xijun led him into the hall, placed the map down, and consoled him. He said, "These people from Mount Yue and Mount Wu are nothing good. No matter how many times we purge them, it will never be clean. Master Monk, you worry too much."
Kongheng simply looked at the densely packed village and tribe names on the map and replied, "I understand… but as your esteemed family’s forces march through, I wonder how many heads will roll and how much blood will stain Northern Mount Yue. I fear the number will not be a pleasant one."
Li Xijun furrowed his brows, momentarily speechless. Northern Mount Yue was filled with esteemed landlords and it was absolutely impossible for the Li Family to tolerate them all. Even if the killings weren’t thorough, it would still hinder future governance. How could they not kill? He could only say, "My family does not trouble the common folk. Once the pigs and dogs have been slaughtered, only then can those below have better days ahead!"
Kongheng, being an ancient cultivator, did not approve but could only agree. Only then did Li Xijun continue, "This time, I have been waiting for you because I have a matter to ask."
He had been observing Kongheng’s expression all morning and softly said, "Northern Mount Yue is different from Eastern Mount Yue. It is the ancestral land of the Yue people. Many evil shrines are hidden in the mountains, and its people have been deeply poisoned. When Jianixi was still around, there were constant uprisings. I fear this is not something that can be solved by mere slaughter."
"Master Monk, you are the most capable of swaying people's hearts in this world. Do you have a way?"
Li Xijun was thinking of things from a long-term perspective. The esteemed landlords of Northern Mount Yue were merely a matter of execution and sending people over to replace them.
However, Northern Mount Yue was the ancestral land of the Yue people and the cult of sorcery was deeply ingrained in their hearts. Human sacrifices were common and over a hundred thousand cult followers were spread across the land, with ninety-nine percent of them being mere mortals. After much thought, Li Xijun realized that the easiest way to resolve this was through Kongheng.
After Li Xijun explained everything, Kongheng’s face was filled with even greater guilt as he responded, "Using spell arts, divine abilities, Daoist scriptures, or worldly temptations to make people obey is the highest form of heresy. My Liao River Temple must not partake in such things! I am deeply ashamed!"
It was clear that asking Kongheng to sway these cult follower violated his precepts. He once again tactfully refused. Li Xijun was not too surprised by this answer and could only say with a sigh, "Then let them be killed!"
"Ah!" Kongheng was momentarily stunned but quickly reacted with a bitter smile. He responded, "Li Xijun, don't try to fool me. I have cultivated among the esteemed families for many years and I know them well."
Li Xijun chuckled and reassured him, saying, "The decline of the Liao River Dao lineage is partly due to such rigid adherence to rules… How can it possibly sustain itself if it remains so inflexible?"
Kongheng closed his eyes and replied, "The Seven Northern Dao Sects were once no different from my Liao River Temple. Yet, by opening just a single crack, they gradually became what they are today… My temple does not strive to endure but to uphold what is true."
Li Xijun said with a sigh, "If that is the case, what about the millions of common folk in the north?"
Kongheng was momentarily speechless with beads of sweat appearing on his forehead.
Li Xijun feared he might push Kongheng toward siding with the Seven Dao Sects. So he said no more about it and instead smiled. "Then, Master Monk, you only need to assist me in eliminating these few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators."
Li Xijun kept smilingas he gently set down the brush in his hand and continued, "The matters below the mountain shall be left to my family's child prodigy."
Great Jueting.
Fei Luoya’s territory was vast. Though it was mostly hilly, the plains around Great Jueting provided some stability. Over the years, as it came under Li Family rule, the population steadily grew to around fifty thousand.
Now that Fei Luoya had left with Li Xuanfeng, the land had fully fallen into the hands of the Li Family. Along with this shift, many Mount Yue cultivators either departed or pledged allegiance to the Li Family.
On the roads of Great Jueting, cavalry and soldiers galloped forward in an overwhelming procession. At the center of it all was a black carriage, glimmering with mystical light.
Black banners fluttered in the air, while the carriage wheels carved long tracks into the muddy ground. Chen Yang watched as the glow from the mountain peaks faded and lifted the curtain, speaking softly, "My heir, we have arrived at Great Jueting."
Inside the carriage, the young man sat cloaked in a heavy cloak with his boots propped on a cooled brazier. He carefully read the scroll in his hands while Chen Yang kept his head lowered respectfully and dared not steal a glance at the contents of the book.
The Jade Capital Chakra of the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm was a major bottleneck in cultivation. Over the past two years, he had only barely grasped its edges. In the meantime Li Zhouwei had already caught up to him in cultivation.
Back when they first met and fought, it could be said that he had acted hastily. Li Zhouwei had relied on his weapon's advantage to subdue him. Now, however, Li Zhouwei’s halberd arts had grown exceptionally refined. It far surpassed his own half-baked swordsmanship. In daily sparring, he was no longer a match and dared not act rashly.
Upon hearing his words, Li Zhouwei closed his book and stepped forward in the carriage. Looking carefully ahead, he saw the towering, ancient city standing before them.
The city gates, bearing the mottled scars of time, stood wide open. On either side of the road, countless esteemed families of Mount Yue knelt in submission with their heads lowered. Many had even styled their hair in the fashion of easterners, whispering among themselves as they kneeled.
He stood in silence for a moment before giving the order. "Enter the city."
As soon as Li Zhouwei's words fell, the carriage did not slow before the kneeling esteemed families of Mount Yue. Instead, it sped past them and charged straight into the city. On the way, the carriage splashed up high sprays of muddy water which caused the crowd to scatter and retreat.
Li Zhouwei remained silent while his Family soldiers marched in coldly, sealing off both sides of the road completely.
Standing at the front of the carriage, Chen Yang gazed at the sea of bowed heads below. A surge of satisfaction rose in his heart. However, now that he was fully aligned with Li Zhouwei, his cunning nature resurfaced. He reminded Li Zhouwei, saying, "My heir, you have less than a month to recruit troops here… You may still need to rely on these people. It might be worth pulling a few to our side."
Chen Yang’s words were quite reasonable. These people were all the descendants of Fei Luoya’s former subordinates. They held influence and prestige in the region. For decades, they had exploited the common folk while each controlled their own factions. The Li Family’s power was certainly above them but if they could secure their cooperation, integration would be much smoother.
After all, Li Chengliao had not provided any spirit items or provisions for this campaign. Great Jueting was already their territory. If they still required family support to raise an army here, it would undoubtedly be a sign of incompetence.
