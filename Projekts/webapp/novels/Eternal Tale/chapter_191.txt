“Moo moo~” The big black ox kept thinking it was right and decided to tell Chen Xun about it later.
"Old ox."
"Moo?"
"Chop down the trees and don't let them take root or the spiritual energy of Nine Palaces Mountain will be drained by them."
"Moo~"
The big black ox responded with a bellow, never questioning anything, just doing whatever the big brother asked.
**Boom! Boom!**
The valley echoed with deafening sounds of collapse as Chen Xun, wielding a Yellow Grade mountain-opening axe infused with spiritual energy, hacked away furiously.
The big black ox used its horns to thrust and uproot the Crane Spirit Trees, leaving them severely damaged and pulled out by the roots.
They felt extremely satisfied as they continued chopping; the more they chopped, the easier it became. Their thoughts were clear, and now they had one more reason to chop down trees.
For the safety of my immortal realm!
Of course, their good buddy was still with them. Trees had different appearances and characteristics; they couldn’t just destroy all of them indiscriminately.
One day later, The valley was filled with neatly fallen Crane Spirit Trees, all their roots destroyed.
Chen Xun and the big black ox sat on top of the pile of trees and began chatting.
"Old ox, do you want to make Five Elements Formation Flags?"
"Moo~"
The big black ox nuzzled Chen Xun and nodded. It had no idea about the energy source for the flying boat.
The spiritual energy and the Five Elements energy were completely different, and it was impossible to find a way to use them together. They were two separate systems, and the spiritual energy system had been researched by countless generations of cultivators.
"It’s okay, old ox. The plan is just beginning; there is no need to rush. We’re only in the early stages of Nascent Soul." Chen Xun didn’t mind at all. If the big black ox could make it right away, then it would truly be his big brother. "Leave the formation flags to me."
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox exhaled a breath, its head close to Chen Xun.
"Old ox, look at this. I just thought of it—the connection between the energy of the Five Elements and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth."
Chen Xun took out a small booklet and began flipping through it in front of the big black ox.
"Moo~" The big black ox's eyes widened. So, Chen Xun has been working on this.
They sat in the valley discussing, not going out for three days, complementing each other, neither proud nor impatient.
Today, the sun was shining brightly, and a gentle breeze blew.
**Buzz!**
A small flying boat soared from Nine Palaces Mountain, with two powerful cultivators standing on it. The boat seemed to have no rare materials; it was entirely made from spiritual trees, plain and unadorned.
But they appeared somewhat pained, as this boat consumed spiritual stones like fuel. Nevertheless, they had no other choice but to test it.
From the ground, the flying boat in the sky grew smaller and smaller, eventually disappearing into the clouds.
The flying boat cut through the clouds and mist, with a strong wind howling. The big black ox raised its hoof, and the formation enveloped the boat, making it completely invisible.
Even if a cultivator passed by, they would be lost in thought.
"Old ox, I remember the last time we took a flying boat. How long ago?"
Chen Xun sat cross-legged on the edge of the boat, looking at the mountains and rivers below. Occasionally, he saw two countries at the border fighting, with blood and flesh flying.
"Moo?" The big black ox, no longer afraid of heights, squatted beside Chen Xun.
It looked down at the enormous mountains passing beneath them, which were soon left behind by the flying boat.
"But, old ox, even though so many years have passed, we are still together." Chen Xun's voice was calm, his eyes reflecting a nostalgic glow. "There’s nothing more romantic than this."
“Moo~~~” The big black ox exhaled a breath and nudged Chen Xun with a bit of force.
They began to laugh and chat about the past, even pulling out the small booklet to share embarrassing stories.
At this moment, the clouds, light and airy, gathered in the boundless sky, bathed in the dazzling golden light of the sun.
This light also illuminated the two figures on the flying boat, who were dancing and laughing in the sky, their laughter echoing through the heavens.
**Buzz—**
The flying boat moved at an incredible speed. The spiritual energy conductivity of the ten-thousand-year Crane Spirit Tree far surpassed that of any ordinary spiritual tree, as it cut through the clouds and mist towards the Qian Nation.
……
In the Qian Nation, Zhiyang Prefecture, Five Elements Sect.
Two statues towered into the sky, rising to the same height as the main peak, overlooking all the cultivators. They stood behind a giant rock engraved with the name of the Five Elements Sect.
The faces of the statues were blurred, but they exuded a sense of majesty. Having been passed down for thousands of years, these two ancestors certainly deserved such veneration.
Some ill-intentioned people who saw these statues were struck with fear. A sect with two Nascent Soul cultivators—ordinary sects couldn’t even dream of such a thing!
Many of the major sects in the Qian Nation secretly cursed the Five Elements Sect, feeling it had hit an unprecedented stroke of luck, likely having stolen countless talented disciples.
The Top Ten Sects could not be entered, so of course, they sought alternatives, turning to the Five Elements Sect.
Despite the bleak scene in the Qian Nation’s immortal realm, the Five Elements Sect remained very vibrant. The two ancestors had not gone to the northern border.
This was the information transmitted back when their sect went to the northern border, and the Top Ten Sects didn’t pay much attention to it; after all, the Five Elements Sect was their own.
Their etiquette and goodwill were in place, and during major events, the Five Elements Sect’s position was quite high.
Most importantly, they did not believe that Nascent Soul cultivators would lose interest in the northern border, and they had even prepared many excuses to draw them into a common alliance. But the reality was harsh. Even with the war going on, these two had yet to appear, and all their schemes fell through completely.
However, now the Top Ten Sects were in a panic. Damn it, with the great changes in the northern border, these two ancestors of the Five Elements Sect were nowhere to be found!
No one knew where they were hiding or what they were planning. The presence of two Nascent Soul cultivators was enough to influence a significant part of the current immortal realm’s dynamics.
With a lifespan of two thousand years, those who reached Nascent Soul were certainly not likely to fall so soon.
Currently, the Purple Cloud Sect and the Five Elements Sect are closely connected. The mountain closure was just for show to keep out sects with no relations.
Six months later.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood on the flying boat, looking down at the Mountain Range, their eyes wide in astonishment...
What are these towering statues?!
During their journey, they had occasionally stopped at markets or cultivator cities to sell some pills and exchange them for spiritual stones, feeling it would be a loss not to do so on such a trip.
“Old ox?”
“Moo?”
“Could this be us? Haha.”
“Moo~~~!”
The big black ox, shocked, let out a breath. I was very impressed with the statues and liked such things.
“Let’s go check out the sect,” Chen Xun said, his eyes filled with joy.
The big black ox nodded and stored the flying boat in its storage space. They set off towards the Five Elements Sect together.
The mountain protection array was child’s play for the big black ox, and Chen Xun followed closely behind as it slipped in.
Now, the Five Elements Sect's peaks had changed dramatically, no longer resembling their former selves, though the grandeur of the pavilions and halls had greatly increased.
