【Beautiful Girl Detective Akashiterika!】The Superbad Treasure Theft Case 3
* * *
“Now, now, I can’t keep Akashiterika-sama waiting outside in this cold… Please, come in.”
Director Rakigataa, saying that, pushed open the entrance door of the museum, which had a ‘Closed’ sign hanging on it.
And then, holding the door open with his hand, he knelt down on one knee again, waiting for Akashiterika to pass.
Seeing that, Akashiterika held her head in her hands.
“Director… please stop it… I don’t mean to deny your actions of cherishing and preserving the ‘old traditions of the Empire’… but if you go too far, people will suspect you’re a ‘Restorationist’, you know?”
“Oh, I appreciate your advice… but this is something that’s ingrained in me…”
Director Rakigataa, receiving Akashiterika’s advice, stood up, smiling wryly.
Restorationists… are people who don’t approve of the current republic, and aim to restore the former empire.
In this Hirayona Republic, some people from families who used to be nobles of the Superbad Empire are carrying out activities under this ideology, even resorting to violence.
Furthermore, during the transition to a republic, the Superbad imperial family actively supported the movement, so… the common people recognize and despise these Restorationists as ‘selfish, anachronistic terrorists, trying to revive their former privileges without any basis’.
“Ah, Detective Munodes! We’ve been waiting for you!”
“Akashiterika-san, thank you for coming!”
“O-Oh, um, you guys too, good work!”
Next, the police officers who were on guard duty inside the museum noticed Detective Munodes and approached him.
Detective Munodes, putting the dried squid he was munching on into his pocket, wiped his sweat with a handkerchief, and casually returned their greetings.
“Um, so, how’s the investigation going?”
“Sir! We’ve gathered all the related personnel in one room, and they’re currently on standby!”
“We’ll have more backup soon! Once they arrive, we plan to start a detailed search of the museum!”
The two police officers, still at attention, reported briskly.
There was some more back and forth, but in short, no one has entered or left the museum since the discovery of the incident, and the scene has been preserved.
“Okay, okay, thank you. Now that Akashiterika-chan is here, this case will surely be solved soon! Just a little more work, keep it up!”
““…………Sir, yes, sir!””
The police officers were momentarily speechless at Detective Munodes’ overly reliant words… but without voicing their feelings, they saluted again and returned to their guard duty.
Now, Emi.
The moment Emi entered the museum, she was overwhelmed by the beauty of the interior.
Intricate geometric patterns are painted on the walls, and along the walls, there are vases, sculptures, paintings… various works of art, sparkling in the light of the magic lamps hanging from the chandelier on the ceiling.
And then, her gaze, which had been wandering here and there, was suddenly fixed on one spot.
What strongly caught Emi’s attention… was the exhibit placed in the center of the entrance hall.
(A giant’s… armor?)
The moment she saw it, Emi had that impression, but… seeing the cylindrical structure extending from its waist, she immediately realized that her impression was wrong.
And she became certain that this wasn’t just armor.
Because Emi… has fought something like this ‘giant armor’… a magic robot, in the Sky Kingdom before.
But this magic robot, displayed in a battle-ready pose, as if it could start moving at any moment… is different in shape and form from the one she fought before.
It has a tall, slender body.
The magic robot she fought before had a greatsword, but this one has a large, sharp spear.
And on its back, there are many mysterious spheres, each about the size of a human head, attached like a bunch of grapes…
“Gufufu… Are you interested in Steel Index?”
Director Rakigataa, who had appeared beside Emi at some point, started explaining, looking down at her.
“This is an oopart(out-of-place artifact) of the Super-Ancient Magic Civilization, excavated from the eastern ruins of Yoiyattsu, and the second of the ‘Steel Five’ series… of which there are only five in the world.”
“Steel Five…”
“It seems to be missing some parts, so unfortunately, this unit can’t move… but it’s still clear evidence that the people of the Super-Ancient Magic Civilization possessed advanced technology, and a valuable archaeological resource. And at the same time… with its beautiful, glossy exterior, and its heroic, yet humorous design… gufufu, it’s also a very valuable work of art.”
“…………”
“This Old Imperial City Frozend Museum displays various treasures collected by generations of the Frozend family. All of them are first-class. All of them are irreplaceable treasures of mankind. Historical artifacts. We exhibit them, and people experience beauty and gain knowledge through these exhibits. Wonderful… gufufu, it’s a truly wonderful experience! There’s nothing more wonderful than this! And yet… gufufufufu!”
Director Rakigataa, while explaining, started laughing.
But…
There are veins bulging on his forehead, and his clenched fists are creaking.
“Some heartless person… stole those treasures! Gufufu, unforgivable! This is absolutely unforgivable! Gufufu!”
And then Director Rakigataa turned to Akashiterika, and bowed deeply!
“Please… Akashiterika-sama…! Please… please catch the culprit, and recover our treasures! The treasures of mankind…!”
“Of course, Director.”
Akashiterika, nodding deeply, answered Director Rakigataa’s plea, his voice trembling as if being squeezed out.
“Because I am… the envoy of justice, who will not tolerate injustice!”
And she shouted, raising both hands high in the air, an ecstatic expression on her face!
“And the seeker of truth… who never overlooks wrongdoing!”
And then she spun around once, and then stopped, striking a pose, her hand on her chin, and shouted!
Next, moving her arms and legs briskly, changing her poses… and lastly, striking a pose with her arms crossed!
“The Beautiful Girl Detective! Akashiterika!! …That’s who I am!!!”
She boldly declared her name!
“Alriiiight! That’s the spiriiiit!”
Detective Munodes, seeing that, cheered innocently!
“I know it’s a little late to say this, but is that really necessary every time…?”
Emi, tilting her head, commented from a detached perspective!
【Steel Five】
As explained by Director Rakigataa, they are magic robots, and ooparts, created during the Super-Ancient Magic Civilization era.
The one Emi fought in the Sky Kingdom was the first unit, Steel Thumb.
【The Frozend Family】
They seem to have a fondness for art and antiques.
General Tekigataa, who appeared in Arc 23, also seemed to have an eye for beauty.
