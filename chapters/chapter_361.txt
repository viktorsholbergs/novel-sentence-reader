Li Yuanping rode his horse forward, feeling the onset of a cough as his excitement waned. The riding uniform he wore was cold and clammy from sweat. Li Ximing, sensing his father's discomfort, asked, "Father, how have you been feeling lately…?"
"Heh."
Li Yuanping did not answer. His face remained pale as he rode up to the carriage with the black flags fluttering above it. He dismounted, handing the reins to Dou Yi, who quickly took them. Li Yuanping then said, "Take this horse to... to Xicheng. It shall be his mount. Starting tomorrow, there is no need to prepare a carriage for him anymore."
He bent down and entered the carriage, beginning to remove his attire. Li Ximing, understanding his father's needs, lit the brazier inside. Li Yuanping coughed twice, sat by the fire, and spoke gently, "Sitting high in the hall, the letters from various towns always paint a picture of peace. Riding this horse for these past few months, and seeing things with my own eyes, has finally set my mind at ease. Now that we have observed Li Jiman, Ming'er… what do you think of him?"
Li Ximing's face, illuminated by the fire, turned a bit golden-red. He poked the coals with a stick, recalling his thoughts as he finally replied, "I see him as arrogant and cold-hearted."
"Hmm."
Li Yuanping nodded in agreement, speaking softly, "In your opinion, would it be better for Mount Yue State to fall into the hands of the Tian Family or Li Jiman?"
Li Ximing furrowed his brow slightly and responded, "I think it makes no difference who holds it. It depends on who can give our family more benefits... The land of Mount Yue is vast, and the spirit goods and paddies they send up are too few."
Li Yuanping did not expect such profound insights from a child. He sighed softly and said, "It is not just Mount Yue. As our clan grows, open and hidden struggles within the seven towns have intensified. Clashes between prominent families and branch lines are fierce. If it were not for the Clan Affairs Courtyard and the Jade Court Guards maintaining order, there would be even more disgraceful incidents.
"The clan has existed for five generations… If we count from the day our forefather returned to establish it, it has been nearly a century. Achieving success is indeed easy, but maintaining a household is difficult."
As father and son conversed in the carriage, the lead spirit horse snorted and stopped. Outside, Dou Yi called out, "Family Head, we have reached the town."
Li Yuanping led his eldest son out of the carriage. Dou Yi approached and whispered, "Family Head, Chen Donghe and the others are already waiting in the hall."
Li Yuanping hummed in acknowledgement as he walked into the hall. Despite being only an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, the Qi Cultivators inside stood up from their seats respectfully.
Li Yuanping took the main seat and first looked at Chen Donghe, asking politely, "Uncle, what is the situation?"
Chen Donghe, now in his fifties at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, cupped his fist and replied gently, "I have prepared my luggage and am ready to head west with Jingtian."
Li Yuanping nodded in understanding as he reached over and picked up a storage pouch from the desk. He walked down the steps and handed it to Chen Donghe. He then said solemnly, "These are the talismans and Spirit Stones prepared by the family. The town has also arranged two Unrefined Qi Cultivators from Mount Yue to assist with minor tasks... Please take care, Uncle!"
Chen Donghe and his wife had always intended to travel. Officially, they were said to be adventuring, but in reality, they were heading west to the deserts of the Golden Feather Sect to collect Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi.
This was a secret mission. Hearing that Li Yuanping had arranged for two Mount Yue cultivators to accompany him, Chen Donghe looked up in surprise. Li Yuanping smiled and said, "Do not worry, Uncle. These two are heavily bound by ties and have sworn a spiritual oath. They can be trusted."
Mount Yue's cultivation methods were simple and archaic, aligning with the bloodlines of its various tribes. They were easy to practice but not effective for achieving significant power. Over the years, only five unrefined cultivators emerged, mainly tending to spirit plants which were of limited use.
To collect the Golden Yang Radiant Origin by oneself would take at least twenty years. Chen Donghe naturally understood Li Yuanping's intention as he nodded in understanding and expressed his thanks. Given the presence of outsiders, he did not say much more. He simply accepted the silk pouch and took his leave.
After Chen Donghe left, Li Xicheng stepped forward and respectfully reported, "Family Head, over the past five years, Eastern Mount Yue has paid its tribute: 2,100 jin of spirit paddies, 200 White Essence Fruit, 200 jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice, and eleven types of various other spirit items."
He paused before continuing, "The total value is seventy Spirit Stones! They have already been sent down the mountain."
"Good." Li Yuanping nodded in approval. The Azure Pond Sect barely managed the small households in the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation realms, only collecting a small tribute to establish a hierarchy, but the taxes on clans were steep.
As a clan, the Li Family had to pay a tribute every five years, a significant amount of 10,000 jin of Spirit Paddies, equivalent to a hundred Spirit Stones; 500 White Essence Fruit and 500 jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice, also worth a hundred Spirit Stones; and an assortment of other spirit items totaling thirty Spirit Stones."
Currently, the Li Family could only produce less than half of this amount. The remaining hundred-plus Spirit Stones were a constant source of worry for Li Yuanping.
In previous years, they supplemented this deficit through the Cloud Crowned Peak market, issuing tasks for external and family cultivators to collect herbs and hunt beasts. Combined with the talismans drawn by Li Xuanxuan and others, they could barely generate forty to fifty Spirit Stones.
Additionally, they relied on the Ebony Mine on their territory, which, through full exploitation, could yield another forty to fifty Spirit Stones over five years. The rest was covered by Li Yuanping's frugal management.
"Furthermore, we must provide resources for the family cultivators," Li Yuanping muttered, troubled by the modest revenue from Mount Yue as reported by Li Xicheng.
He moved his cup on the desk and mumbled, "Mount Wutu still lacks a large formation and it is truly impoverished... such annual deficits are unsustainable."
Li Xicheng stood respectfully before him. Seeing that his earlier report had been fairly smooth without any signs of awkwardness, Li Yuanping could not help but ask, "What is the situation in Mount Yue?"
Caught off guard, Li Xicheng hesitated for several moments before nervously replying, "The Tian Family holds power... Prince Li Jiman is brave..."
"Enough," Li Yuanping interrupted, noting that Li Xicheng did not assertively say "The Tian Family rules" or "The Tian Family controls the politics." He had completely lost interest in hearing more and kindly dismissed him.
"Go and cultivate."
"Yes!" Li Xicheng cupped his fist and left.
Li Yuanping sighed deeply, turning to look at Li Ximing, who was diligently studying nearby. He softly remarked, "Xicheng is honest and straightforward, kind and generous… In the future, if you manage the family, you can employ your Xicheng, but he cannot be given sole responsibility."
Li Ximing was quite fond of his elder brother Li Xicheng, so he was at a loss for how to respond, simply burying his head in his book. Fortunately, someone came forward and reported, "Family Head, there is news from the Yuan Family."
"Oh?"
Li Yuanping immediately looked up. The person continued, "Immortal Master Yuan Tuan has reached Mushroom Forest Plain and will arrive at Moongaze Lake on the full moon day of the eleventh lunar month."
"Good!" Li Yuanping said as he clapped his hands together, instantly delighted. It was now the third day of the eleventh month, meaning Yuan Tuan would arrive in twelve days. He smiled and said, "Send someone to reply that our family eagerly awaits the Immortal Master's visit."
