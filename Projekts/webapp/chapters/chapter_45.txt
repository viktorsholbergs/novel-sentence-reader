Li Tongya found himself in a dilemma as he faced Wan Tiancang. He wished his family had a few talismans of Qi Cultivation or the Foundation Establishment Realm that he could trade for the Wan Family’s formation.
However, the white light that saved Wan Xiaohua’s life was not a talisman, but rather a defensive maneuver from the mirror against its enemy. This left Li Tongya without a viable option to offer.
“Brother Wan, it’s not that I’m unwilling to trade. It’s just that I truly don’t have anything to trade…” Li Tongya awkwardly explained. He sighed inwardly at the words that left his mouth; even he himself was not convinced by them.
Naturally, Wan Tiancang was not convinced by his response either. He pressed on, trying to persuade Li Tongya to change his mind.
At the same time, he could not help but secretly wonder, This trade is mutually beneficial, but why does Li Tongya seem so hesitant and disinterested?
Noticing Li Tongya’s troubled expression, a realization suddenly struck Wan Tiancang as he quickly reassured, “Don’t worry, Brother Tongya! Besides the formation on Mount Huaqian which is crucial to our family’s safety and can’t be revealed, I assure you that the remaining ten formations of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and three formations of the Qi Cultivation Realm will be fully handed over to your family! Not a single detail will be missing or altered.”
Seeing Wan Tiancang’s eagerness, Li Tongya was indeed swayed. However, there was nothing he could do but to stall for time.
He nodded and replied, “I must discuss this with my father and younger brother before giving you an answer, Brother Tiancang.”
“Of course!” Wan Tiancang quickly nodded in understanding. Feeling that the agreement could pretty much be considered secured, he exhaled and added, “Such a significant matter certainly requires your father’s approval. I’ll await your good news, Brother Tongya!”
After a brief exchange, Wan Tiancang took his leave.
“Wan Tiancang certainly has a way with words.”
Atop Mount Lijing, Lu Jiangxian observed the interaction between the two men through his divine sense.
His mind swirled with thoughts.
The potency of the Supreme Yin Profound Light is truly remarkable, akin to an assault by a peak Jade Capital cultivator at full strength. Even a cultivator in the early Qi Cultivation Realm would find it hard to withstand its might, so it’s no surprise that Wan Tiancang is eager to acquire it.
Lu Jiangxian was pretty satisfied with the Li Family. The entire lineage had embarked on the path of immortality, guided by the Profound Pearl Talisman Pearls he had bestowed upon them. Each member’s cultivation had been accumulated through their respective talisman seeds.
In essence, the fate of the Li family hinged on Lu Jiangxian’s decisions and intentions. This gave Lu Jiangxian a profound sense of security and control over their destinies.
Whenever powerful auras traversed the skies over Mount Dali, Lu Jiangxian would take precautions. He cleverly disguised himself as an ordinary mirror, concealing his presence in the secluded depths of the mountain forest.
His primary goal was to avoid becoming a mere instrument in someone else’s hands. The capabilities of those in the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realms were unknown to him, and it was uncertain whether they could overpower an artifact spirit like him.
Lu Jiangxian was well aware that he might be able to resolve his situation more swiftly being in the hands of immortal cultivators, but he cherished the comfort of his existence in the mountains far more.
Each Profound Pearl Talisman Seed that he gave out was akin to an extension of himself—like tentacles reaching out into the world. They relayed information back to him, aided in the search for treasures, and more importantly, every breakthrough in cultivation by a member of the Li Family contributed to augmenting his own divine sense and mana.
“Always better to be a master than a dog,” he concluded, content with the thriving Li Family under the auspices of his talisman seeds.
Yet, considering another perspective, if he were in the Li Family’s position, having his cultivation under the control of an artifact with its own consciousness would be intolerable. He could empathize with the desire to assert control over such a situation.
The Li Family, though intelligent and capable, was naturally cautious and prone to suspicion. Therefore, Lu Jiangxian had consciously chosen to never reveal any signs of sentience or self-awareness. Instead, he always behaved as if driven purely by instinct.
The prospect of the Wan Family’s formation legacy intrigued Lu Jiangxian. He could not help but wonder how effective it would be to utilize his spirit within the mirror as a medium for setting up a formation.
“How can I help the Li Family acquire this legacy…?”
“Formation?” Li Xiangping frowned, then glanced at Li Tongya and shook his head. “But we don’t have any talismans to offer in exchange. Yet, the prospect of acquiring this formation is indeed enticing. I find myself quite drawn to it."
Moved by the opportunity, Li Xiangping slapped his thighs decisively and abruptly stood up. He grabbed Li Tongya and quickly headed toward the backyard, saying, “Let’s ask Father about this.”
Li Mutian was in the backyard, sweeping the floor. The old man led a simple life, he did not even smoke or gamble. His days were usually filled with playing with his grandson and chatting with Tian Shoushui.
He also kept a watchful eye on the mirror, almost as if fearing that it would escape through the roof window if left unattended.
Li Xuanxuan was cultivating in the side room. The child had impressively condensed seventy strands of moonlight energy with the mirror’s assistance.
Comparing his progress with Li Chejing’s back then, he was only slightly slower, much to the delight of his mother and the other elders in the family.
After listening to Li Xiangping, Li Mutian placed the broom aside, his gaze drifting toward the mirror on the stone platform.
He spoke in a serious tone. “This isn’t a simple decision to make.”
Observing the disappointment on his sons’ faces, Li Mutian narrowed his eyes, then inquired, “What are your thoughts on the recent incident where the demon was eliminated by the mirror’s white light?”
Li Tongya and Li Xiangping paused, then knitted their eyebrows together as they thought hard.
After a moment, it was Li Tongya who broke the silence first. “It seems that such a spirit artifact is inherently destined to vanquish evil and slay demons. Perhaps the demon got too close and caused the mirror to react defensively.”
“That makes sense.” Li Mutian acknowledged with a nod, then added thoughtfully, “If we were to assist Wan Tiancang, we could claim that the talisman can only be used exclusively by members of our family, then launch a sneak attack on Ji Dengqi with the mirror from a distance. However, Ji Dengqi isn’t inherently evil or a demon, so it’s unlikely he would trigger an attack from the mirror.”
After a moment of contemplation, Li Xiangping said, “The Profound Scenery is the starting point in immortal cultivation. Whether it’s alchemy, refining pills, crafting weapons, drawing talismans, or setting up formations, even using a storage bag requires the spiritual senses of the Jade Capital Chakra. Maybe once we advance to the Jade Capital Chakra, we’ll unravel some of the mirror’s mysteries and potentially leverage its power to our advantage in battles.”
“Agreed,” Li Tongya responded. He estimated the timeline before continuing, “The Wan Family has just harvested their first batch of Spirit Paddies. It’ll be another two or three years before the next harvest, giving us ample time before Ji Dengqi crosses the border to assault them again.”
Li Mutian, seated on the stone bench, refilled their teabowls and spoke calmly. “For now, let’s delay our decision until someone from our Li Family manages to condense the Jade Capital Chakra. We’ll address these issues once the power gap between us and the Wan Family significantly declines. Until then, let Ji Dengqi be a thorn in the Wan Family’s side.”
“Yes,” Li Xiangping agreed, taking a sip of tea. He then asked, “How’s your progress, Second Brother?”
“I’m close to reaching the Azure Essence Chakra. A few more months of cultivation and choosing the right day should allow me to attempt a breakthrough,” Li Tongya replied with a light smile.
Gazing at the moon and the moonlight gathered on the mirror, he added, “The Azure Essence Chakra feels much less challenging compared to the Radiant Lure Chakra.”
Li Xiangping smiled and nodded, then remarked in a serious tone, “The envoy from the immortal sect will arrive to collect the tributes in a few months. This is also a good time for us to seek advice on the Wan Family’s affairs.”
