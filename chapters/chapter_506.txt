"Come with me, Senior."
Bi Chengjuan glanced at Li Xuanxuan, estimating that he was over a hundred years old. He called out to the elder and led the three of them down.
The mountain gate of Hengzhu Dao was underground, with a cliff-like entrance in the prefecture where cultivators came and went. Hengzhu cultivators utilized an ancient form of flying, distinct from the current method of riding on the wind, allowing them greater flexibility in their movements.
The mountain gate of Hengzhu was known as the Blessed Land of Hengzhu, a site that was established by ancient cultivators. Bi Chengjuan did not take the three into the main area but instead led them to a hole in the wall that opened into a small secret chamber.
"It's going to hurt quite a bit since we're cutting into your flesh… Please bear with it, Senior," he instructed.
With a jade knife in hand, Bi Chengjuan prepared to make the necessary incisions. Li Xuanxuan, having endured much in his life, was naturally able to withstand the pain. He removed his clothing, allowing Bi Chengjuan to make cuts on his face, chest, and back. The acupoints were sealed to stop the bleeding before inserting a golden pill into each of the wounds.
Li Xuanxuan grunted softly as Bi Chengjuan gently stroked his back. The five cuts, each about the size of a baby's mouth, slowly closed.
Bi Chengjuan then led him further, opened the secret chamber, and instructed softly, "Senior, please go in and sit cross-legged. Wait for the formation to activate."
Li Xuanxuan nodded and stepped inside obediently.
As the heavy door slammed shut, Bi Chengjuan turned to the two remaining companions and whispered, "You two should wait here for three days and don't go out. My people are still upset about what happened in the past... If Master Monk wanders around, it might cause trouble."
Kongheng nodded, watching Bi Chengjuan leave, and then sighed softly.
"Murong... How could he do such a thing?!"
Li Xijun glanced at him and replied, "Isn't he always like that? He is proud of the paradise in his belly and forces you to be grateful after he finishes eating you."
Kongheng fell silent and looked as though he had a stomach full of words to share.
After a long pause, he said, "When I was eight years old, the abbot was good friends with a Buddhist cultivator from Yan State. He used his divine ability and gave me a tour of his belly. I saw a shimmering pool, merits flowing like water, golden sand spreading across the ground, and colored glaze forming steps. The lotus flowers were as large as wheels, in the colors of blue, red, white, and purple, while countless birds and beasts chanted the Buddha’s name, seeking truth. The people were joyous, free from suffering, trouble, disaster, or evil. It was quiet and serene."
The monk appeared lost in thought as he continued, "The Daoist sects regard this as devil cultivation... but I can't discern right from wrong. The Buddhist cultivators of Zhao State seek the ultimate truth and strive to establish a Buddhist State on Earth, while those of Yan State relieve suffering and create a paradise within themselves. The Buddhist cultivators of Yan State enable thousands to find bliss after death, and those in Zhao State alleviate suffering in life, yet ancient cultivators like me simply continued ringing the bell and preaching in the temple."
"Every time the Yan and Zhao State’s Buddhist cultivators arrived, the people of Liao River flocked to them, leaving thousands of houses empty. Everyone was smiling and happy, while ancient cultivators like me remained in the temple planting vegetables.
"The host said that using divine abilities to confuse and control the people is an unorthodox practice that will prevent one from becoming the Revered One. But… I clearly practice Buddhism for the people. As long as the people are happy, I will do it. I can use my divine ability to make unpalatable steamed buns seem like delicacies and simple clothes appear rich and luxurious, but if I focus solely on whether I can become the Revered One and ignore the people's needs, how can I be considered a great person?"
"Fellow Daoist, if you come across a mortal in great pain, would you cast a spell to relieve their suffering?" he asked.
Li Xijun frowned and replied, "Of course, I would..."
Kongheng’s usually gentle face betrayed a hint of fear as he murmured, "If there are true paradises within the bellies and Buddhist State on Earth… Why should the people of Liao River be drowned in suffering?"
Li Xijun was taken aback by the sight of Kongheng sweating profusely, his pallor indicating sheer terror, and even his legs were trembling slightly. The golden light that had previously coiled around him dissipated, now replaced by swirling rings of colorful light that were emanating from behind his head.
Fearing that Kongheng might suddenly shout, I've been enlightened! and transform into a Yan State Buddist cultivator with a paradise in his belly, Li Xijun quickly made a decision.
He struck Kongheng on the back and shouted, "Monk Kongheng!"
Using the Pine Snow True Essence, he sent a wave of cold through Kongheng’s body, causing him to cough up black blood. The colorful light behind his head vanished as if startled, and his eyes immediately cleared.
The monk closed his eyes and began chanting a sutra shakily. After a long while, he said, "Thank you, fellow Daoist…"
However, after expressing his gratitude, he panted heavily, narrowed his eyes, and murmured, "My Liao River enjoys a bountiful harvest every year, and the people live better than those in Yan and Zhao States… Yet, the rich and the poor remain unhappy. The abbot told us not to be bothered by such matters..."
His expression turned somber, and he no longer showed signs of changing to another Dao lineage. Yet, he could not hide the anguish on his face.
"But how can I not be bothered when the wailing cries of the Liao River shook the heavens?!"
Azure Pond Sect, General Affairs Hall.
Li Xizhi soared through the air with colorful lights beneath his feet before landing on the peak of the mountain. As a Qi Cultivator, he was required to undertake a mission every ten years. He had already come seven times in the last decade but had yet to find one he wanted.
I won’t have many years left to wait if I still can't find a suitable one this time.
The Azure Pond Sect did not have many disciples who were truly part of a peak, making it often difficult to encounter fellow cultivators of the same faction in the mountains. Only in the General Affairs Hall could one witness a bustling scene. Stepping inside, Li Xizhi found many cultivators chatting and laughing together.
Qingsui Peak was not particularly popular, and since Li Xizhi seldom ventured out, he did not really have friends. He scanned the hall and noticed several bounty hunts that either required targets to be captured or killed.
Although the rewards for such missions were generous, Li Xizhi never accepted any. His family was in Moongaze Lake, and he dared not offend anyone.
After skimming through requests related to slaying demons and various missions that required one to travel across the four seas or to the northern and southern borders, he finally spotted a few local missions concerning the search for spirit items in Yue State.
The first one that caught his attention read: Supreme Yin Moonlight… Those who find it will receive thirty great merits and three Essence Gathering Pills…
Heavenly Pure Essence… Those who find it will receive…
A long list of rewards followed.
Li Xizhi sighed as he considered them. Such missions were often impossible to fulfill, so he quickly moved on and found a few entries at the bottom that involved long-term assignments.
"Market in Libu Prefecture... Guard... Gather Qi… Approximately five years."
While others viewed such missions as troublesome and a waste of time, Li Xizhi found them appealing. Overjoyed, he quickly removed the jade pendant hanging at the side of the post.
So what if it takes some time? This is a perfect opportunity to return home! I can receive a talisman, take a pill, and help out a little.
He closely inspected the removed jade pendant, only to discover a name written on the back of it. It turned out it had been hanging for too long without being claimed, so it had been assigned to Lingdou Peak.
