Time continuously delineates the beautiful scenes in life and also writes about countless people's strength and resilience in adversity.
Chen Xun and the big black ox have been peacefully living in the deep mountains for fifty years, already achieving the cultivation level of Foundation Establishment Great Perfection!
Although their divine consciousness hasn't significantly increased, their mana has deepened quite a bit, with a noticeable difference compared to the late Foundation Establishment stage.
Moreover, their foundation is extremely solid. After all, they have long surpassed the lifespan of Foundation Establishment cultivators, something ordinary people couldn't even dream of.
Over these years, various herbs for the Five Elements Pills have been successfully cultivated by the big black ox, absolutely capable of withstanding Chen Xun's extravagance.
They've allocated their immortal points to the speed and essence of all things.
Their current immortal points are: Strength 50, Speed 90 (50), Essence of All Things 82 (50), Spiritual Energy 90 (50), Defense 90 (50).
Inside the cave, the big black ox looked tense, continuously scattering petals and occasionally patting Chen Xun's shoulders.
Chen Xun sat cross-legged on the ground, draped in the hide of a fierce tiger, his momentum continually rising, his eyes revealing an invincible dominance.
"The auspicious time has come. I, this Daoist, will begin alchemy. I hope the immortal gods and Buddhas will bless us, and I also hope that everyone..." Chen Xun paused here, his eyes flashing coldly, and slowly uttered, "Don't refuse to show respect!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox stared with wide eyes, its hooves trembling, completely submitting to Chen Xun's aura of dominance.
It didn't dare to think or speak otherwise, not even in its dreams. Truly worthy of being its big brother, so awesome.
"Old ox, bring out the spirit herbs!"
"Moo!"
With a wave of its hoof, the big black ox brought forth countless millennium spirit herbs like a river, emitting rich spiritual energy.
But the cave had already been completely shielded by its array, ensuring that nothing would disturb Chen Xun's alchemy.
"Hmph, just some Five Elements Pills. What's so difficult about that? Furnace, come out!"
Chen Xun shouted loudly, and the alchemy furnace spiraled up into the sky. Five sparkling white dan flames flashed in mid-air, extremely cold.
His eyes narrowed slightly, his divine consciousness spreading out, continuously manipulating the spirit herbs with his vast mana.
The big black ox quickly retreated into the underground chamber, cautiously sticking out an ox head, its divine consciousness spreading outside, observing the situation at any time.
One year later.
A strange laughter echoed in the cave: "You dare not give face to this Daoist?!"
"Moo moo!"
...
Another year passed in the spring and summer.
A strange and eerie voice echoed in the cave: "Heh, old ox, burn incense for a bath, and worship the immortal gods and Buddhas."
"Moo moo!"
...
Another year went by. What couldn't be retained was time, but what couldn't be forgotten was... alchemy.
A devout voice echoed in the cave: "This Daoist was ignorant and offended everyone back then. I hope for forgiveness!"
"Moo moo~"
...
The wind came and went, the flowers bloomed and withered, and another year of prosperity arrived.
A heart-wrenching cry echoed in the cave: "Give this Daoist some face!!!"
"Moo~~~!"
...
Four years later, the huge stone at the entrance of the cave burst open, and even the flag array outside was overturned.
The big black ox was so anxious that it bellowed loudly, quickly using its art to preserve its flag array. It curled up at the entrance of the cave, weakly watching a man.
"Eight years! A full eight years! Hahaha..."
The man seemed a bit crazy—bloodshot eyes, disheveled hair—and was walking step by step towards the cave entrance. Suddenly, he looked at the big black ox.
The big black ox trembled all over, its pupils quivering slightly, continuously murmuring softly.
Unexpectedly, Chen Xun's spiritual energy had greatly increased, coupled with the enhancement of his spells.
"Old ox!"
"Moo~" The big black ox trembled all over, subconsciously wagging its tail.
"It's done... I've figured out the method of refining." Chen Xun suddenly showed a look of melancholy in his eyes. All the pain was worth it.
"Moo~~" The big black ox was so excited that it pounced on Chen Xun, who laughed heartily, constantly patting it and reassuring it.
The noon sunlight was intense and radiant. Chen Xun raised his hand, pinching the Gold Element Dan between his fingers, and held it above his head, allowing the sunlight to penetrate through, refracting a marvelous aura of spiritual power.
The big black ox looked on in astonishment. The Gold Element Dan was the size of a quail egg, with a golden, transparent exterior and a dark core.
Round and flawless.
Chen Xun looked satisfied with his masterpiece, which was truly a perfect work of art and highly collectible.
Over these eight years, they continued to allocate their longevity points to vitality. When the breakthrough comes, it will be the day the Tree King ascends!
"Old ox, go soak in the river for a bath and rest for a few days."
Chen Xun exhaled a stale breath; he still needed to organize his thoughts; this was only a middle-grade Gold Element Dan after all.
"Moo moo~" The big black ox grinned, releasing mana from its body.
Gradually, the cave was covered by an illusionary array, concealing many valuable items inside to prevent them from being dug up by any wild beasts.
Chen Xun fully agreed. After living here for many years, there was nobody around anyway, so there was no risk of someone detecting the array.
The man and the ox gradually moved away, blending relaxation and cultivation, ensuring that their thoughts flowed freely.
In the mountains, a small river flowed quietly, its surface shimmering under the sunlight, with a few leaves casually drifting across.
Suddenly, a huge ripple appeared on the surface of the river, splashing countless crystal-clear water droplets.
"Old ox, damn it, there's a big fish over there; stab it!"
"Moo!"
"Haha, old ox, you're not bad."
"Moo!!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox, with their unobtrusive mana, held a fishing spear in their hands. The big black ox held a fishing spear in its mouth and caught the fish.
The man and the ox had great fun playing together. Sometimes, when they got impatient, Chen Xun would swing his axe down.
When the big black ox got impatient, it used its mana directly, making the big fish ripe as soon as it surfaced, and then it ate it.
As night fell, the stars twinkled in the sky, seeming motionless, while their reflections danced on the water's surface, flowing along with the river, carrying the stars away.
In the river, two faces and a bonfire were reflected, all surrounded by grilled fish.
"Old ox, have you ever seen the sea?"
"Moo?" The big black ox shook its head in confusion. Wasn't the sea just like a river?
"Don't laugh at me, but I've never seen it either..."
Chen Xun said it sincerely. In his past life, he had only seen it online. "I checked the map of the Qian Nation, and there's no sea around here."
While eating grilled fish, the big black ox fell into contemplation, shaking its head again, unable to imagine.
"In the future, when we cross the Tian Duan Great Plain and reach the legendary super country, maybe there'll be a sea."
"Moo?!" The big black ox widened its eyes, suddenly excited again.
"Hehe, we still have many places to go. Let's improve our strength first."
Chen Xun was full of oil in his mouth, foolishly fantasizing, "When the time comes, we'll build a big ship and take you out to sea for fishing!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox stopped eating the fish, eagerly running to Chen Xun's side and rubbing against him happily.
The oil from its mouth got on Chen Xun's body, but he didn't notice.
"Old ox, let's go. After we refine the Five Elements Pills, we'll set off for the border between the two provinces."
Chen Xun clapped his hands. With a flick of Dust Removal Art, his body instantly became clean, without a single stain.
"Structuring pills in such a place might alarm the people around. Pill structuring is a big deal, so we must proceed with caution."
"Moo~"
Mana swept the ground, erasing all traces. For them, this was the benefit of cultivation, allowing them to enjoy life better.
They began to live disciplined lives again. Chen Xun summarized his experience in alchemy, while the big black ox assisted or cultivated herbs on the side and occasionally studied formations when there was nothing else to do.
On the path of longevity and cultivation, this man and ox didn't even know what loneliness was, only harboring anticipation for the future.
...
As time passed unnoticed, how many springs and autumns had gone by in their memories, and fifty years had passed.
In the Five Elements Sect, an inexplicable gravestone appeared, the tomb of Chen Xun's junior brother...
In the Qian Nation and the Wu Nation, many geniuses emerged in recent years, declaring their departure from seclusion. They fought among peers, seeking enlightenment in battles.
Although the overall situation in the cultivation world had stabilized, conflicts never ceased.
Many sects had friction, and true abilities were displayed in conflicts. Numerous local skirmishes erupted in various regions of the two countries.
In an unknown mountain range in Zhiyang Prefecture, outside a cave.
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged a glance, gradually smiling.
Boom...
A loud noise came from behind them; countless rock fragments came flying, but they couldn't get close. With light steps, they disappeared without a sound.
The Five Elements Pills were finally complete, each with its own pill pattern! Just like the Foundation Establishment Pills back then.
Chen Xun finally admitted that he didn't have a talent for alchemy, but fortunately, he had longevity and countless spirit herbs.
Over these years, all their longevity points had been added to their strength, and now all five aspects were fully maxed out, just waiting to break through.
Their current immortal points were: Strength 90 (50), Speed 90 (50), Essence of All Things 90 (50), Spiritual Energy 90 (50), Defense 90 (50).
Chen Xun and the big black ox were slightly excited. They headed towards the border between the two provinces, checking the current year along the way, hoping that there wouldn't be any dynastic changes...
