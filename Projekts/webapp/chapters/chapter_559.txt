Li Xijun parted ways with Li Ximing, returning alone to his cave dwelling to rest. Having missed his opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer, he knew it would take some time before he could attempt it again. Sitting in the cave with his hand resting on his sword, he fell into deep thought.
The Bright Yang Dao Lineage might be on Mount Luoxia, but it's unlikely I'll ever have access to it. The techniques granted by the Immortal Mirror are unpredictable and only last through the Foundation Establishment Realm. It seems I can't rely solely on external resources…
Li Xijun had hinted to Li Ximing about the situation to gauge his response, as he knew Li Ximing prioritized cultivation above all else. When he reached a bottleneck in his path, there was no telling what actions he might take. Li Xijun himself felt uncertain about his own Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough, fearing he might not survive it.
If that day truly comes… without me here to mediate, things might get ugly.
This worry weighed heavily on him. Li Yuanjiao remained fixated on the jade buckle, and though Li Xijun could not assist him with it, he understood that Yu Muxian would not be easy to deal with. Should things come to a crisis, Li Yuanjiao's decisive nature would not wait for Yu Muxian to achieve the Purple Mansion Realm.
With a sigh, Li Xijun set these thoughts aside for now.
He bore no resentment toward Li Ximing over this. Li Ximing had been exceptionally gifted since birth, and if he could acquire the right cultivation method, he showed true potential for being the first in the family to achieve the Purple Mansion Realm. The allure of divine abilities was powerful, and it was natural for him to pursue his aspirations with all his focus.
"After all, the allure of roaming the Great Void, divine abilities to reflect the mysteries, living for five centuries, with honors from the immortal sects, freedom to toy with the mortal world, and insight into hidden secrets—such temptations surpass all else!" Li Xijun sighed, convincing himself of such great temptations.
To possess his own Bright Yang divine ability, to traverse the Great Void freely, embracing beauty and warding off calamities without being a pawn to be sacrificed at will… to witness the rise and fall of clouds and to be honored wherever he went, no matter whom he met—such a vision was irresistibly enticing.
The temptation Li Ximing faced was on a different scale altogether… While the rest of them could spend some time on mundane affairs and only circle around the Foundation Establishment Realm sooner or later, Li Ximing's choices could determine whether he ascended to that level. Faced with such a decision, his indecisiveness was understandable. For Li Xijun, it left little room for blame.
As he sat in contemplation, there came a gentle knock at the door of his cave. A young girl entered, dressed in a white dress who was around fifteen or sixteen, with an attractive pair of phoenix eyes. She spoke softly, "Elder Brother, Brother Ming asked me to bring over a dharma artifact…"
This girl was Li Yuexiang, now at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing realm. She did not like to travel, preferring to spend her days on Mount Qingdu. Li Xijun glanced at her and saw that she was offering him a jade bead.
The bead was a rich blue-green and tied with a red string; it was the Azure Manifestation, an exceptional dharma artifact at the Qi Cultivation Realm, just shy of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Li Yuexiang then continued, "Brother Ming mentioned that he has already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, so this artifact, which can summon a peak Qi Cultivation Realm green deer, is of no further use to him. He asked me to bring it to you."
Li Xijun looked at the jade bead and replied softly, "Take it and use it yourself… "
"I spend my days on the mountain and have no need for something this valuable. Let us save it for Chenghuai," Li Yuexiang replied.
Li Chenghuai, sent back by Li Xizhi, was now studying on the mountain, though he had not yet reached the age for cultivation. Li Yuexiang, strong-willed as ever, firmly declined and placed the bead on the table. Left with no choice, Li Xijun nodded and asked gently, "Have you chosen a spiritual qi type? What technique are you planning to cultivate?"
Li Yuexiang answered, "I plan to consume the Long Marching Pheasant Flame and cultivate the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique."
Noticing she had not consulted Li Yuanjiao on her choice, Li Xijun felt a slight headache coming on but nodded silently. Li Yuexiang added, "Brother, you should think more about yourself."
Li Xijun simply nodded, waving her off, then spread out the registry on the table. Several of the Cheng and Ming generation were close to the Qi Cultivation Realm, and he needed to make proper arrangements for them.
Now, the Qi Cultivation Realm itself was no longer significant; only the Foundation Establishment Realm could bring someone into the Li Family's core decision-making circle. Li Xijun reread the names of the dozen or so disciples, thinking to himself, Who knows how many will fall along the way, or how many will reach the Foundation Establishment Realm…
On Mount Yuting.
Time passed as Li Qinghong continued her cultivation for several months. She opened her eyes and, as usual, circulated her Immortal Foundation, enveloping herself in a field of purple light.
It's time to perform the spell and call upon the lightning again!
Casting the spell and reciting the incantation, powerful purple light surged forward, and lightning flickered. The statues on her right began to light up one by one, and a wave of information flooded her mind, "March 23rd, north of Wintersweet City in Yue State… Mystic Thunder descends on Mount Douxuan… October 6th, Mount Fenkuai in Yue State… Celestial Yin Thunder descends… December 2nd, Goose Lake Island off the Qunyi Cape… Towering Thunder descends…"
A succession of messages unfolded, with over a dozen in total, ending with a hazy, broken phrase, "Flood Dragon kin… forbidden to attain Converging Water… now returns to Heaven and Earth… Falling Water Rising Storm in Eastern Sea."
Li Qinghong processed the information, feeling an inner shock growing within her as realization dawned on her.
A demon king has fallen in the Eastern Sea!
The message from the altar confirmed that a demon king at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm had failed in their Golden Core Realm breakthrough, resulting in death and the dissolution of their Dao. This failure triggered a cascade of celestial phenomena, including the Descent of Thunder and Falling Water Rising Storm.
The news, unexpected as it was, could not be immediately capitalized on, but knowing something of this magnitude put her a step ahead. She could not help but feel a spark of excitement, This altar has this kind of function! Now, with Heaven and Earth in turmoil and even communication talismans failing, its usefulness is immense! If I can know of these events in advance, I can help the family prepare better.
The Dao of thunder shortened one's lifespan. Li Qinghong had already lost about thirty percent of hers in pursuit of it. She did not mind, but she did not wish for other family members to tread the same path. However, seeing it now, there was no alternative.
This altar requires someone who has cultivated either Profound Thunderpool or Winter Thunderclap to operate it… Without someone after me to continue this path, it would be lost.
Turning these thoughts over in her mind, another issue surfaced in her mind, This technique came from Lingyanzi of the Purple Smoke Gate… and I never clarified its origins. I cannot delay this any longer… Regardless of whether this was arranged by a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, I must visit Purple Smoke Gate!
Li Qinghong pulled a token from her storage pouch. The token shimmered with a beautiful violet hue, and she gazed at it for a moment.
"Lingyanzi left this token with us back then, allowing my family's disciples to be admitted into the Purple Smoke Gate… This is the perfect opportunity to use it! This time, I will head to the Purple Smoke Gate, pay a visit to Lingyanzi, and then make my way to the Eastern Sea to gather thunder."
Having made her decision, she stood, gathering the few letters by the altar. She casually glanced through them, a faint smile forming as she thought, Second Uncle has finally left the Southern Border!
She then rode a thunderbolt up to Mount Qingdu, where Li Xijun had just finished his cultivation and was having some water in the courtyard.
