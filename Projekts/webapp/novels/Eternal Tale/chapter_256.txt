Six months later…
In the vast expanse of the Forbidden Sea’s demonic nest, the endless ocean waves appeared both magnificent and awe-inspiring.
Amidst the gloomy sky, streaks of lightning slashed across, accompanied by deafening thunderclaps. Occasionally, a massive bolt would strike the sea's surface, shattering the purple mist into fragments suspended in the air.
At this moment, an enormous ship emerged on the horizon. The protective formation surrounding it shimmered faintly but emitted no loud booming noises that might disrupt the stillness.
Chen Xun, the big black ox, and Little Red stood at the ship's prow, gazing into the distance. A suffocating pressure bore down on them, leaving their expressions visibly strained.
An overwhelming will surged from all directions, ceaselessly impacting their minds despite their fierce bandit gear. Their cultivation was being increasingly suppressed.
Suddenly, a mutation occurred. A Crane Spirit Five Elements Tree unfurled its branches, covering the ship’s upper hull. Black and white divine light descended like starlight, enveloping everything below.
“Little Crane.”
“Moo?!”
“Brother Crane!!”
Their expressions instantly brightened. They raised their heads in shock, their eyes filled with astonishment.
Chen Xun stared at the lush foliage above, feeling inexplicably apprehensive. The Crane Spirit Five Elements Tree was nearly a million years old...
He wasn’t sure if the tree had developed sentience, but given the current situation, Little Crane seemed to be awakening and gaining self-awareness.
The big black ox and Little Red gaped in disbelief. Little Crane was clearly protecting them. In all these years, they had never witnessed such an anomaly.
The big black ox’s shock gradually turned to joy. Big Brother had been right—their Third Brother was about to make his appearance!
Unlike Chen Xun, the big black ox didn’t overthink things. Since Chen Xun had said Little Crane was their Third Brother, there was no chance of any adverse developments, let alone betrayal.
Little Red’s fur bristled with excitement as he let out a low growl. No matter how he looked at Brother Crane’s form, it was anything but an ordinary tree!
“Oh my god...” Little Red muttered, swallowing hard. His eyes widened to their limits. “What kind of legendary entity combo is this in the cultivation world?”
Chen Xun’s gaze grew profound as he observed Little Crane. Uncertainty lingered in his heart. He didn’t know if it could be controlled yet and needed to continue monitoring it, leaving no room for risk.
“Heh…” Chen Xun smiled kindly, unconsciously summoning the mountain-opening axe. “Little Crane, well done.”
The moment the axe appeared, an intense aura of death surged around it, tightly suppressed within a confined area, unable to spread.
Little Red staggered back a few steps, his body trembling. This was not mere killing intent; it was something far more terrifying, carrying an aura of absolute extinction—pure death!
Sweat broke out all over him. He still hadn’t forgotten how Brother Xun had used this very axe to cleave the Sea Calming Carp in half, a despairing memory etched in his mind.
“Moo~” The big black ox nudged Little Red onto its back, trying to reassure him.
“I’m fine, Brother Ox,” Little Red said with an awkward smile, understanding that this was Brother Xun’s life-bound weapon, albeit overwhelmingly terrifying.
Even the Crane Spirit Five Elements Tree recoiled, its branches and leaves quivering as it emitted rustling sounds, seemingly expressing goodwill.
Chen Xun continued to observe Little Crane. Its black-and-white leaves, derived from the Five Elements, seemed to harbor a deeper significance, perhaps containing the missing path in his Five Elements Immortal Path.
Shaking his head lightly, Chen Xun muttered to himself. His cultivation level wasn’t yet high enough, nor did he have something akin to a Five Elements Nascent Soul to help him comprehend it. The secrets hidden within Little Crane would have to be unraveled gradually.
“Moo~” The big black ox nudged Chen Xun’s arm, eyeing the token in his hand.
“Old Ox, we’re almost there. This is already the Forbidden Sea’s depths.” Lowering his gaze, Chen Xun looked ahead. “Is the teleportation array ready? If anything goes wrong, we retreat immediately.”
“Moo!”
“Brother Xun, it’s all set. The Five Elements Stones are placed throughout the ship!”
The big black ox and Little Red nodded heavily, though the latter felt increasingly uneasy. Along the way, they had fought countless battles against the purple mist.
What made it worse was that Brother Xun and Brother Ox weren’t using spirit stones to recover—they were relying on God-killing Stones to combat the lingering will in the mist.
Little Red couldn’t help but wonder: could Brother Xun and Brother Ox have dug up those God-killing Stones in the Tain Duan Plains?
They continued their journey, maneuvering around terrifying lightning strikes and swiftly sailing through the skies.
Half a day later.
“Brother Xun, Brother Ox! There are so many cultivators on the sea!”
Standing on the big black ox’s back, Little Red’s eyes glowed with flames, his enhanced divine sense scanning far and wide. It had grown significantly stronger since their first venture into the Forbidden Sea.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stepped forward, but instead of looking at the sea, their gazes were fixed on the heavens. Their expressions carried shock and awe.
In the distant sky, a colossal divine mountain pierced through the clouds, standing imposingly in the middle of the ocean. Thunder roared from the firmament above, crashing continuously upon the mountain.
It wasn’t an island, but a true mountain, one that made all living beings feel insignificant in its presence.
The breathtaking sight where the heavens and the sea met was both terrifying and mesmerizing, shaking their very spirits.
This was one of the seven ancient secret realms of the Forbidden Sea: The Qigong Thunder Meridian Divine Mountain!
According to the Great Li Realm’s legends, this mountain housed profound, world-shaking lightning techniques. It was a sacred place where ancient cultivators once connected with the heavens and a battleground for disciples of the five ancient immortal sects of Great Li.
“Holy crap…”
“Moo~~~”
“Brother Xun, Brother Ox, there are so many cultivators on the sea!!”
Little Red cried out in urgency. Shouldn’t they be focusing on those cultivators instead of admiring the secret realm?
The area around the divine mountain was stained red with blood. The sounds of battle echoed to the heavens as corpses floated everywhere. Massive sea beasts prowled through the waters, their enormous forms occasionally breaking the surface, filling onlookers with dread.
Gale-force winds howled, monstrous waves surged like collapsing mountains, and the air was thick with killing intent. The entire scene was a chaotic battlefield.
Buzz!
The massive ship let out a low hum as the big black ox waved the Five Elements Formation Flag, bringing the ship to a halt in mid-air.
“It’s fine,” Chen Xun said calmly, though his eyes still carried a hint of astonishment. From his storage ring, he pulled out a painting board. “With a marvel like this before me, it’s time I demonstrate my world-class painting skills.”
“Moo!!” The big black ox snorted and rested its head on Chen Xun’s shoulder, eager to provide some guidance.
Little Red froze, blinking at Chen Xun in disbelief. Then he glanced at the violent scene of ocean waves and carnage. He was speechless—Brother Xun was in the mood for painting?
“Heh, Little Red, stop staring. We’re not here to explore any secret realm.” Chen Xun focused on his painting, drawing a series of messy lines on the board. “Relax your mind and come appreciate this divine mountain with me.”
“Moo~” The big black ox turned its head toward Little Red, as if to say: calm down; we’re not here to fight over resources.
“Ha… ha…” Little Red scratched his head and took a deep breath. “Understood, Brother Xun.”
“Fighting and killing can’t compare to enjoying the scenery. Live your life first; then talk about cultivation.”
“Moo~~”
“Brother Xun, I feel the same way!”
Little Red’s eyes lit up. His goal was simply to live a long, peaceful life—a sentiment that aligned perfectly with Brother Xun’s outlook. “But if we’re talking about scenery, the Forbidden Sea has only a few places like this, while the Tian Duan…”
“Damn it, Old Ox, get him!”
“Moo!!”
“Ah!!~~ Ah!!”
The big black ox grabbed Little Red and pressed him down onto the crane’s head, pummeling him as he squealed like a pig being slaughtered, rolling on the ground, and clutching his head.
One incense stick’s time later, Little Red sat quietly beside Chen Xun, watching him paint. He dared not mention the Tian Duan Plains again.
