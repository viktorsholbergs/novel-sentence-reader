Shi Jing and Liu Yuan were slightly stunned.
Could it be that Junior Brother Chen is not very sociable? This is common knowledge among Foundation Establishment cultivators, and seniors would usually inform them about it.
Ji Kun frowned slightly, giving a deep look at the bewildered Chen Xun and the big black ox, a hint of pity flashing in his eyes, quickly concealed by him.
Chen Xun looked at their expressions and nonchalantly explained with a smile, "I have limited interactions with people, and the old ox doesn't bother others much either."
"Moo~" The big black ox also snorted, indicating that they usually go out on their own without disturbing others.
"Junior Brother Chen, no need to worry. Take out the map and spread it out," Shi Jing said with a smile, as if sensing something. He quickly changed the subject, "I'll tell you where it is."
"Junior Brother Chen, the big black ox, you..." Liu Yuan was about to speak, but a divine sense of pressure descended.
"Yuxu City is located to the west of Qian Nation, near the blank space at Tian Duan Great Plain."
With one sentence, Shi Jing interrupted Liu Yuan, pointing to a location on the map, "Here it is, a large city formed by cultivators from all over."
"Thanks for explaining, Senior Brother Shi."
Chen Xun thanked with a hand gesture, his eyes showing realization, focusing on the map, "Old Ox, take a look, the city of cultivators, it turns out to be here."
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox looked with excitement, as if trying to remember the scent, as if it could guide them to the city.
"Junior Brother Chen, the big black ox, come with us."
Sincerely, Shi Jing suggested, looking at the curious duo, "With Master accompanying, there should be no danger on the way, and several senior brothers and sisters will be there too."
He wanted to introduce some of the sect's people to Chen Xun, who seemed genuinely likeable.
"Senior Brother Shi, the auction must require a lot of spirit stones. We don't have many, so we won't join in the fun for now."
"We are not good at fighting in the Sky-Jewel War either."
Chen Xun smiled and said, patting the big black ox, "If it's not too much trouble, just bring back a list of auction items for us. We want to broaden our horizons."
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox also exclaimed excitedly, anticipating many treasures they hadn't seen before.
"Good! I will definitely bring it back!"
Even before Shi Jing could respond, Liu Yuan quickly nodded.
This seemingly insignificant matter seemed to be quite important for Junior Brother Chen and the big black ox.
Shi Jing, with a slightly furrowed brow, and Liu Yuan left. They seemed less joyful than before, as if something had dampened their spirits.
On the cliff, only Chen Xun, the big black ox, and Ji Kun remained.
"Junior Brother Chen, Senior Brother Ox, do you need anything?"
Ji Kun's face was solemn as he stood behind them and spoke, "If you need anything, I can help."
"Senior Brother Ji is too polite. We just want to broaden our horizons." Chen Xun turned around and smiled. "Go ahead; we'll stay a little longer."
"Moo, moo~"
The big black ox, with crescent-shaped eyes, also called out, indicating that they just wanted to see what they might find.
"No need; I'll accompany you for a while."
Ji Kun said calmly, looking towards the distance.
In the dark night, it seemed that there were only dim lights in the residences of disciples scattered around.
The moonlight tonight was not even, but the light and shadows had a harmonious melody. Only the mountain wind wandered in loneliness.
Chen Xun's expression was calm, gazing into the distance with his hands behind his back, a difficult-to-describe momentum flashing and disappearing.
Ji Kun watched that figure, a glint of light flickering in his eyes.
In the blink of an eye, Chen Xun and the big black ox were sitting together, their shoulders touching as they laughed heartily.
It seemed like the moment just now was a hallucination. Ji Kun silently accompanied them from behind, saying nothing.
After an hour, Ji Kun quietly left.
Tonight, the outer sect administration hall was also going to hold a meeting. In the cultivation world, it seemed like everyone was quite busy.
On the edge of the cliff, the night wind was still blowing. Only Chen Xun and the big black ox remained.
They looked sincerely at the sparkling stars in the vast sky.
"Old Ox, I made many wishes. Today, I'll tell you a few," Chen Xun said calmly, his eyes devoid of focus.
"Moo?!"
The big black ox exclaimed. It only made one wish, "Moo, moo?"
"The first one is, of course, that we stay together forever, never parting in life and death."
Chen Xun held the big black ox with one hand, his eyes showing a touch of tenderness. "The second one is, I hope our friends are doing well, even in the next life."
"Moo, moo~"
The big black ox nodded, a bit bewildered. Its eyes showed a hint of urgency, wondering why Chen Xun didn't tell it that it could make more wishes.
"The third one is that we stay happy forever. Hahaha!"
Chen Xun suddenly burst into laughter, and then his expression became serious. "Old Village Chief, Old Sun, Ning Shi, Brother Le Feng, and our neighbors, they all just appeared."
"Moo?"
"Starfalling like rain is not a bad omen; it's their spiritual presence coming to see us."
"Moo!!"
The big black ox exclaimed excitedly. Chen Xun never lied about it.
Indeed, they had just gone to another place and not disappeared. Their merit was definitely useful.
"Old Ox, haven't you understood such a phenomenon that occurs once every ten thousand years?" Chen Xun laughed widely, looking at the big black ox.
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox called joyously, sitting beside Chen Xun, mumbling continuously in its mouth.
The two sat on the edge of the cliff, gazing at the starry sky, softly whispering as if endless conversations were taking place. They didn't leave for the entire night.
The next morning, the eastern sky was adorned with a magnificent morning glow, and a light mist lingered in the air like a thin veil.
"Old Ox, it's a new day again; let's go!"
"Moo!"
Running down together, feeling the refreshing morning breeze, their spirits were invigorated, and their eyes held an indescribable excitement.
However, when they reached the large array in the medicinal herb garden, they were stopped by a middle-aged man of medium build, square-faced, with a somewhat haggard appearance.
"Younger brother, please wait. Can we have a talk?" The middle-aged man focused his gaze on Chen Xun, his voice full of vitality. Surprisingly, he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, making it hard to guess his age.
He was filled with the fragrance of medicinal herbs, indicating that he was also involved in cultivating spiritual herbs.
After a brief thought, Chen Xun nodded slightly, smiling, "Senior Brother... feel free to speak."
The middle-aged man nodded expressionlessly, and a surge of spiritual energy appeared. The prohibition in the medicinal herb garden opened a path, proving Chen Xun's identity.
However, Chen Xun shook his head slightly, calmly stating, "Senior Brother, let's talk here. I'm not too fond of going to other people's places."
"Then, as Junior Brother wishes," The middle-aged man spoke calmly, but his eyes held a trace of anticipation.
The two conversed outside the medicinal herb garden, and Chen Xun, after a slight contemplation, smiled, realizing the situation.
