Li Yuanjiao took the Dinglin Piercer from his hand. The Golden Tang Gate favored techniques for piercers, daggers, and sabers. This Dinglin Piercer had a peculiar appearance and was about six cun long, resembling a thin stick with sharpened ends, designed for penetrating surfaces with precision.[1]
Gazing at Li Xijun, Li Yuanjiao frowned and spoke in a deep voice.
"We were fighting in the formation before… You should have left early instead of staying here. If I failed to defeat Situ Mo, at least you could still get away safely."
Kongheng was present, and Li Xijun did not dare claim he could see through the situation in the formation. So, he simply nodded in response.
Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened as he instructed the others to bring forth the spirit water that was just within their reach. He whispered to Kongheng, "I've been following behind all of you this whole time, so I know Situ Mo did not follow us all the way here. He flew straight to the edge of this pool… and seems to know that we are here!"
Kongheng released his mantra and replied, "Are you suggesting that… the man is acting on a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's order, Benefactor?"
Li Yuanjiao's expression shifted as he considered the possibility. He was about sixty percent certain about it. Earlier, he had used the Qingche Sword's intent, aiming to end the man's life for good. However, he quickly vanished. This made him even more convinced of his speculation.
"It may not be an order… The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Golden Tang Gate hasn't been seen in a long time, and most of its territory has fallen under the control of the Yue Cultivating Sect. It's possible some force bears a grudge against my Li Family and is secretly aiding him," Li Yuanjiao said, his voice grave.
Kongheng fell silent for a moment before murmuring, "Maybe… it's the Wrathful Dao lineage…"
As they spoke, the pool of water before them began to roll as if boiling, slowly parting to reveal a stream of white, crystal-clear spirit water that leaped out. It spun in a circle before filling up the jade bottle in Li Xijun's hand.
Li Xijun's face was still somewhat pale, but he quickly exclaimed with joy, "Granduncle! It's Pure Essence Spirit Water!"
Li Xuanxuan hurried forward to take a closer look before nodding in approval.
"It is indeed the Pure Essence Spirit Water! With this, more people can benefit from the Grade Three Spirit Eye Perception at home!"
This spirit water would significantly aid those who cultivated the Spirit Eye Perception. After mastering the technique, he would also be able to find an explanation for any peculiar phenomena he encountered.
Li Xijun carefully stored it away as Li Yuanjiao urged, "We shouldn't linger! Let's leave quickly."
The group obeyed and rode the wind as they took to the skies. Li Yuanjiao felt a mix of worry and unease when suddenly the jade pendants at their waists illuminated, emitting a gentle light.
"Huh?"
They all paused in surprise. Li Xijun asked curiously, "Could it be that Auntie was worried and followed us?"
"No…" Li Yuanjiao shook his head. He had specifically asked Li Qinghong to stay behind and watch over the family.
While he pondered this, a mysterious spirit mist enveloped him, momentarily hiding him from view.
Just then, a burst of colorful light approached the group, revealing a young man riding a rainbow. He wore a black feathered robe, his black hair fastened with a jade crow. He held a swaddled bundle in his arms.
He laughed heartily and greeted, "Xizhi greets elders and brothers! I was just wondering who was here!"
Li Xuanxuan nearly jumped with joy, exclaiming, "It's my Zhi'er!"
Li Xijun blinked in surprise. He focused intently on the newcomer for three breaths, using the white qi in his eyes to detect any traces of illusion. When he found none, he gasped almost incredulously, "It's really Third Brother!"
Seeing Li Xuanxuan rush forward, Li Xizhi's face lit up with shock as he asked, "That's… Grandfather?"
He pulled Li Xuanxuan closer, his voice filled with disbelief as he continued, "It's only been twenty years since I left; why have you aged so much, Grandfather? This is…"
Li Xuanxuan, now just over eighty, appeared to be well over a hundred years old. Li Xizhi stared at him, dumbfounded. Li Xuanxuan waved his hand dismissively, then looked at his grandson, beaming with pride as he praised, "Good… Good!"
Li Xijun, who was standing behind, stifled a laugh before stepping forward and cupping his fist.
"Xijun greets Third Brother!"
"Y-Y-You!"
Li Xizhi's heart swelled with emotion, his eyes glistening with tears as he smiled and said, "My good younger brother! It's been twenty years since we last met, and you look like an immortal now!"
The two young men exchanged glances, each filled with a multitude of unspoken thoughts, unsure of how to begin. Li Xuanxuan quickly pulled Li Xizhi over, gesturing to the child in his arms as he asked, "T-This… this is?"
Li Xizhi chuckled.
"Li Chenghuai."
"Ah!"
"Oh my!" Li Xuanxuan's face lit up with joy instantly. But before he could say another word, the mysterious spirit mist beside them dissipated. Li Yuanjiao, clad in a black robe, could no longer contain himself.
His face flushed as he scolded, "Why didn't you write to your family about such an important matter, boy?!"
Li Xizhi was taken aback, allowing Li Xuanxuan to take Li Chenghuai from his arms. Despite being scolded by his father, he felt a mix of happiness and sorrow as he exclaimed, "Father!"
Li Yuanjiao raised an eyebrow and scrutinized him for a long moment. The brilliance of the rainbow light and the shimmer of the feather robe danced across his face. Finally, he uttered two words in a hoarse voice.
"Not bad."
Having left home at the tender age of ten to journey into the Azure Pond Sect, Li Xizhi had not seen his father in twenty years.
Li Yuanjiao's letters had always been serious and solemn; he had never spoken to him like he was his child. Hearing his father's words now brought tears to Li Xizhi's eyes as he said, "I have walked on thin ice in Azure Pond for twenty years, striving to live up to my family's trust!"
Silence enveloped the family as Li Yuanjiao gently stroked his back without a word. Li Xizhi quickly composed himself, wiping his face and smiling.
"I've received a mission from the sect to protect Libu Prefecture, which is just up ahead! Please, come with me and rest for a while there."
He glanced at Li Xijun, noticing that his eighth brother looked somewhat pale.
"This is…"
"Just a scratch," Li Xijun reassured him.
Li Xizhi frowned and rummaged through his storage pouch, producing several jade bottles filled with high-quality medicine.
"Take these quickly! Come with me to rest and heal your injuries… You shouldn't delay this!" he urged.
The group exchanged glances, agreeing to his suggestion as they headed north together. Li Xizhi inquired about the injury, and Li Xijun recounted the encounter with Situ Mo.
Hearing this, Li Xizhi's frown deepened.
"I know of this man! Situ Mo is one of the top three disciples from this generation of the Golden Tang Gate. He has a domineering temperament and a notorious reputation."
"However…" His expression turned decisive as he continued, "Based on Eighth Brother's description, this man is definitely far from ordinary. Despite his arrogance, he is not easy to deal with. We should find an opportunity to eliminate him!"
Li Yuanjiao cradled Li Chenghuai, carefully looking at the baby's face with a thoughtful expression as he remarked softly, "That person came straight to us. He either has a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator backing him or has received some critical information. If he were to die, the Golden Tang Gate would surely know and it would lead to trouble."
He voiced his speculation with a hint of doubt in his tone, "Back then, Situ Mo's lineage was defeated. It was rumored that the entire lineage was destroyed, prompting the elders to unite against the Ji Family. Given Situ Mo's appearance, I fear those rumors may not be true."
Li Xijun nodded, coughing lightly as he inferred, "This individual possesses many treasures and a deep mastery of spells. He likely has a powerful backer within Golden Tang Gate, and he doesn't seem to be alone…"
1. Lord have mercy on me, the author is very inconsistent about this weapon. When it first appeared, it was described as a "golden sword" that "pinned/nailed" Li Xijun to the ground in the raws. Then in a , it was described as a weapon about seven chi long (about 233cm long). Now in this chapter, it is described as a "thin stick with sharpened ends" about six cun long (20 cm long). I have revised these chapters a few times before publishing them but I am still unsure if this is a 233 cm or 20 cm weapon due to another future chapter. I can't imagine Li Xijun pulling out a 233 cm long weapon, I can't imagine him being pinned to the ground by a 20 cm long weapon either. So I have decided to translate this as it is in the raws. Maybe it could shapeshift? ☜
