Tian Youdao heard his question but merely looked at him, expressionless.
Tian Zhongqing was momentarily stunned, then suddenly understood the meaning behind his words. His hands stopped shaking as his tears ceased flowing, and he slowly pressed his forehead on the ground, murmuring dejectedly, "I understand now, uncle…"
Unexpectedly, Tian Youdao snorted coldly.
"It has not come to that yet."
Tian Zhongqing was about to close his eyes and utter his last words, but his eyes suddenly bulged upon hearing this. With great relief, he coughed twice, saying hoarsely, "Zhongqing is not one to cling to life out of fear of death!"
A hint of a smile finally appeared on Tian Youdao's face, but it quickly vanished as he returned to his usual stern expression. "If only Rong'er were not such a disappointment..." he said flatly.
Tian Zhongqing knew that the Rong'er his uncle spoke of was Tian Rong, Tian Youdao's eldest son and only offspring. Unfortunately, he did not inherit his father's talents and only indulged himself in cockfighting, dog racing, and other frivolous pleasures in life. This was a constant regret in Tian Youdao's life.
"Looking at the disciples of the Tian Family, it would be bearable if they were merely mediocre, but their failure to restrain themselves truly makes me want to discipline each one I see. Tian Rong is the worst of them… utterly worthless! You are the only one with a spiritual orifice capable of preserving our family's legacy," Tian Youdao said as he waved his hand dismissively, his expression somewhat somber.
"Anyway, this is not the time to discuss this. The only plan now is to seek help from someone," he continued in a deep voice, changing the subject.
"Who?" Tian Zhongqing asked, quickly looking up.
Tian Youdao hesitated slightly before replying, "Li Jingtian."
"Come to Xianyou Peak."
This phrase, simple and calm yet carrying the resonance of ancient wisdom, exploded in Li Tongya's ears like thunder. He recognized it as the voice of Xiao Chuting and felt a mixture of both joy and fear. His hand paused momentarily, still holding the jade chopsticks, before he quickly set them down again.
He responded respectfully, observing that those around him seemed oblivious to the exchange. The ceremony was nearing its end; the disciples of the immortal sect had already left, and only few members of the Foundation Establishment Realm families remained.
Li Tongya rose and swiftly exited the formation, heading up the mountain.
As he looked down at the swift Yue River and the pine and cypress trees peppering the mountain landscape, his naturally suspicious nature made him hesitate briefly. Despite showing no outward reaction, his heart was tumultuous like a raging sea.
Xiao Chuting's Man On Creek and my Boundless Ocean are Dao Partners... He has always looked out for me, but these coincidences arouse suspicion.
However, the Xiao Family's immense kindness toward the Li Family made Li Tongya feel guilty for his doubts. With no way back, he forcefully suppressed his doubts and made his way through the mountain paths silently until he reached the most prominent and distinguished peak.
The formation on the peak was isolated, designed to allow Li Tongya entry halfway up the mountain, sparing him the climb from the foot—a gesture that perfectly balanced respect and humility.
Li Tongya nodded slightly, stepping onto the mid-mountain path where the wind rustled through ancient, cold grass. A stairway of brown wood snaked upward. Xiao Yuansi was already there waiting and greeted Li Tongya with a light laugh and a cupped fist.
"Fellow Daoist, please…"
Since this was a formal occasion, Xiao Yuansi addressed him as a fellow Daoist rather than the more familiar Brother Tongya. Li Tongya nodded in response and returned the gesture politely.
"Thank you, fellow Daoist."
Together, they ascended, almost floating above the ground. After the duration it took to burn an incense stick, they finally reached the summit of Xianyou Peak.
At the peak, the sound of trickling water filled the air. Between two broken peaks lay a deep pool shrouded in a cold mist, surrounded by frost-resistant flora—a truly celestial scene.
An elderly man in white robes, looking remarkably spirited, sat atop the cliff, smiling warmly at the two approaching men.
Xiao Yuansi cupped his fist and gestured for Li Tongya to approach the cliff while he waited below by himself.
Li Tongya tapped his feet lightly on the rocks a few times before floating up in front of Xiao Chuting, bowing deeply and saying respectfully, "Junior Tongya pays respects to the Daoist Master! Congratulations on your attainment of the Purple Mansion Realm and the creation of your immortal clan!"
Xiao Chuting nodded in acknowledgment of his greeting. Li Tongya then patted his waist and produced a jade box, holding it out with both hands.
"Please accept my congratulatory gift… a Golden Bamboo Fruit!"
The jade box had been switched; the one found in the ruins of the Moongaze Lake market was far too precious for Li Tongya to present as a gift to Xiao Chuting. Instead, he had swapped it for a simpler one beforehand, having stored the original away.
"Oh?" Xiao Chuting raised an eyebrow slightly as he took the jade box from his hands. He opened it gently, revealing a glowing, golden-yellow spirit fruit. The fruit's delicate skin shimmered with a halo of light.
The fruit, which had previously been blustering arrogantly, now trembled uncontrollably and could not speak, only mouthing curses silently.
Xiao Chuting picked it up for inspection, and almost right away, the fruit shut its mouth tightly. Xiao Chuting nodded and said, "Indeed, it is a Golden Bamboo Fruit! But it is not very old—just over a hundred years… Nevertheless, it is a thoughtful gift."
Pleased by Xiao Chuting's compliment, Li Tongya's expression grew even more respectful. Xiao Chuting continued, "Please rise, there's no need for so much formality. Sit down and join me in conversation."
"Yes!"
Although Xiao Chuting's words were gentle, Li Tongya did not dare to take such liberties. He still maintained the posture of a disciple, merely lifting his head slightly as if to listen more attentively.
Xiao Chuting nodded and spoke softly, "I must congratulate you on your early breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm. You have a boundless prospects ahead."
Li Tongya hurriedly expressed his thanks, but Xiao Chuting waved his hand to interrupt him, laughing. "Don't worry, I'm not going to eat you, otherwise Yuansi would definitely give me a hard time."
This light joke eased Li Tongya's nerves considerably, making the atmosphere much more relaxed.
Xiao Chuting did not wait for Li Tongya's reaction, but instead continued on his own, "Li Mutian truly knew how to raise his sons… Hearing Yuansi describe you and your youngest brother, it's as if I can see your father's face right before me. It's a pity he passed away so early! I was busy breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm and never got to meet him."
This comment was purely an attempt at a polite conversation. At the time, the Li Family was just a minor Embryonic Breathing Realm family, and Xiao Chuting couldn't be bothered to engage much with Li Tongya, let alone take the time to meet Li Mutian at Mount Lijing.
It was only later, when Li Chejing's talents became apparent, that Xiao Chuting began to take a more serious interest in the Li Family.
Li Tongya nodded, showing a hint of regret. Xiao Chuting then chuckled lightly, shifting the conversation, "I have also heard of the Yu Family from Milin. In my youth, I had crossed hands with Yu Yufeng… His palm technique was indeed impressive, and he was once famous in Lixia Prefecture. He later lost to the younger Yu Yuxie, which served as a stepping stone to Yu Yuxie's fame, much to his shame! After that, he quietly faded from the scene."
Seeing Li Tongya listening intently, Xiao Chuting continued, "He later returned to the Yu Family as the ancestor and has not been heard from since. Unexpectedly, the Yu Family has produced another Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, who has been stirring up trouble at Moongaze Lake in recent years."
He stroked the fishing rod in his hand and whispered softly, "To suppress the Yu Family, simply removing Yu Yufeng the White Jade Fist will suffice."
