Xiao Xian waited anxiously in the hall, unable to calm his nerves. He fidgeted with the jade cup on the table, constantly changing his posture.
After a long while, a clamor of footsteps echoed from outside the courtyard. Xiao Xian, who had been slumping in his seat, immediately straightened up, his anxiety increasing even more. He heard a flattering voice from outside.
"Young Master Guitu, my master is currently on the mountain discussing important matters with his clan brothers... Please, wait a moment..."
"No problem."
The voice was mature and steady, but it struck Xiao Xian like a bolt of lightning. His mind went blank, with only one thought reverberating in his mind.
Xiao Guitu... what is he doing here?
In just an instant, a young man entered the courtyard. He had broad shoulders and a robust build, exuding a majestic aura. The intricate runes on his armor glowed with mana light, indicating his status as an important figure in the immortal clan.
Xiao Xian dared not be negligent. He quickly adjusted his robes and bowed deeply, greeting respectfully, "Xiao Xian of Mount Yu branch greets the young master!"
This man was indeed Xiao Guitu, now at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, the elder brother of Xiao Guiluan and the most outstanding figure of his generation in the Xiao Family. As the head of the main branch of the Xiao Family, Xiao Guitu's presence commanded great respect. Xiao Xian did not dare to be negligent and immediately showed the proper deference.
"Xiao Xian of Mount Yu..." Xiao Guitu glanced at him with a curious expression and smiled. "I have heard of you. The Mount Yu branch has done well these past few years. I have also heard you have some connection with the second young lady of the Li Family."
Xiao Xian forced a smile, uncertain of Xiao Guitu's intentions. He hesitated but then invited him to sit. Xiao Guitu strode forward confidently before taking his seat. He stared at Xiao Xian and remarked, "Not bad."
Xiao Xian secretly breathed a sigh of relief as Xiao Guitu continued, "I have important matters to discuss with the Li Family. You may listen."
As soon as he had finished speaking, several people entered the hall, led by a man in black with a sword at his waist— it was Li Yuanjiao. He stepped forward with a smile and said, "I am Li Yuanjiao, pleased to meet you, Young Master Xiao."
Xiao Guitu looked up and their gazes met in mid-air, each feeling a sense of awe. Xiao Guitu laughed heartily and replied, "So it is my brother-in-law! I am Xiao Guitu. I have heard much about you."
Li Yuanjiao nodded and took the main seat. With Xiao Guitu seated, Xiao Xian had no place to sit and stood respectfully beside him. When Li Yuanping entered later, he dismissed the others with a nod.
As the people left the courtyard and carefully closed the courtyard gates, an isolating barrier was activated. Xiao Guitu sipped his tea and got straight to the point, speaking in a serious tone.
"I came here for two matters. First, our clan uncle, Xiao Yongling, has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, achieving the Dao Foundation of Eastern Feather Mountain. He will take over guarding the north and will not return to Cloud Crowned Peak for several decades."
"Congratulations! It is a pity our ancestor is in seclusion; otherwise, he would have personally seen him off," Li Yuanjiao responded respectfully. Xiao Yongling, being of the same generation as Li Tongya, was referred to with great respect.
Xiao Guitu accepted Li Yuanjiao's congratulations on behalf of Xiao Yongling and continued, "Second, according to the Yuan Family, Yu Muxian has come out of seclusion and has also broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm, achieving the immortal foundation Molten Metal Cave… This immortal foundation has not been achieved for over a century and has even drawn the attention of Daoist Masters."
After these words were spoken, everyone present fell silent. Li Yuanjiao played with his jade cup, his expression somber as he replied, "Thank you, Young Master."
Xiao Guitu paused, giving him some time to think, and then continued, "Molten Metal Cave specializes in smithing but is extremely difficult to cultivate. Firstly, it requires exceptional talent. Secondly, during cultivation, one must constantly endure the pain of skin peeling off... Yuanwu Peak once had a disciple who practiced this method, but he wailed day and night, and eventually abandoned it. Yu Muxian's ability to master this Dao shows great perseverance and should not be underestimated."
Li Yuanjiao nodded, his expression unchanged, and sincerely said, "Our family also heard that Yu Muxian is rumored to be well-connected within the sect, quick-witted, and eloquent. I have one more question... Is this Molten Metal Cave… a certain Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's Dao Partner?"
This question was too sensitive, causing Xiao Xian to lower his head. Xiao Guitu paused, his eyes bright, and answered, "I considered this as well. Before leaving home, I specifically asked the ancestor this. There is no Metallic Essence in Jiangnan that aligns with the Molten Metal Cave."
The two men exchanged a glance, both realizing the underlying issue. Li Yuanjiao lowered his voice and sneered. "Chi Zhiyun really thinks highly of him!"
Xiao Guitu drank his tea unhurriedly and replied, "Chi Zhiyun wants to support the Yu Family at Moongaze Lake to keep our family in check. Yu Muxian is just the lucky one. However, this lucky person is ruthless, which is concerning."
Li Yuanjiao looked up, carefully observing Xiao Guitu's expression, and asked softly, "What do you mean, Young Master…?"
Xiao Guitu shook his head silently and replied, "It's a complicated matter… The divine abilities of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are extraordinary. The higher their cultivation, the more divine abilities they possess, and become increasingly inhuman. It is impossible for those below Purple Mansion Realm to interfere. The fact that the Daoist Master personally received Yu Muxian makes the intention clear."
Li Yuanjiao tactfully stopped pressing. Xiao Guitu cupped his fist and continued, "After Yu Muxian came out of seclusion, there were rumors within the sect about a sword immortal being unwell. Your clan should be cautious."
He paused and explained, "There are very few sword immortals in the world. The Qingsui Sword Immortal was famous throughout Jiangnan and Jiangbei during his years. Now, he has not appeared for decades, causing widespread suspicion and rampant rumors."
Li Yuanjiao sighed silently. He had only recently learned the truth—that his nominal grandfather had perished at the southern border. Judging from Xiao Guitu's tone, the entire Xiao Family was likely aware of this.
He nodded in agreement, discussed some matters concerning Xiao Guiluan, and then had Li Xizhi brought up. The child obediently called him uncle, bringing a genuine smile to Xiao Guitu's face.
Xiao Guitu laughed and remarked, "Seeing this nephew of mine reminds me of Guiluan when she was just a kid. I still vividly remember how she was always rowdy and full of laughter. Guiluan came back to visit these past two years, and I've heard about your marriage… It's indeed good news."
Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily. Xiao Guitu played with Li Xizhi for a bit before sending the child away then cupped his fist and took his leave.
Xiao Xian followed behind, managing only a quick cup of his fist to Li Yuanping before saying hastily, "Please inform me if there is any news."
He then quickly chased after Xiao Guitu. Li Yuanjiao saw them off at the edge of the Li Family's territory and then flew back to the courtyard. By then, the sky had already darkened.
Li Yuanjiao settled before his desk, where Li Yuanping had been waiting for some time. The brothers exchanged glances, and Li Yuanping pondered for a moment before asking, "Brother, how credible do you think Xiao Guitu's words are?"
Li Yuanjiao frowned, tapping his jade cup on the desk in frustration. "It is hard to say. Xiao Guitu is no fool. His words seemed sincere, and his demeanor was measured. It is difficult to discern the truth... The Xiao Family is indeed full of talent. Xiao Chuting, Xiao Yongling... and now Xiao Guitu. None of them are easy to deal with.
"The ancestor once said that although the Xiao Family and the Azure Pond Sect appear to be at odds on the surface, they are quite aligned in private. We cannot be sure what these Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are planning. While the Xiao Family has done us favors, they would not deceive us about such things. But if we follow their lead too blindly, we will eventually become stepping stones for their cultivation."
Li Yuanping nodded silently, his pale face showing signs of unease.
"Yu Muxian's recent breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm means he will surely interfere with matters on the lake."
Li Yuanjiao deliberated for a moment, then decisively said, "Open the cave dwelling at Meichi Peak and inform the ancestor!"
