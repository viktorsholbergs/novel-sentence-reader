Milin Prefecture had flat terrain and fertile land, with a population of 560,000. For a prefecture established less than twenty years ago, this was indeed a large population.
The Yu Family was the largest and the only landlord in Milin Prefecture. The land was entirely privately owned by the mortal descendants of the Yu Family, including the tenant farmers and sharecroppers working on it. Even an ordinary concubine-born son of the Yu Family could own vast tracts of land and take numerous wives and concubines.
The only thriving area was Milin City, which lay beneath the main peak of the Milin Yu Family. However, it was still blood-soaked, like a man-eating beast lurking quietly on the surface of the earth.
Yu Mugao sat silently in the luxurious grand hall at the highest point, with a group of cultivators below him, waiting quietly for him to speak. However, Yu Mugao remained silent, simply gazing at them.
Yu Xiaogui had gone to Xianyou Peak to attend Xiao Chuting's ceremony, causing unrest among the eastern families. Yu Mugao had been interrupted from his cultivation, and as he looked at the submissive brothers, sons, and nephews below him, he could feel his anger nearly bursting from his chest. However, he had to suppress his rage forcefully.
"The common people are displaced, even forced to eat their own children for survival while my family's descendants are having fun—drinking wine, playing games, singing joyously, and whipping tenant farmers. The butchers bring out dog heads, with human flesh laid out below them…"
Yu Mugao slowly stood up and walked out of the grand hall. Looking at Milin Prefecture under the night sky, countless recurring thoughts surged in his mind. He felt a chill down his spine and asked himself silently, "Is this an immortal clan or a domain of demons and devils?"
A deep sense of powerlessness swirled within him. Yu Mugao was a ruthless and sinister figure, yet he never had the desire to torment the people or overindulge his clan. Now, he had to watch this nightmare unfold before his very eyes.
However, Yu Mugao was not the main culprit and was not solely to blame. The Yu Family was already like this when it came into his hands. Even if he wanted to change it a little, the forces of opposition would involve an entire group of interests, which were led by his father and even the ancestor in the cave dwelling.
He raised his head silently and looked toward the highest cave dwelling. His sharp gaze seemed to penetrate the wooden walls and stone barriers, seeing the old man sitting cross-legged.
"Last year, human flesh cost three coins per jin; now it is only two coins… Grandfather, what are you really trying to achieve?"
In the eerie stone cave, droplets of blood trickled down, pooling into a small basin where Yu Yufeng's hands were submerged. He silently raised his hands after the routine tempering.
Attempting to calm himself and enter a meditative state, Yu Yufeng found himself increasingly agitated, unable to achieve tranquility. His hands brushed against the walls, scraping off a layer of chalky limestone. His eyes reddened, and with raw fury in his voice, he muttered menacingly, "Xiao Chuting... how could this be?! How could you have already achieved the Purple Mansion Realm?!"
He was from the same era as Xiao Chuting and had sparred with him many times, with victories and defeats on both sides. In terms of cultivation, he had even surpassed Xiao Chuting. Yet, despite years of dedicated practice, Xiao Chuting had already overtaken him.
Yu Yufeng examined his palms carefully, each still bearing a faint sword scar. This realization only heightened his agitation, bringing tears to his eyes as he murmured, "Fine… fine! You are a genius! So arrogant… cutting off one's cultivation path with a single sword! Why… why..?!"
After a bout of uncontrolled shouting and having vented his emotions, Yu Yufeng finally sat, cross-legged once more. Surprisingly, the outburst had cleared his mind, bringing him some newfound sense of calmness. For a moment, he heard celestial music, as if tiny figures were playing drums and gongs, creating a beautiful melody.
"A good opportunity!"
Unconsciously, Yu Yufeng became more absorbed in his trance-like state, his mind clear and joyful. A vision of a small hill, passing through numerous forests and roads, appeared before him.
"This is... this is the chance for my breakthrough!"
Two bursts of colorful light appeared briefly behind his head of white hair, but he was completely unaware of this phenomenon. His eyes grew slightly cloudy as he was overcome with joy. Kicking open the stone door, he flew into the grand hall.
Yu Mugao, staring blankly at the night sky, was startled by the sudden appearance of a gaunt, white-haired old man before him. He quickly lowered his head to conceal his surprise and bowed respectfully.
"Greetings, Ancestor!"
Behind him, the uncles and nephews who were gathered exchanged bewildered glances before kneeling down as well, their voices echoing in unison.
"Greetings, Ancestor!"
"Hmm…" Yu Yufeng hummed in acknowledgment as he slowly squinted, his face showing a strange expression as he looked at the kneeling Yu Mugao. He asked in a low voice, "Has Yu Xiaogui not returned yet?"
"He has not, Ancestor…" Yu Mugao answered quietly, his tone respectful. The gathered uncles and nephews glanced at each other, speculating that Yu Yufeng must have made a significant breakthrough.
Yu Mugao, however, felt uneasy. Hesitantly, he raised his head and asked humbly, "Ancestor… did you have a breakthrough during your seclusion?"
"Yes and no."
Yu Yufeng visibly became very excited at the subject, laughing heartily as he replied, "While I was in seclusion, I had a sudden epiphany, feeling refreshed and understanding where my breakthrough opportunity lies! Ah… what joy!"
"Congratulations on your epiphany, Ancestor! The Purple Mansion Realm is within reach!"
Yu Mugao's uncles and nephews immediately pressed their heads to the ground, shouting in unison, their voices full of respect and excitement. This extravagant display made Yu Yufeng feel even more pleased with himself as he nodded slowly, taking it all in.
However, Yu Mugao, observing Yu Yufeng's exaggerated expression, felt increasingly uneasy. He began to feel suspicion rising in him and chose his next words carefully.
"Congratulations on your divine insight, Ancestor… The Purple Mansion Realm is surely within your reach. Such enlightenment is only spoken of in ancient legends, attributed to the most extraordinary Daoist immortals. It has not been heard of for hundreds of years, and the fact that you have achieved such insight is truly earth-shattering!"
Yu Mugao had deliberately phrased his words so oddly to hint at his doubts, but Yu Yufeng, failing to catch the hint, thought he was being flattered. Instead, he laughed heartily and declared proudly, "Indeed, it is so!"
This statement was something no Foundation Establishment Realm ancestor would dare utter, striking Yu Mugao's mind like thunder. He knew Yu Yufeng well and such arrogance and restlessness was entirely uncharacteristic of him. Alarm bells rang in his mind, and he could not help the words of caution that left his mouth.
"Ancestor… beware of falling under someone's spell!"
These words exploded next to Yu Yufeng's ears. He paused momentarily, his eyes briefly clearing. However, a thousand li away, a white jade fishing rod was lifted lightly, and Yu Yufeng's eyes dimmed again. He roared angrily, "You cowardly junior, trying to obstruct my path!"
With a powerful sweep of his gray sleeve, he struck Yu Mugao, causing him to see stars and spit blood instantly. Rolling three times on the ground, Yu Mugao spat out two teeth, his mana completely drained. Yu Yufeng's voice was cold and harsh when he spoke again.
"A small punishment to serve as a big warning... Remember it well."
Yu Yufeng then flew eastward on the wind. Covered in dust and blood, Yu Mugao lay on the ground, weak. However, he still cried out persistently, tears streaming down his face as he ran and stumbled over his own feet.
"Don't go, Ancestor! You must not go! Ancestor! Ancestor! You mustn't—"
