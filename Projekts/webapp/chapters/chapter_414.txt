Although Li Yuanjiao originated from the first lineage as a direct descendant of Li Changhu, he had been adopted into the fourth lineage as a direct descendant of Li Chejing. However, the major sect on the mountain was close-knit and typically overlooked such nuances, paying attention to these distinctions only during formal events.
Unbeknownst to Li Xicheng, whose heart ached to see the changes in his second uncle, Li Yuanjiao also harbored feelings of guilt toward him.
Back then, this child wasn't picked for the talisman seed and I had to make him leave the mountain… And now, I have to take away the spiritual qi of heaven and earth aura that he rightfully deserves to his younger brother...
Though Li Yuanjiao felt guilty, his decisive nature did not allow him to dwell on it for long. He paused briefly before saying warmly, "Xicheng, now that you've broken through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, it seems that your cultivation efforts are paying off."
"Cheng'er dares not feel complacent about his progress," Li Xicheng replied modestly.
After a brief conversation, Li Yuanjiao said bluntly, "Uncle Donghe has managed to gather that Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi in the west. It's estimated to arrive in a year or two. This spiritual qi is extremely difficult to collect; the family has spent seven years just to gather a portion of it… Since this resource is so scarce, I'm afraid not everyone in the four lineages can receive it. It will only be allocated to the second lineage…"
Li Xicheng was slightly taken aback before he hurriedly replied, "Xijun is now also at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm! It's better for Second Uncle to reserve this spiritual qi for himself! Cheng'er is not as talented and fears wasting such a precious resource… I cannot bear to make my younger brother wait another seven years."
Li Yuanjiao had not even finished speaking when Li Xicheng interrupted him. He halted his speech, sitting up straight with a hint of dangerous suspicion in his eyes.
Hm?
Having led his family, commanded soldiers, killed adversaries from Mount Yue, and dealt with corrupted nobles, Li Yuanjiao was accustomed to cunning and deceit. Consequently, Li Xicheng's display of loyalty aroused his suspicion, causing him to narrow his eyes as he scrutinized the young man closely.
Yet, upon observing Li Xicheng, he saw clear, honest eyes. Despite Li Xicheng's plain appearance and weak presence, his gaze was filled with trustworthy sincerity.
"You…"
Li Yuanjiao averted his gaze, secretly ashamed of his skepticism. He nodded and said solemnly, "If that's what you truly think… then very well, you may leave now."
As Li Xicheng bowed and was about to leave, Li Yuanjiao's mood lightened. He laughed warmly and sighed, "Ah! You're… You're truly a good older brother... Xijun is fortunate to be your younger brother!"
Li Xicheng turned back and shook his head. He bowed to Li Yuanjiao again and said warmly, "Second Uncle, as the eldest of my generation, whether it's Xijun, Ximing, or Xizhi who is currently training in the immortal sect, they are all my younger brothers. Brothers bound together by blood should stay united. Covetous envy or struggles for power are not in my nature, nor do they interest me."
This was the first time he had spoken so boldly to Li Yuanjiao. Standing with his spear slung behind him and his robes billowing, his expression was earnest. In his mid-twenties, the young man was at the height of his heroic vigor that lent a dignified air to his ordinarily plain and almost overly honest face.
"Good!"
Li Yuanjiao tapped his knuckles on the table and sighed, feeling a weight lift from his heart. He chuckled, beckoning Li Xicheng closer. Taking a jade bottle from his sleeve, he said, "This is our family's secret Barrier Breaking Pill. Take it and break through to the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Strive to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm before thirty… it will do you good. This potion is astonishingly effective, a treasured ancestral elixir that must remain a secret."
"Understood!"
Li Xicheng's face lit up as he accepted the bottle. After taking a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, he patiently awaited further instructions.
Li Yuanjiao waved his hand with a smile and said, "Go now, find a cave dwelling and attempt your breakthrough in seclusion."
Li Xicheng nodded then retreated. Li Yuanjiao took out several pills and spirit items from his storage pouch, arranging them on the desk before writing a brief note to Li Yuanping.
"Cheng can be the mainstay of the clan. He is respectful to his elders and cherishes his younger peers. Second Uncle lived frugally when he was still alive, and the second lineage suffered. Wutu Peak shall provide the sustenance and spirit resources he needs."
After putting away his brush and ink, the smile on Li Yuanjiao's face slowly faded. He gazed into the distant sky, piercing through layers of clouds, and thought he saw a handsome and dignified face smiling back at him.
Brothers bound together by blood should stay united…
Big Brother…
Meanwhile on Mount Lijing…
Li Ximing had not returned home in two years. Upon his return, he and his father, Li Yuanping, discussed family affairs late into the night. After their long conversation, he first visited his mother, then Madam Dou.
Madam Dou, the wife of Li Xuanxuan and mother of Li Yuanping, was a distinguished Qi Cultivator within the clan, known for her formidable abilities.
Li Ximing, who had always been dearly loved by his grandmother since childhood, was now also a Qi Cultivator. Upon their reunion, she eagerly handed him pills and spirit items, whispering, "These are from your grandmother's maternal family… Just use them without reservation!"
Li Ximing smiled wryly as he accepted them, then spent a few days settling a few family matters. Finally finding some leisure time, he sat on the stone steps of the small courtyard under the moonlight and began meticulously organizing his medicine pouch.
Xiao Yuansi had prepared a set of medicine-gathering techniques for him. Li Ximing had devoted himself to studying it and was now seeing modest benefits. At least, he could now store most spirit items of the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms without damaging their medicinal properties.
Brother Cheng invited me to Eastern Mount Yue. He has probably prepared a few spirit items… Big Brother always puts others before him…
As he was lost in thought, a sudden tap on his shoulder startled him. Unguarded in the safety of his own home's formation, he looked up with a smile to see a figure with sharp eyebrows and bright eyes.
"Xijun!"
Li Xijun, usually somber and reserved, rarely smiled. Seeing his brother after so many years brought a smile to his face as he leaned in, sniffing. "You have a strong scent of herbs on you!" he commented playfully.
Li Ximing replied with a warm smile, "That's how Master Xiao's medicine-gathering technique is... The scent is quite potent but it can sharpen your mind and soothe your soul."
"You seem to have softened up quite a bit," he added.
Li Xijun stood with his hands clasped behind him. Among the brothers from the generation of Xi and Yue, he most embodied the Li Family's spirit. While Li Xicheng was generous and Li Xizhi was graceful, Li Ximing was gentle. Only Li Xijun remained cautious and skeptical, carrying his sword with him everywhere he went.
Li Ximing chuckled and asked, "I heard you've been training diligently on Mount Yuting every day… What brings you home so suddenly?"
"Second Uncle sent for me."
Li Xijun's face turned slightly gloomy as he continued in a subdued tone, "I wonder why Uncle Jiao summoned me up the mountain. He spoke of Big Brother's generous nature, insisting that it not be taken for granted… He also mentioned that I am more talented and should watch out for my big brother."
His gray-black eyes shimmered in the moonlight, giving him a particularly striking look as he added with a hint of suspicion, "I wonder if he's indirectly blaming me… Given my big brother's nature, who wouldn't get along with him? Could someone be gossiping..?"
Li Ximing replied softly, "Uncle Jiao lost his brother when he was younger… Perhaps he was just being emotional and fearing that history would repeat itself. I've heard that the performances in the Liyuan Theater below the mountain often leave the audience in tears, regardless of their age."
The two fell silent for a while. Li Xijun, cradling his sword, finally spoke softly after a long pause.
"Brother Cheng is gradually taking over home affairs. Our half-brothers have families of their own, you and I are approaching the Qi Cultivation Realm and Second Uncle is nearing the Foundation Establishment Realm… The clan's future will soon rest in our hands."
He turned his head slightly to the side, the cold blade in his arms catching the moonlight and gleaming coldly as he chuckled.
"Study well with the fire, while I take to the snowy paths… With your medicine and my blade, the clan has nothing to fear!"
Li Ximing laughed in cheerful agreement.
"Indeed!"
The two brothers shared spirit wine under the moonlight, conversing through the night—from Azure Pond to Jiangnan and its northern reaches. It was only when dawn broke, painting the world in golden red, that they staggered to their beds.
