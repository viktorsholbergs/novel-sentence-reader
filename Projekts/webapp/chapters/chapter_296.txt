"The Dawn Cloudliner..."
Li Xuanxuan looked at the colorful glow in the sky, feeling uneasy. His second uncle, Li Tongya, had disappeared after the sacrificial ritual. Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators often meditated for years, so Li Xuanxuan could not find him immediately and could only wait.
Fortunately, a figure dressed in gray soon appeared before him. Li Tongya descended with a frown. He had planned to enter seclusion, but his wife Liu Rouxuan's health was deteriorating, forcing him to postpone his plans. Hence, he happened to witness this scene.
"It seems they are summoning people to Yi Mountain City at the southern border," Li Tongya commented as he stood midair with his sword. He had heard some information at Xiao Chuting's ceremony and now deduced the purpose of the Dawn Cloudliner.
After waiting in the air for a while, he saw someone approaching on a flying shuttle. The newcomer was dressed elegantly but had a rat-like face and shifty eyes that made him he look like he was up to no good.
The man landed at the formation entrance and shouted, "Juniors from the Li Family, I command you to open the formation right away!"
The crowd below was visibly enraged, but Li Tongya seemed thoughtful and calmly opened the formation, personally stepping forward to greet him. He said respectfully, "Li Family of Lijing welcomes the envoy!"
Seeing a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator personally greeting him, the man held back his arrogance and begrudgingly replied, "At least you have some sense."
He swaggered into the courtyard, glanced at the indignant members of the Li Family, and impatiently waved his sleeve, scolding, "You lot, get out! How can juniors be allowed to listen to our conversation?"
"You!" Li Xuanxuan looked rather upset, but Li Xuanling gave the man a sidelong glance like a serpent before leading his brothers away.
The man entered the courtyard with Li Tongya and cast a spell to seal their surroundings. He then straightened up, his demeanor changing abruptly, showing a hint of guilt as he bowed and said, "I am Deng Yuzhi. My earlier behavior was unavoidable. Please forgive me, Senior."
Li Tongya was taken aback by the sudden change but courteously replied, "Brother Deng, please rise. There is no need for such formalities. We did not take it to heart."
Deng Yuzhi spoke quickly and urgently, without giving Li Tongya a chance to respond.
"I am a member of the Deng Family, a subordinate family of the Azure Pond Peak. My elder brother Deng Qiuzhi and the Sword Immortal were close friends. They both perished at the southern border, devoured by a demon king. Do you know this, Senior?"
"I do."
Seeing Deng Yuzhi's anxiety, Li Tongya responded in a straightforward manner.
Deng Yuzhi nodded and said solemnly, "I'm glad you do, Senior. The sect disciple who came this time is Chi Zhiyan from the Chi Family. He is sinister and cruel. He already knows of the Sword Immortal's death… The Yu Family has also heard the news. Please be prepared, Senior."
Without waiting for Li Tongya's reply, Deng Yuzhi continued quickly, "Although my family's ancestor has never met you, he has heard many stories about you and holds you in high regard. Our families share similar circumstances. If you are willing, we can support each other in the future."
Li Tongya, resting his hand on his sword hilt, had an inscrutable expression. He asked softly, "I have a question for you. In the power struggles among the Purple Mansion Realm and Golden Core Realm cultivators in Jiangnan, what is the relationship between the Xiao Family and Azure Pond Sect?"
"They have a common enemy. Xiao Chuting wants to cultivate the Sexagenary Pit Water Thousand Slow Essence..." Deng Yuzhi said as he started his explanation.
However, Li Tongya waved his hand to interrupt him.
"I understand."
Deng Yuzhi nodded and continued, "Our Deng Family also has properties in Lixia Prefecture. If you have any further matters to discuss, feel free to send someone there. You are a prudent and steady person, I believe you understand the intricacies involved."
He handed over a small letter. Li Tongya scanned it with his spiritual sense and saw that it contained records of several alleys in Lixia Prefecture.
Seeing Li Tongya accept the letter, Deng Yuzhi exhaled deeply and said in a solemn voice, "There are people in the four prefectures spreading the word about your formidable Dao foundation and exceptional swordsmanship. It is likely done with intent. It is best for you to keep a low profile and not reveal your whereabouts."
This news surprised Li Tongya, causing him to ponder deeply. He nodded slightly, and Deng Yuzhi continued, "This time, the summons to Yi Mountain City includes Li Xuanfeng. We have no choice but to take your clan members... I hope you understand."
Li Tongya slowly closed his eyes and exhaled deeply. Li Xuanfeng was the only son of Li Xiangping and had no heirs. If something happened to him in Yi Mountain City, it would mean the end of that line. He was naturally unwilling and asked with a frown, "Xuanfeng is my brother's orphan. I am willing to go in his place. Is that possible...?"
Deng Yuzhi waved his hand, clearly and firmly refusing. He said bitterly, "I am merely surviving by doing others' bidding. Chi Zhiyan deeply envies the sword immortal. I have to put on a pretense just to be here. Naturally, I'm powerless to make any decisions..."
Li Tongya could only cover his face and sigh, replying, "I understand."
Deng Yuzhi did not linger and continued, "I must leave immediately with the person. If there is any offense, I ask for your forgiveness."
With that, he flung open his sleeves and kicked open the door. He called out in the courtyard, "Where is Li Xuanfeng?!"
In the lower courtyard, a group of anxious people stood. Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan looked up at him with unreadable expressions.
Li Xuanfeng, carrying his golden bow, stared directly at Deng Yuzhi and replied steadily, "Here!"
Deng Yuzhi sneered and said, "The Azure Pond Sect commands you to go to Yi Mountain City at the southern border to resist the demons. You are to leave immediately without delay."
Li Xuanfeng secured the golden bow on his back, and a smile formed on his scruffy chin as if he had heard something amusing. He laughed heartily and simply replied, "Very well."
Deng Yuzhi just tugged at him, saying, "Follow me."
Li Xuanfeng looked back at Li Tongya, who had walked out of the courtyard and bowed deeply. He then said to his brothers, Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling, "Please take care of the family affairs. No need to miss me."
This man, who had lost his parents in childhood and his wife in his youth, only uttered these few words. His eyes sparkled as if the years since the massacre of Lixia Prefecture had been dull, and now, facing the imminent battle and slaughter, he seemed excited and eager.
"Brother…" Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan began as they were still processing the news. However, Li Xuanfeng had already ridden the wind and followed Deng Yuzhi northward.
Li Xuanxuan finally came to his senses and called out hurriedly, "Second Uncle! This...!"
Li Tongya waved his sleeve, his face showing a painful expression as he said softly, "Resume your cultivation..."
The few of them exchanged glances, then lowered their heads and dispersed. The wedding was already nearing its end, and with the disruption of the Dawn Cloudliner, no one was in the mood to stay any longer. Guests began bidding their farewells and left.
After sending Li Yuanjiao and Xiao Guiluan to their bridal chamber, Mount Lijing returned to its usual quiet state, with only the mess left from the celebration hinting at the recent festivities.
It was not until the Dawn Cloudliner had flown past the horizon and its splendid glow faded away that the entire Moongaze Lake fell back into darkness and silence.
"Report to the envoy, everyone is here!"
Deng Yuzhi kneeled obsequiously before Chi Zhiyan, while Yu Mugao looked dazed as if lost in a nightmare. Chi Zhiyan's words still echoed in his mind.
"Yu Mugao, Yu Yufeng was killed by our Azure Pond Sect in collaboration with Xiao Chuting! This was also agreed upon by your own younger brother!"
"Muxian... personally agreed to it…?"
Yu Mugao's expression was one of pure bewilderment. He had exchanged dozens of letters with Yu Muxian, yet his brother had never mentioned this. Was it to avoid alarming anyone or because he did not trust Yu Mugao?
Suddenly, Yu Mugao felt a strange sense of unfamiliarity toward his own brother in the sect. He mumbled something indistinctly, and Chi Zhiyan, noticing his state, impatiently spat, "Stop practicing the Aged Courtly Path Scripture from now on!"
The group rode the wind back to the Dawn Cloudliner. The members of the Yu Family all kneeled, loudly bidding farewell. The intricate patterns on the ship brightened as it extended its radiant wings, flying toward the southeast.
Yu Mugao watched as the ship disappeared into the horizon. Only then did he slowly stand up, looking around at the silent crowd. He felt no shame for his earlier submissive behavior.
After a moment of silence, he said, "Jiang Heqian... It turns out to be an old grudge. Call back all our people from the eastern shore."
