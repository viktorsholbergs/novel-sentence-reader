"And the formation will also automatically record the quantity of spiritual medicines. If someone embezzles even one plant, the important figures of the Five Elements Sect will have to take action personally.
This rule is, of course, aimed at the people in the spiritual medicine garden. They don't want these people to seek opportunities outside the sect, like the foundational cultivators in the sect.
Many people who have gone out have been away for a hundred years or more, and some have even died outside. This rule is to protect their safety, but it can't be too strict to prevent any thoughts from getting through.
"If there is truly such a person, Chen Xun and the big black ox will not let him go!" Chen Xun said it firmly, with no other thoughts in his mind.
Upon hearing this, Zuo Yiying smiled faintly, "Then, Chen Xun junior, would you like to enter the spiritual medicine garden? I won't force you."
"Oh my God... this is quite a deep setup. One layer after another. The essence of blood has already been placed into the prohibition token. Now she's asking if I'm willing," Chen Xun silently complained.
"Senior Sister Zuo, I am willing, without regrets," Chen Xun bowed and said, but he hesitated a bit and said, stumbling, "But if our lifespan is about to end, we still won't be able to break through..."
"The sect will make arrangements for such individuals, and they can even be included in the sect's merit monument for future generations to admire," Zuo Yiying said, slowly sighing slightly. Who can resist the passage of time?
"Oh my God... that's not what I meant," Chen Xun said, shocked. Why is she talking about making arrangements for him? He and the big black ox are immortal!
Zuo Yiying, seeing Chen Xun's expression, added, "Of course, after handling all matters, you can also leave the sect on your own to resolve some regrets."
"Senior Sister Zuo, that's even better. I haven't married or had children yet," Chen Xun sighed deeply, as if he had completely relieved himself.
Zuo Yiying's expression twitched, "..."
"Senior Sister Zuo..."
"Chen junior, please speak."
"In the sect's spiritual medicine garden, do we have any benefits every year?" Chen Xun looked at her hopefully. After talking for so long, he didn't mention the treatment. They're not greedy; 300 contributions will do.
"Moo~~" The big black ox also softly called out, looking at Zuo Yiying with a hopeful expression. In fact, they both care the most about this.
"Benefits?" Zuo Yiying looked at Chen Xun and the black cattle with a puzzled expression. "You mean an annual stipend?"
Chen Xun nodded and bowed, even licking his lips. They are really poor, and now's not the right time to sell spiritual medicines.
Zuo Yiying suddenly understood, shook her head, and chuckled lightly. Chen junior is quite interesting. She said, "Of course, foundational disciples are considered true members of the Five Elements Sect. The sect will never mistreat its own people."
"Foundational disciples not only have access to important matters within the sect but can also receive 500 sect contributions each year, and even more if they have a position."
"The Contribution Hall of the sect will open up more exchange items for foundational disciples, including various inheritance items of the sect. If they make significant contributions, they also have a chance to exchange for them."
"However, for those who join the sect halfway as foundational cultivators, they won't enjoy these benefits. Most of them serve as guest disciples of the sect."
Zuo Yiying explained, watching Chen Xun in the central hall with a slightly speechless expression.
At this moment, he was looking at her affectionately, and even this spirit beast was well-behaved. Their eyes were moist, and Chen Xun called out loudly, "We will serve the sect wholeheartedly!"
"Moo, moo, moo!" The big black ox also lowered its bull head, deeply moved in its heart. They could have talked about this earlier, and there was no need to go through all of this.
Zuo Yiying suddenly became solemn and looked at the big black ox. She took out a clear and bright pill from her storage bag and said, "This is a Spirit Beast Foundational Pill, although it's not as precious as the Foundational Pill, it's not easy to refine."
Both Chen Xun and the big black ox were shocked. What did she mean by this?
"This is a gift from the Alchemy Hall to congratulate Chen Xun junior on becoming a foundational disciple, but your contributions for the next ten years will belong to the hall."
"Senior Sister Zuo, this pill is very important to us. Junior won't refuse," Chen Xun said with a serious expression, stepping forward to accept the pill from the air, and he bowed earnestly, "Thanks to the Alchemy Hall for their kindness. Chen Xun will never forget it."
"Moo, moo!!" The big black ox also thanked in all directions. Its question had actually troubled Chen Xun for a long time, causing him sleepless nights. They had even prepared for the worst.
Zuo Yiying nodded silently, a hint of satisfaction in her eyes. Chen Xun's words came from the heart, without any pretense. The sect would spare no resources for talented individuals.
Most of the people managing the sect's spiritual medicine garden were reclusive; some kept turtles, some kept fish, and some also kept spirit beasts. These seemed to be their last spiritual sustenance, just to avoid drifting on the path of cultivation.
The Five Elements Sect, with its long history, had long known how to retain those who practiced the Water Spirit Technique. The important figures of the ten major sects were even more adept at this. For example, their descendants were directly taught by Golden Core-stage senior cultivators.
Established sects operated on a vast system and had to balance various aspects. It wasn't just about fighting and competing in magic battles.
"Ruan Zheng Junior Brother," Zuo Yiying called lightly and released her spiritual power, spreading her consciousness.
Chen Xun and the big black ox suddenly felt a tingling sensation on their scalps. The power of this formidable spiritual consciousness was far beyond what they had experienced at the early foundational stage.
This spiritual consciousness could easily break through various disguises. Even their head coverings wouldn't work against it unless they had items that could shield against spiritual consciousness. Otherwise, nothing could hide from it.
The more powerful the spiritual consciousness, the more it could seize the initiative in magic battles. However, foundational stage magic battles were intense, requiring vast amounts of mana, and most often, spiritual consciousness was used for exploration and assistance.
One common knowledge in the cultivation world was that spiritual consciousness couldn't be cultivated to increase its power; it naturally grew with the improvement of one's cultivation level. Cultivators at the same level had nearly identical spiritual strength of consciousness .
The foundational stage underwent a transformation in life realms, far different from the Qi Refining stage. The powerful mana shield and the strengthening of various foundational energies at the time of foundational cultivation had already surpassed the abilities of Qi Refining disciples.
The higher the realm one fought in, the more Chen Xun understood that it was a distant dream. The disparities in such higher realms would only grow larger as their cultivation levels increased.
"Senior Sister Zuo," Ruan Zheng strolled over casually. He had white hair, a flowing white beard, a ruddy complexion, and a simple dress. He also carried a fairy sword on his back.
"You take Chen Xun Junior Brother to get familiar with the Alchemy Hall."
After Zuo Yiying finished speaking, she looked at Chen Xun and said, "Three days from now, you can activate the prohibition token and go to the spiritual medicine garden. It won't delay your duty report at the sect's main hall."
"Yes, Senior Sister Zuo."
"Yes, Senior Sister Zuo."
Both of them bowed and then left the side hall with the big black ox.
Outside the Alchemy Hall, numerous disciples were coming and going. When they saw Chen Xun and Ruan Zheng, they all greeted them as senior uncles. Chen Xun also had a taste of being a senior, making the big black ox envy him.
"Chen Junior Brother, do you have an interest in alchemy?"
"Well... I have some knowledge."
"Haha, that's great! I'm sure Junior Brother knows about these foundational spiritual medicines."
"Yes... I've heard of them."
Chen Xun smiled awkwardly, feeling somewhat at a loss. "Senior Brother, actually, I'm going to the spiritual medicine garden, not for alchemy practice."
"What?!" Ruan Zheng, stroking his white beard, was shocked, "Chen Junior Brother, you've just broken through. Why would you go to that desolate spiritual medicine garden where there isn't even anyone? How will you make a breakthrough in the sect?"
"Senior Brother, to be honest, I've already cultivated the Water Spirit Technique to the second level. I can only contribute to the sect in this way," Chen Xun said with a slight smile, appreciating Ruan Zheng's good intentions.
"But you shouldn't give up; if you choose to practice alchemy..."
Ruan Zheng paused at this point. Zuo Yiying had just walked out from behind them, her face frosty, and was looking at Ruan Zheng.
"In fact, the spiritual medicine garden is also good. It has a long history, and there are spiritual veins underground. It's the birthplace of countless spiritual medicines and has benefited many cultivators of our Five Elements Sect."
Ruan Zheng looked solemn, his hands behind his back, and slowly said, "It is also a tranquil place, which I believe will greatly benefit Chen Junior Brother's cultivation."
