The spiritual energy in the mountains had also diminished compared to the past. They could now clearly sense the subtle changes in the spiritual energy.
Chen Xun and the big black ox walked openly on the mountain path, not wearing sect robes. Their divine senses were already spread out.
“Old Ox, why are there only four Golden Core cultivators in the sect, and one of them is at the mid-Golden Core stage?” Chen Xun raised his brows and looked around, “But it seems there are many more Foundation Establishment cultivators.”
“Moo!” The big black ox was also using its divine sense to scan the surroundings, sensing the fluctuations of spiritual energy in the mountains.
“Damn!”
“Moo!”
They both exclaimed in shock. In the center of a spiritual peak, there were many ordinary people without spiritual roots, as well as government buildings.
The Ji Residence!
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged a glance and transformed into a wisp of light, heading towards the spiritual peak.
The Ji Residence was quite impressive, with many servants coming and going. Some Qi Refining stage disciples guarded the surroundings. Even when ordinary people from the Ji family passed by, they were exceptionally respectful.
Chen Xun furrowed his brows slightly, enveloping the Ji Residence with his divine sense, various sounds reaching his mind.
In a luxurious room, a middle-aged man was sitting in the main seat, enjoying tea. He was the current head of the Ji family, Ji Dingren.
Next to him sat a young master with an arrogant demeanor, Ji Yan, the eldest son of the Ji family.
“Father, those immortals seem to look down on us mortals.” Ji Yan said with a hint of sarcasm, “The immortals from the Five Elements Sect don’t even want to form Dao partners with us.”
“Heh, which immortal are you interested in?”
“Of course, it’s the one from the Liu family, Liu Han. Father, she has just embarked on the path of immortality. I still have a chance.”
Ji Yan’s eyes were filled with fervor. Liu Han was the treasured jewel of the Liu family, and her appearance was exceptional. Even those immortals had praised her talent.
If he could become her Dao partner, he would be the envy of many, and even those Foundation Establishment immortals would not dare look down on him.
“Ji Yan, I think you’re quite audacious!”
**Bang!**
Ji Dingren’s face darkened with rage. He slammed his teacup onto the table: “You dare to think about the Liu family?!”
“Father!” Ji Yan was startled and immediately knelt on the ground, sweating profusely.
“Even though our families are old friends, how can the Liu family, which has produced so many immortals, be compared to our Ji family?” Ji Dingren’s beard quivered with anger, and the tea on the table kept flowing down. “Don’t even think about this matter.”
“Father, if you personally go to their doorstep, with the old ancestor’s remaining prestige, how could the Liu family not agree?” Ji Yan pleaded desperately while kneeling, not willing to give up. “Moreover, those influential immortals are leaning towards our Ji family.”
Ji Dingren’s brows twitched at the mention of the old ancestor, and he felt a bit flustered.
“Father?” Ji Yan looked up at him, puzzled by his strange expression.
“It has been so many years; the old ancestor should not be coming back.” Ji Dingren spoke with an inexplicable tone, “Ji Yan, our bloodline of cultivators is thin. Don’t harbor any more fantasies about the Liu family.”
Ji Yan’s eyes darted around, thinking of the people in the back courtyard of the Ji Residence, feeling a heavy heart.
“Understood, Father. But we still need to expand our family, or how can our Ji family embark on the path of immortality? We must marry an immortal from the Five Elements Sect.”
“Hmm, I will consider this matter.” Ji Dingren’s expression was grave. He waved his hand and said, “You may leave for now.”
“Yes.” Ji Yan was delighted, quickly stood up to adjust his robes, and walked out with a proud demeanor.
The room was left with only Ji Dingren, who sighed deeply.
“This matter cannot be blamed on us. It was the previous generations’ power struggles that reduced the descendants of the old ancestor to a branch... It’s not our fault that their descendants dwindled. Old ancestor, we can’t be blamed for this.” Ji Dingren muttered to himself. Back then, the Five Elements Sect had even brought in distant relatives of the Ji family.
But the Five Elements Sect treated everyone equally. They aimed to pass on the old ancestor’s bloodline, which led to these distant, poor relatives becoming increasingly powerful.
There were even people who had forcibly changed their surname to Ji, which was quite absurd. The old ancestor's family, Ji Kun’s, only numbered a few dozen. His parents had long since passed away, leaving only ordinary mortals behind.
They were so elated by their good fortune that they lacked a broader vision and didn’t think about other possibilities. Before they knew it, they had been deprived of power. The thoughts of ordinary people are also quite heavy.
Now, hundreds of years later, the direct descendants have completely forgotten about it.
At present, the Five Elements Sect only knows about the Ji family and the old ancestor, and they don’t care about the branch families. In any case, they don’t mistreat anyone.
“Oh? There’s such a thing, and it happens to the descendants of Brother Ji.” A calm voice came, and suddenly, a person and an ox appeared in the room, both with cold expressions.
“Ah?!” Ji Dingren was startled, rising and trembling. “Who… who are you, daring to intrude into the Ji Residence?!”
Even a Foundation Establishment immortal would have to visit them courteously when entering the Ji Residence.
“Truly, ignorance breeds fearlessness.” Chen Xun did not wish to waste words. A surge of immense spiritual energy shook the mountains and the major peaks, causing the earth to quake and the mountains to tremble!
“Truly, ignorance breeds fearlessness.”
“Truly, ignorance breeds fearlessness.”
…
The vast sound reverberated everywhere. The disciples from various peaks were alarmed, the Liu family was startled, the Shi family was surprised, and the Foundation Establishment cultivators and the four Golden Core cultivators abruptly opened their eyes, their eyelids twitching.
In the sky, between the peaks, rainbow lights flashed, and figures rushed towards the Ji Residence with intense whistling sounds.
_Could it be… that those two have returned?!_
At this moment, Ji Yan was showing off in the residence when he heard this tremendous sound. Suddenly, he felt weak all over, collapsed to the ground, his pupils shrinking to pinpricks, and was stunned.
_What’s going on…_
A group of Ji family members in the back courtyard trembled, also kneeling on the ground. They were the true descendants of Ji Kun, yet they were treated so differently.
They had been deceived into thinking they had no chance of reaching the path of immortality, as if they were confined within the residence, and felt it was only natural.
Although they lived a life of ease and comfort, even stepping outside the residence was difficult. They felt it was only right, thinking the outside world was full of dangerous immortals.
**Roar!**
**Roar!**
A roar of fury shook the heavens. The big black ox’s eyes blazed with anger at how the direct descendants of Brother Ji were treated!
They floated into the air, standing above the Ji Residence, scanning the many arriving cultivators.
“Senior, you are…” A Golden Core cultivator in the distance clasped his hands and asked, his eyes filled with excitement. This spiritual energy fluctuation was undoubtedly from a Nascent Soul ancestor.
“It is indeed me, here to have a look.”
Chen Xun’s gaze was icy as he looked at the people in the Ji Residence. The Ji family members on the ground had already lost control, unable to withstand the pressure of the Nascent Soul ancestor’s presence.
Chen Xun and the big black ox’s overwhelming aura surged like a tidal wave, shaking like an ancient mountain, making everyone there feel like they were underwater, almost suffocating.
As these words were spoken.
The entire scene fell into silence, so quiet that a pin drop could be heard. The wind seemed to have stopped. The disciples from various sects stared in shock, their hearts pounding. The legendary figures had indeed returned…
“Greetings, Ancestor!!”
“Greetings, Ancestor!!”
“Greetings, Ancestor!!”
In an instant, the Five Elements Sect was filled with a huge uproar. All the cultivators bowed and clasped their hands in reverence, no one daring to look up, their eyes filled with intense awe.
