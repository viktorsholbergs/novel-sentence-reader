The Monster’s Intrusion
* * *
<<<Aaaaah!? What the hell are you!? You wanna fight, huh!?>>>
The first ones to rush at the monster who suddenly appeared at the resting place, swinging their humps while glaring at it, were a young Red Kobu warrior and his followers.
<<<H-Hey… You idiots! Get back, all of you!!>>>
Kobdaroze hurriedly tried to stop them, but they wouldn’t listen.
On the contrary, they even scoffed at Kobdaroze, calling him a ‘coward’.
They weren’t part of the battle where Kobdaroze and the others fought this monster.
Moreover, they’re hot-blooded young Kobudai… and they tend to overestimate their own abilities.
Furthermore, they harbor a childish rivalry towards Kobdaroze, who was chosen as one of the “Ten Warriors of the Red Kobu” over them…
Therefore, they didn’t understand the true threat of the monster, and had no intention of obeying Kobdaroze’s words.
On the contrary, a reckless ambition burned in their hearts: ‘I’ll defeat the monster that Kobdaroze ran away from, and become a “true Ten Warrior”’.
<<<That creepy monsterーーー!!>>>
<<<Dieeeeーーー!!>>>
So, to them, the monster in front of them is nothing more than a target to be defeated…
They surrounded the monster, without even trying to communicate… and attacked her from all sides!
<<<Take thiiisーーー!!>>>
Their battle formation… is 【Water Vortex Formation】!
An attack like a swirling vortex of water, instantly tearing the enemy to shreds, a terrifying combination technique!
It’s a sure-kill attack… that these young Red Kobu warriors are absolutely confident in!
But…!
“…………”
This monster, as always, without making a single sound…
Didn’t even glance at the Red Kobu warriors surrounding her…
She casually extended a single tentacle from her shoulder… and then…
<<<UOOOOOOOOOHーーー!!!>>>
Towards the surrounding Red Kobu warriors, roaring…
SWISH!!!
With such speed that the sound of cutting wind could only be heard a moment later.
Spinning in a circle.
She swung the tentacle horizontally.
And just like that, the roars were cut short, and silence filled the air.
The young Kobudai who were about to attack the monster were all sliced vertically in two… and died.
Plop, plop.
The sashimi, which used to be Kobudai, fell onto the bedrock at her feet, revealing their beautiful white flesh.
<<<Eh…?>>>
Among those young Kobudai, there was one…
…Who was late in joining the 【Water Vortex Formation】.
Because he was late, his body was outside the monster’s attack range.
So he was lucky enough to survive.
<<<Eh…?>>>
But he could only freeze, unable to comprehend the carnage around him.
If he had been able to run away… he might have had a different future…
But he couldn’t.
The next moment…
Thump!!
His body was pierced by a tentacle, shot out like a spear with tremendous force, turning him into Kobudai tataki (lightly seared sashimi).
The tentacle extended upwards from the monster’s shoulder, and then shot down diagonally.
The tentacle pierced through the young Kobudai… or rather, its force was so strong that it practically exploded his body, sending it flying, and then it hit the bedrock, creating a small crater.
“…………”
The monster tilted her head, looking at the scene.
Because the piercing attack from her tentacle had dealt more damage to the enemy than expected.
She kills to eat.
If the prey’s body is blown away, the edible parts are reduced, which is a problem.
And the reason for the unexpected power, it is because she herself doesn’t fully grasp her rapidly increasing strength.
“…………”
The monster extended several more tentacles, swinging them around and stabbing them into the ground, as if to test them.
<<<…All forces!! All forces, advanceーーー!!!>>>
Now, among all the Kobudai who were shocked by the monster’s sudden appearance, the first to regain his senses was Kobdalian, the young Clan Chief of the Red Kobu Tribe!
He shouted, giving orders to the entire army, while the monster was swinging her tentacles around!
<<<O-Oh!>>>
<<<Don’t fight the monster! Don’t mistake your enemy!>>>
<<<Advance! Advanceーーー!!>>>
The Red Kobu Tribe, as expected of a group with many veteran warriors, quickly recovered from their mental shock, stopped resting, and started advancing, following Kobdalian’s instructions!
<<<Tch! This wasn’t part of the plan…! Blue Kobu Tribe, follow the Red Kobu Tribeーーー!!>>>
Kobdacleva, the Clan Chief of the Blue Kobu Tribe, also regained his composure and shouted at the Blue Kobu warriors, uncharacteristically for a sage, as he himself hurriedly distanced himself from the monster.
Their retreat route is blocked by the monster.
There’s no choice but to move forward!
<<<Now then.>>>
Kobdalian, feeling the presence of the Red and Blue Kobudai Allied Forces moving behind him, faced the monster.
<<<I am… ‘Kobdalian of the Raging Flames’! The proud Clan Chief of the Red Kobu Tribe!>>>
He then introduced himself and unleashed his 【Intimidation】!
The air crackled, unable to withstand Kobdalian’s immense magical power!
“…………”
But the monster was unfazed by such 【Intimidation】.
She did glance at Kobdalian, who was telepathically communicating with her at a loud volume, but she continued to swing her tentacles around with an expressionless face, picking up the flesh of the Kobudai warriors scattered nearby and munching on it.
<<<They may have been rude… but they’re still part of my clan! Monster! You’ll pay for killing them!!!>>>
Kobdalian, facing the monster, used 【Body Strengthening】 to its limit… and started swimming with all his might, about to charge!
But!!
<<<You idiotーーー!!>>>
Someone body-slammed Kobdalian from the side, stopping his charge!
<<<Gah, gah… Ow…!?>>>
Kobdalian, caught off guard by the sudden attack, rolled on the ground, coughing.
In his vision, he saw the back of a single Kobudai, standing as if to protect him from the monster.
It’s his older sister figure from when he was a child.
One of the formidable Ten Warriors of the Red Kobu!
‘Kobdaroze, the Crusher’!!
<<<What are you doing…? >>>
<<<I should be the one asking you that!? I’ll be your shield! Clan Chief, you need to catch up to the main force and lead them!!>>>
Kobdaroze shouted back at Kobdalian, who protested!
<<<Don’t worry, I’ll protect you. Because I am…>>>
And then, Kobdaroze said, turning back to look at Kobdalian…
<<<…Your ‘Onee-chan’… remember!!>>>
Smiling at him… he took Kobdalian’s place… and fiercely charged… towards the monster!!
