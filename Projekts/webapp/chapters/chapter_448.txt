"Can my family benefit from this?" Li Xuanxuan asked, his heart pounding with anticipation. He was wary of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' schemes but also intrigued by the potential gains.
"The Dongli Sect was once a prominent immortal sect. Putting aside the treasures inside the grotto heaven, even the spirit water, spirit fire, and spiritual qi outside it are all exceedingly rare," he remarked softly.
"Could we send a few guest or external cultivators to the area around the cave to compete with the rogue cultivators? If we manage to obtain one or two of the treasures, it would greatly benefit our family's future development!"
Li Qinghong, listening to his proposal, raised an eyebrow.
"It's difficult to say. If you really want to involve our family, whether you send guest or external cultivators, it's essentially the same as sending our direct descendants," she replied.
She continued, "Moreover, these guest or external cultivators who acquire some spirit water or spirit fire won't simply hand it over. They'd more likely escape with it…"
Li Xuanxuan was at a loss for words until Li Qinghong added, "Of course, we shouldn't risk our family members' lives. Even though Chu Yi has entered the grotto heaven, who can guarantee the rest could leave safely after harvesting the resources outside? They might be dead upon reaching Mount Dongli… The rogue cultivators don't have much to lose; they're simply looking for a chance. But…our family is a different story."
After a few moments of thought, Li Qinghong spoke softly, "While our family can't afford to risk entering Mount Dongli, there are plenty who are willing to take the risk. If hawks can't risk it, perhaps we can benefit from the sparrows."
She pulled out a map from her storage pouch and pointed to Mount Dongli.
"Mount Dongli is located on the border of Yufu, surrounded by large prefectures to the northwest. Fleeing there would be unwise. If the rogue cultivators find the treasure and leave the mountain, they will likely head east, not northwest.
"East is the best direction to flee, toward the loosely controlled territory of the Purple Smoke Gate. Given that the Purple Smoke Gate is weak and preoccupied with dividing the treasure in the grotto heaven, their territory is sparsely guarded due to a shortage of manpower..."
Li Qinghong concluded confidently, "If I were a rogue cultivator with the treasure, I would definitely flee east, leave the Purple Smoke territory, and travel along the edge of Shanji Prefecture. I'd hide my identity in the Eastern Sea and establish a Dao lineage…"
Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard and fell silent for a moment before whispering, "Are you suggesting we ambush them in the territory of the Purple Smoke Gate?"
"No," Li Qinghong replied with an excited smile, "It's better to position ourselves at the mouth of the river. The Purple Smoke Gate is too close to Mount Dongli, it's too dangerous there. I'll use the mirror to scout the river. With its ability to see thousands of miles away, no Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator will be able to catch me, and no Qi Cultivator will be able to defeat me."
"Right now, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' attention is focused on Mount Dongli. The entrance to the sea is winding and difficult under the rule of the Yue Cultivating Sect. We can wait nearby. If we're lucky, we'll profit. If not, it's no great loss—just a matter of waiting for a few days."
The plan seemed reasonable to Li Xuanxuan, but his advanced age and frailty had drained his courage, worn thin by past trials. He tried to speak but remained silent.
Understanding his hesitation, Li Qinghong pursed her lips and refrained from speaking further.
Uncle Xuanxuan is quite old and has faced death several times. He must be weary and likely has little desire for further risks…
Li Qinghong thought for a moment before Li Xuanxuan finally spoke.
"Jiao'er is in seclusion, and his fate is uncertain. If something were to happen, it could spell disaster for the family. Moreover, it may not be wise to use our family's resources for such a distant venture."
"Alright, I will heed your advice," Li Qinghong replied, smiling with disappointment.
"But there's no rush. I've heard that the grotto heaven hasn't been opened yet. Many are still waiting…" she added while cupping her fist. Just as she was about to withdraw, the calm surface of the courtyard's clear water suddenly rippled. A wind swept in, dispersing the dark clouds overhead.
Rumble!
A muffled sound resonated from the clear sky, and the sky darkened abruptly. The water in the courtyard leaped up from the ground, disappearing into the cracks and fissures.
"Brother! Big Brother has made a breakthrough!"
Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned as the cave's stone door swung open with a gust of strong wind, stirring up a grayish-green water mist. Li Xuanxuan stood up with excitement and moved forward a few steps.
Indeed, a young man in black emerged from the gray mist, carrying a sword on his back. He stepped forward with a beaming smile, his face radiant with joy.
"I have formed the Boundless Ocean!"
Li Yuanjiao's voice was unusually cheerful. The emotions he had suppressed for years finally surfaced, and he felt a surge of confidence this time.
Looking at his father and younger cousin in the courtyard, he smiled and announced, "I have established the immortal foundation and am now a cultivator in the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm!"
Li Xuanxuan laughed heartily. He stepped forward and said with genuine happiness, "Of course, I knew it was only a matter of time before Jiao'er established his foundation! With this new strength, there are many things we can now attempt that we previously avoided!"
Li Yuanjiao shook his head slightly, his face showing a hint of relief. Reflecting on the trials he had faced during his seclusion, a cold sweat broke out on his back. He replied, "Father, you speak lightly, but it wasn't easy. I narrowly escaped death... If not for my good fortune and youth, I might not have survived this life-or-death ordeal."
Li Xuanxuan had seen several elders establish their foundation relatively easily and assumed that Li Yuanjiao's success was assured. He had not expected his son to look as though he had survived a great trial.
He responded, puzzled, "How could it be so difficult? If even you faced such challenges, how many in the family could hope to establish their foundation?"
"Not many," Li Yuanjiao replied as he continued, "Father, never underestimate the difficulty of establishing a foundation… Just look at how many from the Fei and Yu families died trying to achieve it."
Li Qinghong, who had been listening, appeared unfazed. She smiled at her brother and asked, "How does it feel, Brother? How different are you from my grandfather back then?"
Li Yuanjiao's smile faded, and he became serious.
"That's exactly what I'm wondering…"
With that, he slowly extended his hand. His black robe fluttered gently in the wind as the immortal foundation within him began to resonate and the sound of a rushing waterfall filled the air.
Splash!
The gray spring water surged from between the floor tiles and rock crevices. It spiraled around the feet of the three, wrapping around Li Yuanjiao's robe. The water swiftly transformed into a serpent dragon that bared its fangs and claws, its scales clearly defined as it coiled beside him.
Li Yuanjiao murmured, "The immortal foundation I formed doesn't possess the ability to condense talisman water, but I've acquired another ability known as Serpent Dragon's Water Wisdom…
He continued, his expression unusual, "This ability allows me to communicate with water beasts, befriend underwater monsters, control clouds, and rain, and activate water veins…"
Li Qinghong was momentarily stunned as a word suddenly popped into her mind. She exclaimed suddenly, "Jing Dragon King?!"
