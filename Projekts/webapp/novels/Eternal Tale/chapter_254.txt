The Great Li Realm, Feiyun Prefecture.
This prefecture is one of the prominent territories governed by the Yu family, thriving and prosperous, and known for frequently producing remarkable talents who shine brightly. Each major city is orderly, bustling with people, and adorned everywhere with the Yu family’s banners. The Yu family’s influence touches every industry, and even some of the major sects have Yu family disciples among their ranks.
Mount Dangmo.
In the distance, clouds coil around lush, layered mountains. From a vantage point overlooking the mountain base, one sees an expanse of green trees and grass, with occasional flowers adding splashes of color—a perfect place for cultivating both mind and body.
The spiritual energy here is immense as if converging from the entire prefecture’s ley lines. Mysterious and profound, the mountain itself is covered in intricate mystical patterns.
This mountain is the Yu family’s forbidden ground, where the clan’s ancestors enter seclusion. No one may enter without a summons.
The grand formation covering this majestic mountain range stretches across the landscape. At the mountain’s foot are numerous caves, reserved for the core disciples of the Yu family to cultivate, giving the area a tranquil and silent atmosphere.
Today, a divine light burst forth from the summit of Mount Dangmo, with a powerful aura so overwhelming it seemed to suffocate. An ancient, solemn palace appeared before the world.
“Yu Jingxin, you acted recklessly.”
“Those three lack any traceable origins and could bring calamity upon the Yu family. Do you understand?”
Two deep voices emanated from the ancient hall, void of emotion, pressing toward the young man standing outside.
Dressed in a pristine white robe, his face as flawless as jade, his limbs as fair as snow, and his features exceedingly handsome, he wore a faint, charming smile. Every movement exuded elegance—a refined and scholarly man.
In noble families, those who reach the Nascent Soul stage are regarded as brothers, as seniority becomes less important in such a high cultivation realm.
If the eldest brother passes away, the second will naturally take the title of eldest. Among family members, this is how Nascent Soul cultivators address each other.
Yu Jingxin kept his smile, bowing slightly. “My two elder brothers may not be aware. Those three are no more than late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, yet they roam freely in the Forbidden Sea. I truly could not let this chance slip by.”
“If you intervened personally, why couldn’t even Nascent Soul cultivators be detained?”
“Their strength exceeded my expectations. There’s a formation expert among them, which I didn’t account for.” Yu Jingxin sighed softly. “But if we had captured them, what we would gain in the Forbidden Sea would far surpass any losses.”
“Eldest brother, third brother has a point. Anyone capable of such feats in the Forbidden Sea must possess an extraordinary secret.” Someone else in the ancient hall spoke up, calm and collected. “But for Nascent Soul cultivators to escape the grasp of a Nascent Soul expert is difficult to imagine.”
“The third brother has already acted. This enmity is now set, and it’s too late to change it.” The voice of the eldest brother from within the hall was cold, devoid of any emotion. “Instruct the Yu family members outside to remain cautious. If any trace is found, I will act personally to eliminate this potential threat.”
“Eldest brother?”
“If their strength is truly so formidable, the great secret of the Forbidden Sea cannot be ignored. We understand the situation now. Third brother, you were too careless.”
The voice from the ancient hall bore a hint of disapproval. After spending so long at the Nascent Soul stage, one could inevitably grow dismissive of others, yet this was the demon nest of the Forbidden Sea.
“Eldest brother, second brother, you may not know. Those three are exceedingly cautious, leaving no trace of their presence.” Yu Jingxin’s eyes held a peculiar gleam, his gaze tinged with frustration. “I delayed them as long as I could, but they are not ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators. One lapse was bound to occur.”
Silence fell within the ancient hall. They fully understood the sequence of events; to handle three Nascent Soul cultivators, the third brother had prepared sufficiently and did not underestimate them.
Nonetheless, they believed Yu Jingxin was too impulsive and made a grave mistake, though capturing those three could indeed bring enormous benefits to the Yu family.
“Third brother, go and prepare. This matter won’t end so easily.”
“Rest assured, eldest and second brothers. I will handle this fully and ensure the family faces no calamity.” Yu Jingxin’s eyes hardened. “Transmission arrays have been set up on all islands near the Forbidden Sea, with Yu family members as bait. If they dare to show themselves, we won’t let them escape again.”
“Understood.” A calm voice echoed from within the ancient hall, “I will discuss this matter with the Jiang family patriarch and prepare for the worst.”
Yu Jingxin’s brows furrowed, as if unwilling to accept that he had been thwarted by mere Nascent Soul cultivators. With a gentle sweep of his robe, he vanished from the scene.
After he left, the voices within the ancient hall resumed:
“Eldest brother, if those three in the Forbidden Sea break through to the Nascent Soul stage…”
“That’s why we need to contact the Jiang family. If they cannot be suppressed, we may have to ally with them. But how could one possibly achieve a breakthrough to Nascent Soul in the Forbidden Sea?”
“So, eldest brother, you think they’ll eventually come out, likely heading toward the Inverted Sky Pass overseas.”
“I’ll send a message to that figure in Immortal Mountain; they’ll assist us when the time comes.”
The voices gradually faded until they were no longer audible. The eldest brother would have to resolve the trouble the third brother had caused, ensuring there was always a way forward for the sake of the family.
The secrets of the Forbidden Sea were also a strategic focus of The Great Li Realm’s major factions, and they couldn’t afford to let others know about this matter. They had already imposed a strict silence order.
…
Lingwu City.
A refined young man strolled down the street, holding a white paper fan, trailed by two maidservants. This was none other than Yu Jingxin.
He walked leisurely, casually taking in the sights. Although he did not display his cultivation level, his extraordinary presence drew the attention of passing women, who stole glances at him with flushed cheeks.
Suddenly, a young woman appeared in front of him, her eyes full of warmth, glancing at him.
“Greetings, Patriarch.”
“The plan is already underway. The appearance of those three is rather timely.”
With a smile on his lips, Yu Jingxin continued to stroll down the street, moving gradually away from her, though they continued communicating via voice transmission.
“Do the other two have any suspicions?”
The woman reached a nearby stall, picked up a trinket, and teasingly cast a glance at the vendor. “Patriarch, your actions in this matter left a few gaps.”
“Oh?”
“How could a Nascent Soul elder act so casually that Nascent Soul cultivators could escape from you?”
“Haha, they were indeed something different. They genuinely escaped.” Yu Jingxin waved his paper fan, lips closed in a slight smile. “But if they lacked such skill, they’d be unworthy as my chess pieces.”
“I see, so the Patriarch was prepared from the start.”
“If I had struck recklessly and subdued them, the secrets of the Forbidden Sea would already be ours.”
Yu Jingxin raised his brows, glancing toward a nearby tavern as he made his way toward it. “But if they managed to escape, the Yu family alone would suffer; there’s no mistaking their strength.”
“It seems the Patriarch was ready from the very beginning. I am in awe.” The woman lifted her head, also heading toward a tea house, “What does the Patriarch need us to do?”
“They’re likely considering one of two outcomes: either kill me or destroy the Yu family.”
Yu Jingxin seated himself by the window on the second floor of the tavern, eyes deep. “I’ve set up a killing formation in my cave, waiting for them. But I’ll need two others to watch alongside me.”
“I understand. I’ll return and inform the elders.” The woman also seated herself by the window, resting her chin in her hand with a dreamy look in her eyes. “It seems the Patriarch is still unwilling to give up the secrets of the Forbidden Sea.”
“Heh, naturally. According to Yu Chen, their massive vessel seems to be related to an ancient warship.” Yu Jingxin looked out the window at the drifting clouds, “If the Yu family makes a move, my two elder brothers will have to intervene. Serving as bait, I cannot leave the family.”
“Patriarch, you’re truly…” The woman covered her mouth in a soft laugh, leaving her thoughts unfinished. “Everything seems irrational, yet perfectly reasonable. Full of flaws, but ultimately flawless.”
Yu Jingxin smiled without responding. Deploying numerous Yu family disciples was merely a distraction, meant to make the world see his apparent struggle and the strength of those three.
