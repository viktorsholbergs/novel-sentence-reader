Yuan Tuan had just finished speaking when Li Ximing stepped forward, drawing everyone's attention. He wore loose white robes and appeared quite dignified though his voice still sounded somewhat immature.
"Junior Li Ximing greets Senior!"
Yuan Tuan looked at him carefully, the long ribbon at her waist gently fluttering. She smiled and said, "I heard from my senior brother that there is an alchemist with a harmonious aura, blending together both water and fire. Now that I see you, you are indeed a fine seedling!"
With that, she took Li Ximing's hand and asked warmly, "Do you have a suitable alchemy furnace, Ming'er?"
Li Ximing was slightly taken aback and looked at Li Yuanjiao, who gave a slight nod before he replied, "Yes, Senior! I already have one!"
The Li Family's alchemy furnace had been taken by Li Tongya from someone else when the market fell many years ago, and it was at the Qi Cultivation Realm. At that time, the Li Family was still weak, and Li Tongya feared that possessing such a treasure would bring trouble, hence it had been sealed away for many years.
Now that the Li Family's foundation was stable and they had an alchemist, the furnace finally saw the light of day, though its presence was known only to a few direct descendants.
Upon hearing this, Yuan Tuan paused as she rubbed her storage pouch at her waist, sensing the alchemy furnace inside. She could not help but laugh bitterly to herself.
This is awkward. I have owed Yundan Peak a favor for nothing...
The Li Family had only been established for less than a hundred years, so Yuan Tuan did not expect them to have an alchemy furnace ready. She thought for a moment, then took off a jade bead from her wrist which was tied with a red string, and put it around Li Ximing's wrist. She then smiled warmly.
"Consider this my gift to you, Ming'er!"
Li Yuanjiao noticed the brilliant radiance of the jade bead and knew instantly that it was no ordinary item. He was delighted but quickly said modestly, "Peak Master! How can we accept this?!"
Yuan Tuan laughed, looking at Li Ximing's serious little face, liking him more and more. She then explained, "This item was my protective treasure during my years as a Qi Cultivator, and it is called Azure Manifestation. It has been tempered by my cultivation method for many years and possesses some spiritual abilities. It can transform into an eagle, dog, tiger, or deer, making it an excellent dharma artifact for those at the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms.
"Now that I have achieved the immortal foundation, Azure Crest Manifestation, and nurtured it for two years, it has become even more miraculous, almost a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact… The abilities of Azure Crest Manifestation overlap with this item, so I no longer need it and so I will give it to Ming'er!"
Li Yuanjiao could tell that Yuan Tuan had originally intended to give an alchemy furnace as a favor, but now that she had given the jade bead instead, it must be of equal value. Alchemy furnaces were rare and priceless, and this jade bead being comparable was extraordinary. He immediately said, "Quickly thank the Immortal Master!"
"Thank you, Senior!" Li Ximing replied earnestly.
Yuan Tuan nodded before extending her delicate hand, and released a faint white light that enveloped them, isolating them from the outside. She then asked seriously, "Are you aware of the chaos caused by the devil plague?"
Li Yuanjiao immediately became alert, and Li Yuanping, Li Xicheng, along with the others also pricked up their ears in attention. Li Yuanjiao replied, "Our family is located in northern Yue and has heard some news… It is said that Jiang Yan committed all kinds of evil, spreading the devil Dao lineage everywhere. These teachings have even spread among rogue cultivators and commoners, causing widespread chaos, especially in the south, which suffered greatly..."
"Correct." Yuan Tuan nodded and continued in a low voice, "Although Jiang Yan opposed our sect, he practiced the shamanic dao, not the devil dao as rumored. Moreover, he has been missing for many years… The devil plague must have another cause."
Li Yuanjiao frowned slightly and replied, "Senior, you mean to say that… the devil plague in Yue State is caused by someone who deliberately spread the devil Dao lineage…? Is anyone in the sect going to suppress and resolve it?"
Yuan Tuan's expression was difficult to read as she said softly, "No, but there are concerns among the peaks. We fear that if the devil plague is left unchecked, it will eventually lead to a tragedy like that of Pingming Ford."
The great battle between the immortals and devils took place at Pingming Ford, causing heaven and earth to collapse, mountains and rivers to submerge, and the divine continent to sink. This led to the immortal cultivators abandoning the north, the invasion of the Jie people, and the widespread influence of Buddhism, resulting in the current situation.
Li Yuanjiao nodded silently, understanding the gravity of the situation. Yuan Tuan then advised, "In recent years, we have repeatedly found traces of devil cultivators in the Mushroom Forest Plain, and we have even lost two Qi Cultivation Realm disciples. It seems the situation is worsening and moving north… Please keep an eye on this."
"Thank you for the reminder, Senior!"
Seeing Li Yuanjiao's respectful response and knowing he took this matter to heart, Yuan Tuan's delicate fingers emitted a trace of azure light. As soon as it touched the ground, it transformed into two white deer, blinking their eyes and standing still.
Yuan Tuan then said softly, "Good disciple, follow me back to the peak!"
Li Xizhi hurriedly bade farewell to his parents and brothers, then mounted the white deer and soared into the clouds.
Yuan Tuan gracefully mounted on the back of the deer as well and said softly, "If you wish to send a letter to the sect, send it to the Yuan Family. The favor of the predecessors will eventually fade, so work hard on your cultivation."
Her voice lingered in the air as the two white deer stepped on the clouds and disappeared without a trace. The remaining people looked up, and Li Yuanping finally spoke, "Azure Crest Manifestation truly has the demeanor of an immortal… I wonder which lineage it belongs to!"
The two exchanged glances, both pleased with the smooth proceedings and the gifts they had received. Li Xijun leaned over to Li Ximing curiously and said, "Brother! Let us see your fine dharma artifact!"
Li Ximing nodded eagerly, having been excited for a while but trying to maintain the family's dignity without showing joy in front of Yuan Tuan. His eyes sparkled as he activated his mana and the jade bead glowed slightly, then emitted a stream of azure light that drifted to the ground.
The azure light transformed into a white deer, about the size of a cat, looking very lively and blinking at the people. Li Xijun laughed, flipped onto the deer's back, and attempted to ride it.
The spirit deer, however, would not comply, darting left and right actively and trying to hide behind Li Ximing. Li Xijun laughed, grabbing its antlers and playfully wrestling with the spirit deer while Li Ximing held the bead and grinned.
"First stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm…" Li Yuanjiao muttered as he scanned the spirit deer with his spiritual sense, still dressed completely in black.
Li Yuanping nodded and replied, "It should be related to the cultivation level of the bead holder."
"Ming'er!" Li Yuanping called out, and Li Ximing hurriedly brought the dharma bead over, reluctantly handing it to Li Yuanjiao.
Li Yuanjiao took the dharma artifact, Azure Manifestation, and channeled his mana into it. After a few moments, he remarked, "It has some spirituality… it has already recognized its master."
He then handed the jade bead back to Li Ximing. Li Ximing, whose eyes had been glued to the bead, was overjoyed at this and tied it back onto his wrist.
After sending off the children among the generation of Xi and Yue, several clan guards entered the hall for the night watch. The two men sat down at a small table, and Li Yuanping said in a low voice, "The devil plague is approaching. I reviewed the clan's situation recently and wanted to discuss it with you, Big Brother."
"All right," Li Yuanjiao replied.
Li Yuanping began, "There are currently six Qi Cultivators in the clan. Big Brother is at the sixth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, Big Sister at the fifth heavenly layer, Uncle Donghe is currently away from home, Father is at the third heavenly layer, Sister-In-Law Guiluan and my mother are at the first heavenly layer."
"Besides the main lineage, there's also a Qi Cultivator in the branch lineage named Li Wen, who has just broken through. He's from the Jade Court Guards, specializing in protective duties." He paused, then called out to the clan guard, "Summon the battalion commander."
The person acknowledged his command and retreated while Li Yuanping continued, "External cultivators Tian Youdao, Tian Zhongqing, and Xu Gongming are all at the first heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, and guest cultivator An Zheyan is at the seventh heavenly layer. As for Unrefined Qi Cultivators similar to Li Qiuyang, there are seven to eight of them, mainly from Mount Yue. Facing a Qi Cultivation Realm devil cultivator would be a death sentence for them..."
After hearing this, Li Yuanjiao said in a deep voice, "Excluding our uncle and father who are not at home, there are six early-stage Qi Cultivators, two mid-stage, and one late-stage."
"Correct," Li Yuanping confirmed with a nod.
Just then, a robust, tall man with a rough face and strong build entered, kneeling powerfully with an aura that could push down golden mountains and jade pillars.
"Court Guard Li Wen greets Family Head and Clan Uncle!"
