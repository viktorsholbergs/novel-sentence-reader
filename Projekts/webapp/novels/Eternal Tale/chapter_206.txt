Ten years later, a stone table was built in front of the pavilion on the mountain peak.
Chen Xun was enjoying health tea, while Zheng Yi sipped his spiritual tea alone. The big black ox, sitting far away, was reading a book, unable to understand their conversation.
"Chen Xun, are you planning to cross the Tian Duan Plains?"
"Yes, I want to take a look. If there's no path, we'll come back."
"Have you prepared enough spirit stones and spiritual energy-replenishing pills? That place is a desolate land without any spiritual energy." Zheng Yi furrowed his brows, stroking his white beard. "There was once a Nascent Soul cultivator who crossed it. It took him 500 years to go back and forth, and he never saw the end."
"Zheng Yi, if there's no path, how do you explain the legends of the superpower on the other side?"
Chen Xun raised an eyebrow, knowing that the disciples of the Top Ten Sects were aware of much. Now, they addressed each other as friends instead of "Daoist."
"Let me think for a moment." Zheng Yi fell into deep thought, recalling ancient records from the sect. "The Tian Duan Plains wasn’t always like this. It wasn’t a wasteland. Our ancestors found traces of a large teleportation array."
"Oh?"
"The great plain likely underwent a tremendous change, and something is eroding the spiritual energy there. It could be dangerous."
"I’ve studied it too, and something is indeed eroding the spiritual energy!" Chen Xun became a bit excited. The Top Ten Sects' knowledge was vast. "So, there must be a path, right?"
"There must be," Zheng Yi said firmly after some thought. "But given the current speed of flying boats and a cultivator’s lifespan, it’s a meaningless journey."
"So now the only exploration left is in the North, and war has begun." Chen Xun spoke meaningfully. "But the result seems somewhat unexpected."
"Alas, my Danding Sect didn’t agree to it, but even Nascent Soul cultivators have no choice in the face of overwhelming trends." Zheng Yi’s expression darkened. Most of the Nascent Soul cultivators left behind opposed the war. "If we don’t fight now for future generations, the only option left is to die meaninglessly."
The Nascent Soul cultivators left behind were the last resort, to protect the younger generations if the plan failed.
Chen Xun remained silent. The situation was too complex to explain in a few words.
Zheng Yi gazed into the distance, reminiscing. "Still, there are some regrets."
"Of course."
"I don’t regret the failure of the plan, but I feel sorry for those young cultivators who died far away from home."
"Haha, I didn’t expect you to have such a heart."
"When you’re old, you no longer have the same drive to fight the heavens or people. Focusing on alchemy and nurturing the younger generation becomes more important."
"Zheng Yi, you’re growing on me. I'll toast you with tea instead of wine."
"Haha, Chen Xun, you truly are unconventional." Zheng Yi’s beard trembled as he laughed, raising his cup in return. His eyes showed some doubt. "What kind of tea is this?"
"Health tea. It’s a recipe from my master, meant to prolong life and preserve youth."
"Hahaha..."
Both men burst into laughter on the mountain peak.
"Moo?" The big black ox looked over in confusion before shuffling further away, gulping down its health tea.
At the stone table, Zheng Yi shifted the conversation. "When do you plan to depart? I’ll see you off. The Northern exploration may have failed, but the Western one might succeed!"
"Hmm... I might visit some other sects first, to study Nascent Soul techniques."
"Are you planning to create your own cultivation technique?"
"I’ve thought about it. Otherwise, I’ll always feel some regret."
"Chen Xun, wait a moment!"
A flash of brilliance appeared in Zheng Yi’s eyes as he retrieved a jade slip from his storage ring, infusing it with spiritual energy.
"What is this?"
"Chen Xun, with this, you’ll encounter fewer obstacles when visiting other Immortal Sects. I still have some influence that can help you."
"No need, that wasn’t my intention."
"Chen Xun, you’re from this realm of cultivation, right?"
"Of course, genuine and true!"
"Then that’s settled. After you cross the Tian Duan Plains, your name will spread far and wide."
Zheng Yi snorted and shouted loudly, "Your cultivation technique will come from this realm, and who would dare to look down on us?"
"Of course, if you end up defeated by everyone, then there’s no need to mention this realm."
After finishing, Zheng Yi nodded, stroking his white beard. "If it weren’t for this, I wouldn’t be lending you my influence."
Chen Xun was momentarily stunned, as was the big black ox overhearing from afar.
"Zheng Yi, you really believe I can cross the Tian Duan Plains?"
"Ridiculous! I’ve cultivated for over a thousand years, and you two are the first to suppress me. If you can’t make it, no one can."
"We accept this jade slip," Chen Xun said solemnly.
"Good. I’m off to refine some pills. I’ve just had a sudden insight. Let me know when you’re leaving."
"Alright." Chen Xun nodded.
Zheng Yi, in his white robes, waved his sleeve and gracefully departed, disappearing into the mountain mist with an air of immortal grace.
Chen Xun gazed at the distant mountains, clutching the jade slip with a smile.
Later, Chen Xun continued to study cultivation techniques while refining Five Element Pills.
When he reached the bottleneck in his cultivation, he discovered that the Five Element Pills greatly eased the pain and difficulty of advancing.
The Water Spirit Technique also perfectly complemented the Essence of All Things, allowing it to cultivate regular spiritual herbs or, with the Water Spirit Technique, to grow Five Elemental spiritual herbs. After modifying the pill recipes, they could be used effectively.
In his discussions with Zheng Yi, they shared much experience, which inspired Chen Xun’s improvements to the recipes.
The big black ox, on the other hand, struggled with understanding the various array diagrams, finding them too vast and profound.
Days were busy, fulfilling, and peaceful, filled with warmth. Another ten years passed.
Chen Xun and the big black ox finally left the mountain, with Zheng Yi personally seeing them off.
Only a few people in the Danding Sect knew that a man and a black ox had once been guests.
With Zheng Yi’s jade slip, they smoothly visited other Immortal Sects as guests, avoiding any further conflicts and living a quiet, low-profile life.
Chen Xun studied more and more Nascent Soul techniques, most of which were based on the Five Element Spiritual Roots.
He began using his body as a furnace, channeling the power of the Five Elements to break through, enduring the pain of his meridians being torn apart daily.
Sometimes his vital energy became chaotic, and the power of the Five Elements raged inside him, often causing blood to drip from the corners of his mouth.
The big black ox could only pace around anxiously, unable to help with the cultivation techniques.
