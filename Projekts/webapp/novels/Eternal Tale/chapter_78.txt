"Moo, moo~~" This time, it was the big black ox's turn to be frustrated, and its nose kept making "huff, huff" sounds.
"Alright, you win, you win."
"Moo?"
"Really, come up quickly."
Chen Xun slowly came ashore, and his spiritual energy continuously evaporated the mountain stream water on his body, emitting bursts of white mist, making his body instantly clean.
The big black ox shook its head vigorously; it didn't like using spiritual energy to dry itself, so it just let itself air dry while casually chewing on some grass.
"Old Ox, this 'Basic Five Elements Escape Technique' is incredible."
Chen Xun sat on the bank, took a deep breath, and said, "It's completely beyond our expectations and imaginations."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded with deep emotion.
Originally, the magical spell was not about flying and escaping. It was just a small spell for a foundation-building cultivator, using the principles of the Five Elements to transform into a small magical spell that couldn't do anything and could only confuse the enemy before escaping.
Even their true strength was not used just now.
Their spiritual energy incarnation was extremely realistic; although it couldn't move, it could differentiate into hundreds of them until the spiritual energy was exhausted, making it difficult to distinguish between true and false.
However, if you casually touched the incarnation, it would just turn into a wisp of spiritual energy and dissipate. Coupled with the 'Five Elements Escape Technique', they could easily shuttle through the incarnations and escape. It was the best way to run away.
Even the old ox's magical shield received enhancements in magical power and defense. Chen Xun had used full force before, and the shield didn't budge; at most, it would only push the old ox back a few steps.
"Old Ox, we must not underestimate these foundation-building spells."
"Moo?"
"Can you create a technique and benefit countless cultivators in the immortal cultivation world? If you charged copyright fees, others would have become rich long ago."
"Moo, moo!" The big black ox was surprised. It seemed like that was the case. It didn't understand the term copyright, but it understood that they couldn't create even simple spells like small fireballs, not to mention teach them to so many people.
"So, let's study various small spells more. These are the crystallizations of countless predecessors' wisdom. That is the real, long-lasting inheritance."
Chen Xun said solemnly. They didn't have such good conditions and luck to compete for those excellent techniques and spells. "These small spells are easy to obtain and easy to cultivate, and there must be commonalities among them."
In fact, when they went out for a stroll every day, they also visited many cliffs and the bottom of cliffs and even searched for so-called opportunities in various uninhabited caves.
But there was nothing, just picking up a few good-looking stones... It wasn't in vain, and the key was that Chen Xun and the big black ox were still very happy. They shouted that they had earned a lot.
As for those so-called advanced techniques, good cultivation methods, and spells, all of them were the inheritance of others, passed down only to disciples, not in the contribution hall of the sect.
Only some relics left by foundation-building cultivators and Nascent Soul cultivators who had no successors were placed in the contribution hall for foundation-building cultivators to exchange, just to pass on their legacies and not let their passing be meaningless.
If you just wanted to rely on yourself, you could only make great contributions to the Five Elements Sect. The sect would then give additional spells; after all, this wasn't a charitable organization.
What they exchanged for the most were some books, small spells, and various low-grade materials. As for top-tier cultivation methods and spells, they didn't even have the idea.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were just ordinary members among the countless foundation-building cultivators in the immortal cultivation world. Great opportunities and benefits couldn't be smashed into their heads.
"Moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, looking surprised. "Moo, moo?"
"Integration and mastery, Old Ox; with just this bit of talent, shouldn't we work hard?"
Chen Xun smiled slightly beside the big black ox and said, "Our defense even withstood the last meridian disorder. In the future, let's increase our efforts, and we can try the operational routes of spells and techniques."
"Moo!!" The big black ox exclaimed excitedly. Chen Xun was absolutely right. They were no longer novices in the cultivation world.
Creating techniques and spells from scratch required experimenting with countless operational routes. If done incorrectly, it could lead to demonic possession or even ascension to immortality, causing the entire sect to suffer.
It also wanted to try stacking numerous formations. Currently, they often clashed, causing backlashes, but fortunately, it had the magical shield, which saved it from countless injuries.
It was currently struggling to set up two small formations together. Every day, it brainstormed tirelessly with no shortcuts available, all while accumulating experience bit by bit.
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox urgently nudged Chen Xun.
It took out the "Complete Guide to Basic Formations" from its storage bag, along with several formation books brought by Ji Senior Brother from outside. These items were treasured by the big black ox and stored in the large grass hat Chen Xun made for it.
The big black ox's eyes widened, pointing at the books with its hoof while mooing loudly. It had just started in this field.
"Don't worry, Old Ox, you are the most genius formation master I have ever seen! You will definitely succeed."
Chen Xun naturally understood its meaning, and his tone and gaze were confident without any perfunctoriness. "I'll focus on techniques and spells, and you focus on formations. Although they are not strong, at least we can learn something, right?"
"Moo!" The big black ox stared with big eyes and nodded heavily. Chen Xun was truly smart; there was no one smarter in the world!
"But this is not something that can be achieved by just talking. It requires practicing countless small spells and spending a lot of time summarizing. Where do cultivators get so much lifespan?"
"However..."
Chen Xun's expression became calm, not arrogant or impatient. He paused here, slowly looking at the big black ox, which also looked back at him.
"The thing we are least lacking is time."
"Moo~"
They looked at each other affectionately, their mouths gradually twisting into a smile. Eventually, they started competing to see who could twist their mouths the most.
In the following years, they went to the contribution hall every year to exchange for small spells, such as "Morning Wind Technique," "Ice Valley Technique," "Five Leaf Technique," and many more.
The big black ox constantly changed small formation materials because of excessive wear and tear. Chen Xun also started refining tools; exchanging materials was always a bit cheaper than exchanging finished products.
Every year, they used up all their contributions. In the end, the elders of the contribution hall couldn't bear it anymore and even gave Chen Xun a few small spell books. They really didn't want to see this junior waste his contribution points.
Unexpectedly, when Chen Xun took them, he was overjoyed and expressed his gratitude. He vowed to come back next year, and the big black ox also followed suit, constantly bowing to express thanks. There were indeed many good people in the sect.
All the elders in the contribution hall were dumbfounded.
Chen Xun and the big black ox fell into busy times again. They arranged their days full, especially Chen Xun, who increasingly felt that these small spells were powerful and full of ingenious ideas.
The most important thing was that with the Five Elements Spirit Roots, there was a great advantageâ€”any type of spell could be cultivated without much taboo.
Apart from the fact that the power and consumption of spells were 'slightly worse' than others, there was no difference.
The big black ox was also practicing formations, with constant surprise mooing every day. Once it had a goal, life became more meaningful.
