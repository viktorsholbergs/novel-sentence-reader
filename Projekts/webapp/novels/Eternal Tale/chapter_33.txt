There is a hidden place called the Southern Dipper Mountain in the Qian Nation, which opens once every twenty years. It was sealed by several hundred great cultivators from the Qian Nation over ten thousand years ago, all for the sake of ensuring the future of cultivation in the Qian Nation.
There are countless spiritual herbs inside, with the most precious being those used for Foundation Establishment Pills. However, these herbs have already been divided among and guarded by major sects, and the spots are limited.
Furthermore, there are strict restrictions on the cultivation level to enter this secret realm; only Qi Refining stage cultivators can enter. The competition every twenty years is incredibly fierce, with only one out of ten making it.
Except for the Ten Great Sects, no other sects possess the method to cultivate these Foundation Establishment Pill herbs. This is the fundamental difference between the immortal sects. Trying to achieve Foundation Establishment without the aid of pills is not only a waste of time but it is also prone to going astray. After all, the lifespan of a Qi Refining practitioner was only a hundred years, and it takes a considerable amount of time to cultivate to the tenth level. Every extra year taken to achieve a breakthrough is a year closer to doom.
Since the Foundation Establishment herbs outside the Qian Nation have long been collected to the point of extension, and the fact that Qi Refining practitioners were too many in the recent years, the demand far outweighed the supply.
"I see now," Chen Xun understood. They wanted him and the others to act as pawns, or even cannon fodder.
"Of course, if you manage to collect three main herbs, the sect's seniors will naturally refine a batch of Foundation Establishment Pills, and those who participated in the collection will receive a share," Yin Jun added, changing the topic. "At the Five Elements Sect, we've never forced our disciples to participate, so you don't have to worry."
Chen Xun chuckled in response to Yin Jun's words but didn't say anything. However, in his heart, he knew why they didn’t have to force anyone. Those with poor aptitude would flock to participate anyway.
"After joining the Five Elements Sect, you can choose to be a disciple of the sect yourself, as long as you meet the contribution requirements every year," Yin Jun continued: "For example, I am an outer disciple. With contributions, I can exchange for techniques, spells, and many more. Every year, there is also a sect-wide competition. If you catch the eye of any elder and are accepted as their disciple, you can soar to the sky and become an inner disciple."
"What if I don't meet the contribution requirements?" Chen Xun asked.
"Make up for it the following year. If you fail to meet the requirements for three consecutive years, you will be expelled from the sect," Yin Jun explained, and his eyes showed fear when he mentioned expulsion. "This only applies to outer disciples, not inner disciples. And definitely not those in the Foundation Establishment stage.”
"Thank you for clarifying," Chen Xun said gratefully.
"However, about this ox of yours," Yin Jun glanced at the big black ox, his brow furrowing slightly. "The sect only accepts spiritual beasts."
"That's even better," Chen Xun patted the big black ox.
"Moo!"
The big black ox walked forward, emanating a burst of spiritual power. Yin Jun was shocked; The beast was at the second level of Qi Refining. He hadn’t noticed this before.
"Then there's no problem," Yin Jun stepped back and said, relieved.
Spiritual beasts are a significant combat force for cultivators. The Immortal Beast Sect, one of the Ten Great Sects, specializes in spiritual beasts and has powerful disciples among low-level cultivators.
"All right, I, Chen Xun, am willing to join the Five Elements Sect," Chen Xun said solemnly, bowing to Yin Jun.
"Please accept this disciple token," Yin Jun's eyes revealed joy as he handed Chen Xun a green token, smaller than the one from before. Chen Xun felt a surge of excitement inside him.
"On the day of the sect's closed-door cultivation, my senior will activate the token, and you will know where to meet then," Yin Jun explained.
"Okay, then I won't disturb you any longer," Chen Xun smiled and left with the big black ox.
Yin Jun nodded and looked back at the Purple Cloud Sect's trial site. He also had a token similar to the one held by the three women.
On the street, the big black ox appeared excited, occasionally nudging Chen Xun.
"Old ox, we're leaving this place," Chen Xun said with a smile.
He felt like he was a bit hasty in his decision. Perhaps he had gained a lot, but he also lost a lot, like grains of sand slipping through his fingers. However, joining the Five Elements Sect had long been part of Chen Xun's plan. He had inquired about the sect's strength in the valley before, and it was inferior to the Ten Great Sects but still more than adequate for his purposes.
The disciples of the Five Elements Sect often lingered around the Purple Cloud Sect's platform every year. While Chen Xun didn't know the exact reason, as long as they attracted attention, it served his purpose.
By demonstrating extraordinary strength in the first trial of the Purple Cloud Sect and then appearing to falter in the second trial, disciples from the Five Elements Sect would undoubtedly seek them out. They had brought all their assets with them this time.
_Ding ding._
A crisp sound rang out as the big black ox shifted its body a few times, looking at Chen Xun.
Chen Xun halted his steps, walked to the side of the big black ox, and gazed at their pots, pans, and bowls, all now yellowed and rusty.
"When the time comes, we'll polish them nicely. These are treasures," Chen Xun said.
"Moo, moo!" The big black ox lowered in agreement.
Chen Xun and the big black ox strolled through the Nine Stars Valley, their steps not as hurried as before. Gradually, they walked out of the valley and then suddenly accelerated their pace.
On the slope of a large peak, a solitary grave mound stood. Chen Xun and the big black ox arrived near Sun Kaiyue's grave, tidied up the weeds, and lit some incense.
"Old Sun, we're leaving. We will be going to a distant place and don't know when we'll be back," Chen Xun spoke softly, one hand still plucking weeds. "We've never been to such a faraway place before."
"Moo~" The big black ox muttered something on the side, expressing its thoughts.
The mountain breeze blew by the two figures who had already left, and a faint sigh wafted away with the mountain breeze.
After another half day, Chen Xun arrived at Ning Si's grave, next to which was the tombstone of Ning Si's wife.
"Master, Madam."
Chen Xun's voice trembled slightly as he bowed deeply, and the images of their smiling faces seemed like they had been with him just yesterday.
_"Although you weren't the most talented of my students, Master believes you will undoubtedly become the most skilled of them all."_
_"This child is indeed excellent, with good character and an excellent temperament."_
The two of them seemed to be sitting in front of their graves, still smiling, and looking at Chen Xun with satisfaction.
"We're leaving. We've come to bid farewell to Master and Madam," Chen Xun said solemnly, bowing deeply, and the big black ox followed suit, moving carefully.
Chen Xun patted the big black ox and turned to leave. Suddenly, he staggered forward as if someone had pushed him from behind. His pupils contracted sharply, and his eyes trembled.
"Moo?" The big black ox said.
"It’s nothing. Let’s go." Chen Xun didn’t look back anymore and said with a smile, leading the black ox away.
At this moment, a gentle breeze blew, and countless pieces of fluff suddenly floated into the sky, drifting without hesitation; similarly, two figures walked further and further away, unwavering.
...
A full moon hung high in the sky, appearing closer than usual. The moonlight of early winter, clear and cold, cast icy silver light on the land.
Many cultivators had already started to leave the Nine Stars Valley since tomorrow will be the final day of the meet. Many people’s hopes were dashed already.
In the distance, on a grassy field, several angry roars and pitiful screams echoed. The grass was stained with blood, and seven or eight figures stood scattered around, their lips curled with cold smiles.
"This is what provoking the Liao clan gets you!" The middle-aged man who had sold Chen Xun the seeds of the spirit herb stomped on a dead cultivator's head with a sinister look in his eyes. He had flying swords circling around him.
"Hmph, that idiot is here again," a round-faced man laughed grimly. The grudge from that one punch he had taken from Chen Xun still lingered. "I never expected him to show up again."
The Liao clan did business in the Nine Stars Valley all year round, and while they didn't have a Foundation Establishment cultivator overseeing them, they were not to be trifled with by ordinary cultivators.
"Hmph, he's been hiding for so long. I won’t let him escape this time," the middle-aged man said coldly, and the flying swords buzzed around with sharpness.
Suddenly, a palpitation surged through the Liao clan members. They looked toward the high ground in the grassland, their eyes filled with horror.
Under the moonlight, a figure in a hooded robe and a black ox stood on the elevated ground. The figure’s robe fluttered in the wind. He had three axes around his waist, and the big black ox's horns gleamed coldly, bathed in silver light.
"Long time no see—Liao clan."
The hooded figure tilted his head slightly, a faint, icy smile on his lips as he looked down at the crowd. "I heard you've been looking for me."
