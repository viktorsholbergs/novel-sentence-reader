Chen Xun turned around and looked at the three of them, his gaze momentarily pausing.
"Ancestor..."
The three of them respectfully cupped their hands, their palms sweaty. The brief look in the Ancestor's eyes made them feel an inexplicable unease.
"Mm." Chen Xun smiled gently. "From now on, I will personally instruct you, but there’s no need to call me 'Master.'"
"Yes, Ancestor," they responded, not daring to ask why. Whatever the Ancestor said, they would follow without question.
"Moo~" The big black ox also turned to look at the three, its eyes showing a peculiar expression as its tail swayed gently.
"From now on, forget everything you know about the cultivation world," Chen Xun said, his gaze narrowing as he looked into the distance. "Do exactly as we tell you, and don't worry too much about your current cultivation levels."
"Moo!" The big black ox snorted.
"Understood," the three replied, never raising their heads, their actions becoming increasingly respectful. The words of a Nascent Soul Ancestor were absolute, beyond question.
"The first step is to take a look at this booklet," Chen Xun said with a light cough, producing three small booklets. "These contain some of my experiences during the Qi Refinement stage. Study them well."
"Thank you, Ancestor!" The three of them were instantly filled with excitement, accepting the booklets with both hands.
To receive insights and experiences from a Nascent Soul Ancestor was something they could never have imagined, akin to receiving divine teachings.
"Good, take your time. The flying boat will be traveling for a few more months," Chen Xun said with a slight nod. "This will be crucial for your future path."
The three of them respectfully cupped their hands and quickly sat down to immerse themselves in the booklets, not daring to whisper to one another.
However, as they opened the first page with excitement, their expressions suddenly changed.
Instead of insights on cultivation, the booklet was filled with various questions and answers...
"Question: You encounter a demonic cultivator at the fifth level of Qi Refinement who is robbing and harming mortals, while you are at the sixth level of Qi Refinement. What should you do?"
"Answer 1: Uphold justice and protect the weak. We must act righteously and show our strength."
"Answer 2: The difference in strength isn't significant, and you don't know their hidden abilities. It's best to quietly pass by and avoid danger."
"Answer 3: Hide and ambush! Destroy the enemy without a trace, then return to the sect for a reward, boasting of your success."
"Answer 4:..."
...
A cold sweat appeared on their foreheads as they realized the booklet even included detailed explanations for each answer. They felt as if they had died countless times, their eyes trembling with shock.
The big black ox grinned as it watched their reactions. Even it had died several times when facing the questions that its big brother had once posed.
Chen Xun's lips curled up in a smile. These were all valuable life lessons, crucial for disciples just beginning their journey on the path of cultivation.
This cultivation world was far from the idyllic place they might have imagined.
**Buzz!**
The flying boat continued to move through the thick clouds, while the three young cultivators were deeply absorbed in their booklets.
The contents completely overturned their understanding. The cultivation world was far more dangerous than they had ever imagined...
Shi Wujun was the most excited. The teachings from the elders in the sect had always been about how to cultivate, often dull and monotonous—nothing like the rich and colorful lessons from the Ancestor!
Liu Han's palms were already so sweaty she could wring them out. She had died so many times in the scenarios, realizing that her previous thoughts had all been wrong.
Ji Zhao, on the other hand, was thoroughly engrossed, even managing to answer a few questions correctly.
He had never been exposed to the cultivation world before and now realized how terrifying it could be. He was determined to remember every word the Ancestor had written.
"Old Ox, let's start cultivating as well. I still need to refine some of my ideas," Chen Xun said.
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox nodded vigorously, taking out a formation manual from its storage ring to continue its studies.
They both sat down cross-legged at the bow of the boat. Those booklets would keep the three youngsters occupied for quite some time.
The flying boat continued its journey through the sky, heading eastward toward the Qian Kingdom.
Three months later, at Nine Palaces Mountain.
The flying boat slowly descended in front of Fengdu, where Jiang Xuechen was already waiting on the ground.
She looked up at the sky, her expression showing a hint of surprise, and then bowed respectfully and said, "Senior."
Liu Han, Shi Wujun, and Ji Zhao felt a bit shy as they glanced around, then quietly lowered their heads, feeling overwhelmed by the unfamiliar surroundings.
Although the spiritual energy here was richer than that of the Five Elements Sect, it didn’t give them a sense of security. The two Ancestors also seemed distant.
"Xuechen." Chen Xun chuckled, storing the flying boat in his storage ring. "These three are descendants of old friends. I’ve brought them here to teach them for a while."
"Greetings, Senior," the three of them said, looking at Jiang Xuechen, their hearts pounding.
Shi Wujun and Ji Zhao blushed, not daring to look directly at Jiang Xuechen. That brief glimpse earlier had captured their gaze entirely.
Liu Han, however, kept her big eyes open, stealing a couple of glances at Jiang Xuechen. She was so beautiful.
"So, they are your descendants," Jiang Xuechen said with a kind smile, taking out three magical artifacts from her storage ring. "Our meeting is sudden, so take these as gifts."
The three of them took a half-step back, quickly looking toward Chen Xun, with Ji Zhao sneaking a glance at the big black ox, who seemed quite friendly toward him.
"Go ahead and accept them. This is Jiang Xuechen, the master of the Moon Tower," Chen Xun introduced, patting the big black ox. "You’re now standing on Nine Palaces Mountain, within the territory of the Moon Tower."
"Yes, Ancestor. Thank you, Senior Jiang," the three of them replied, lowering their heads as they accepted the gifts. The low-grade Xuan-class artifacts felt heavy in their hands.
Yet they were also a bit puzzled. They had never heard of the Moon Tower.
Seeing their reactions, Chen Xun couldn’t help but feel a twinge in his heart. As expected of a Master, so generous, even to Qi Refinement disciples.
The big black ox's eyes widened, thinking back to how poor they had been during their own Qi Refinement days—it couldn’t compare.
"As expected of the descendants of your old friends, they truly are outstanding," Jiang Xuechen said with a smile, looking at the three of them. "If you need anything, feel free to come to Snow Listening Valley. They’re also welcome to come and go as they please."
"Thank you."
"Moo~"
"Thank you, Senior Jiang."
The four of them and the ox all expressed their thanks together on the cliff, making it feel like a strange, multi-generational gathering.
Jiang Xuechen bowed to Chen Xun before stepping into the air and disappearing. She was busy with other matters and couldn’t stay with the two seniors.
"Alright, stop staring; she’s already gone," Chen Xun said with a wave, giving each of the three a light tap on the back of the head.
"Moo moo~" The big black ox chuckled behind Chen Xun. This was just like how Chen Xun used to scold Little Hei back in the small village.
"Ancestor, hehe..." The three scratched their heads, and their faces flushed red. They had never seen such a beautiful female senior before.
"From now on, we’ll be living here. You’re here to cultivate, not to play around," Chen Xun reminded them.
"Yes, Ancestor!" The three of them snapped to attention, realizing they couldn’t afford to miss this great opportunity.
"Old Ox, let’s build some houses. You three, follow along."
"Moo!"
"Yes."
"What do you mean, 'yes'? Hurry up."
Chen Xun walked ahead with his hands behind his back, followed by the running ox and three youngsters. Soon, they were busy cutting down trees in the forest, the sound of crashing trees echoing through the mountains.
