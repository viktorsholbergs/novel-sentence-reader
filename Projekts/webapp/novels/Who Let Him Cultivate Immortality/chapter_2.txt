Chapter 2: The Single Spirit Root
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou had only one thought in their minds: they were doomed, having discussed cheating right in front of the examiner.
Senior Sister Yun Zhi, acted oblivious to their cheating plans, glancing at them briefly before moving on to organize the test. Her authority among the Dao Seeking Sect disciples was evident, commanding respect and obedience.
These disciples, revered and idolized outside, were the proud sons of heaven. Yet, they all heeded her commands without hesitation, a testament to Senior Sister Yun Zhi’s esteemed status.
“Your Spirit Root is the first hurdle on the path to immortality. Without the right Spirit Root, no amount of resources can aid in cultivation. The first test will assess your Spirit Root. Step forward in turn. Those who lack confidence in their Spirit Root may leave now.”
No one left.
Those who came for the Dao Seeking Sect’s test knew their Spirit Root well. Few, like Lu Yang, were there merely because of proximity.
The Dao Seeking Sect aimed to prevent those with insufficient Spirit Root, yet hoping to bluff their way through, from infiltrating their ranks.
Typically, a Spirit Root Stone, large and conspicuous, would be used for testing. Given the emptiness in front of the Dao Seeking Sect, they evidently had no intention of using it.
A Dao Seeking Sect disciple named Dai Bufan sat at the forefront. His cultivation technique was unique; a single circulation of spiritual energy through one’s body would reveal their Spirit Root, cultivation technique, and even the location of their life gate, making him extremely adept in combat, like a fish in water.
Dai Bufan, like an experienced doctor taking one’s pulse, could discern one’s Spirit Root with just two fingers on the wrist.
“Triple Spirit Root of metal, water, and fire? Passable, move on.”
“Double Spirit Root of water and fire, not bad.”
“Double Spirit Root of water and wood, once had your foundation damaged. It must have been a severe injury when you were twelve. Ordinarily, it would have left complications, but fate had other plans. You encountered a benevolent master who, with exquisite medical skills, healed you and restored your root foundation.”
The individual was slightly astonished, not expecting Dai Bufan’s accuracy, “When I was twelve, my mother passed away. My stepmother decided to take action, fearing my presence might threaten her son’s status. She plotted against me. I fell into a coma and woke up unharmed. My father told me a kind stranger had passed by and saved me but left without leaving their name.”
As the individual left, Dao Seeking Sect disciples came to congratulate Dai Bufan for his advanced skills, “You deduced the whole story just by taking the pulse, as if you witnessed it yourself! Brother Dai’s skills have truly progressed!”
Dai Bufan nonchalantly responded, “Oh, it’s nothing. That kind stranger was me. I was in a hurry and forgot to leave my name after saving him.”
“…”
Amidst the conversation, Dai Bufan gestured for the next person to step forward, “Eighteen years old, too old, you may leave.”
A cute little monk, guided by an elder monk, approached Dai Bufan and respectfully greeted him.
Dai Bufan cast a glance at the little monk and handed him back to the elder monk, “What’s a novice monk from the Hanging Temple doing here? Your body bears the imprint left by the Hanging Temple’s abbot. Off you go, back to your Hanging Temple.” (TL Note: The Hanging Temple is based off a real place in China. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Temple)
“Isn’t the Hanging Temple one of the five great immortal sects?” Lu Yang whispered to Meng Jingzhou.
Meng Jingzhou nodded, speaking seriously, “The Hanging Temple has the fewest disciples among the five great immortal sects. At times, it has only the abbot and one disciple. Even at its fullest, it never exceeds ten. This novice monk, not yet a cultivator, is already a disciple of the Hanging Temple, surely possessing profound Buddhist virtues.”
Watching the novice monk escorted away by his senior, Meng Jingzhou felt a sense of rivalry, “I thought I’d be peerless in the future cultivation world. It seems there are others worthy of being my rivals.”
Lu Yang couldn’t fathom where Meng Jingzhou’s confidence came from, “Aren’t you worried that Miss Yun Zhi might kick us out?”
“What’s there to worry about? Haven’t you read the novels? The big sects are always blind, falsely accusing and banishing talented youths. The youths take it as a disgrace, strive hard, encounter fortuitous adventures, and soar to the skies, becoming a presence the big sects look up to… oh wait, look down upon.”
After a moment of silence, Lu Yang reminded, “But Miss Yun Zhi doesn’t need to falsely accuse us…”
“Good point.”
Meng Jingzhou, too, started to panic.
“Your internal energy circulates endlessly on its own, and your attire doesn’t resemble that of a cultivation family. Could it be that you consumed the Azure Wood Immortal Fruit in your childhood? You may pass.”
“Interesting physique,” Dai Bufan remarked, his fingers on a brawny man with bronze skin, his eyes lighting up, “Ancient barbarian lineage, haven’t seen that in a long time.”
The man, tall and sturdy with a shiny bald head reflecting the sunlight, looked like he could be twenty-five or twenty-six. But since Dai Bufan didn’t question his age, he must be under sixteen.
All Lu Yang could say was, he developed well.
The crowd stirred slightly. The ancient barbarian lineage, known for its ability to uproot mountains and swallow the sun and moon, flourished to its zenith before vanishing into the annals of time.
The Central Continent had not seen the ancient barbarian lineage for ages. Everyone thought this ancient bloodline had disappeared, but now, it surprisingly appeared in the Dao Seeking Sect’s test.
Yawning, Dai Bufan had already inspected half of the candidates. Not even one Single Spirit Root? Had the other sects snatched them all away?
Meng Jingzhou confidently stepped forward. Dai Bufan had little expectation, but when his index and middle fingers touched Meng Jingzhou’s wrist, his eyes bulged, and he sprang up, “It’s actually a single…”
Hearing Dai Bufan, murmurs erupted below, a Single Spirit Root!
A Single Spirit Root signified smoother progression through the stages of cultivation, destined to become a grand cultivator of the immortal path. In the court, one could hold high positions; in the wild, one could rule a territory, even establish a kingdom!
Everyone’s gaze focused on Meng Jingzhou, their eyes eager. Befriending such an individual early on did not have any downsides and could only bring benefits!
Elders hurriedly instructed their juniors, once inside the Dao Seeking Sect, to establish a good relationship with Meng Jingzhou.
Meng family, Single Spirit Root, Dao Seeking Sect disciple – these three identities combined foretold a future influential figure in the Dao Seeking Sect, a cultivation powerhouse destined for history.
“Single Spirit Root,” Dai Bufan announced the full name of Meng Jingzhou’s Spirit Root, silencing the crowd.
Meng Jingzhou was furious. What was this ‘Single Spirit Root’? Was it implying a lifetime of being single?
“I have limited experience, don’t trap me in this!” Meng Jingzhou, veins bulging, angrily slapped the table, causing a loud commotion.
“Junior Brother Dai, don’t jest with others,” a voice as ethereal as an immortal came. Yun Zhi emerged from a mist, glaring at Dai Bufan, who sheepishly shrank back.
Meng Jingzhou calmed down a bit, reassured that Dai Bufan was just fooling around.
However, Yun Zhi addressed Meng Jingzhou, “But Junior Brother Dai wasn’t deceiving you. You indeed possess the Single Spirit Root, that’s the academic name. However, in the cultivation world, it’s more commonly known by its colloquial name, Pure Yang Spirit Root.”
Meng Jingzhou was speechless.
He finally understood why the clan elders and his parents never told him his Spirit Root.
What “You’ll find out in the five great immortal sects” – they were simply too embarrassed to tell him!
No wonder after his Spirit Root test, his parents asked whether he wanted a younger brother or sister.
Mutated Single Spirit Root, Pure Yang Spirit Root, the epitome of firmness and positivity, the bane of ghosts and demons.
Maintain the Pure Yang state, and cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds. Break the Pure Yang state, and cultivation will plummet. (TL Note: Pure Yang refers to his virginity. He won’t be able to have kids which is why his parents asked if he wanted a younger brother or sister)
