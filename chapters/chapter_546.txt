Qingdu Cave Dwelling.
The Sun Seeker Ring spun once in midair before it lightly drifted down again. As it settled, all the extraordinary visions within the cave dwelling disappeared. Li Xijun caught the ring and examined it closely. It looked no different from before, and its materials remained indistinct. It also felt surprisingly light in his hand.
Inspecting it with his spiritual sense, the Sun Seeker Ring seemed quite ordinary, almost as if it were just a simple flying shuttle, though its materials were unknown. If Li Xijun had not witnessed the speed at which Xu Xiao rode on it, he never would have guessed it was a treasured artifact.
Nearby, Li Qinghong checked the mirror, finding no anomalies either. Li Xijun murmured, "Aunt… this should not be a bad thing."
"Indeed…" Li Qinghong nodded. The two studied the artifact for a while but gained no further insights.
Li Xijun then added, "Aunt, the altar described in your thunder technique has been completed… It has not been used since you went abroad. Now that you are back, you could test out the Celestial Thunder."
Li Qinghong cultivated an ancient technique, with an immortal foundation capable of summoning thunder from the heavens. Yet, with heaven and earth undergoing such changes, she was not certain if the attempt would work. After nodding lightly, she put away the Sun Seeker Ring and returned the immortal mirror.
With everything finally in order, Li Xijun felt no regret about the lost opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, having secured so many other crucial items. After leaving, he flew for a while before landing in Lijing Town.
Kneeling figures lined the steps of the central hall, and a cursory glance revealed many familiar faces, mostly from the Liu and Xu families, all bowing their heads with sobs filling the air.
Seeing this, Li Xijun descended, and a Liu Family member immediately crawled over, tearfully recounting old ties and grievances. Li Xijun offered polite comfort before quickly moving along.
As he approached, the Jade Court Guards on both sides kneeled in respect. He stepped into the central hall, which was simply but elegantly arranged. At the highest seat sat a middle-aged man with a square face and broad forehead.
Li Xijun greeted, "Elder Brother."
This was Li Xicheng, the current head of the family, who had served as the leader for several years. His experience had granted him a more tempered demeanor. He greeted his approaching younger brother with a quiet voice, "It's been a while since I last saw you… The Liu and Xu families have been kneeling here for an entire night. What do you think, Eighth Brother?"
Li Xijun stepped back and, with a gesture, replied respectfully, "Elder Brother manages the family, and I would not presume to advise."
Li Xicheng smiled, straightening his posture.
"The Liu Family will not receive heavy punishment; a night of kneeling is enough. They have fallen far and have little left to penalize. Let them disperse. As for the Xu Family, I plan to split them into branches. Xu Xiao is dead, and his lineage will be removed from the records. The other Xu branches, having reported the devil cultivator, will receive rewards."
He continued, "Captain Chen was killed by Commander Chen Mufeng himself. We will report that he died from devil cultivation techniques. His family will receive protection, and Chen Mufeng will be demoted from a battalion commander to a court guard."
Li Xijun listened as his elder brother went on, "As for Elder Qiuyang, I sent him a reward, but he declined it and returned to farming… I can only pass it down to his son. Elder Qiuyang has contributed immensely, though none of his children have any spiritual orifice. He has received all the recognition we can offer, but with his dao path severed… there is little else we can give him."
Li Xijun nodded.
"Elder Brother handles these matters well; I need not say more. As for Chengliao, there are additional rewards coming from the mountain."
They spoke a while longer until Li Xijun cupped his fist, sensing weariness beneath his brother's composed demeanor. After dismissing the Jade Court Guards, he spoke gently, "Elder Brother, appoint more assistants if needed… Do not exhaust yourself. Your health is important, as is maintaining your cultivation."
Li Xicheng hesitated before nodding slowly, his gaze dropping.
"I personally promoted Chen Mufeng… I bear some responsibility for this outcome," he said softly with a regretful sigh.
Li Xijun was about to say something when he saw a servant from the Clan Affairs Courtyard approaching. The servant bowed deeply and said, "The old clan head has summoned the two of you."
"Uncle Yuanping?"
The two brothers exchanged a glance, realizing something was amiss, and their expressions turned grave. Li Xicheng then whispered, "I will go up the mountain right away."
Neither dared to delay. They hurried up the mountain, and indeed, a solemn air greeted them. Entering the courtyard, they saw people coming and going. As they stepped into the inner courtyard, they saw someone lying on a bed.
Li Yuanping's face was pale as he leaned against the edge of the bed. Li Qinghong sat beside him, while his wife, Madam Ren, who had only reached the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, sat nearby. She was in her forties, with a few wrinkles lining her face, and she was quietly sobbing.
The two kneeled in fear, and Li Yuanping scanned them briefly. Though his voice was weak, it remained gentle.
"Years ago, my brother and I kneeled before Ancestor Tongya's bed. His words still echo in my ears… In the blink of an eye, I cannot hold on any longer."
Li Xijun and Li Xicheng offered quiet words of comfort. Having studied under him for many years, Li Xicheng felt a deeper bond with him and could not help but tear up. Li Yuanping then asked, "Where is Li Ximing?"
Bracing himself, Li Xijun replied, "Brother Ming is currently in seclusion, breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."
Li Yuanping gazed into the distance, his lips pale as he whispered, "It's alright then…"
Madam Dou supported him, stricken with grief. She was Li Xuanxuan's primary wife and had managed the household for a period of time. Now, at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, she had reached her limit, with no path forward.
Madam Dou had borne two sons for Li Xuanxuan. One by one, both had died before her eyes. Decades ago, she had bid farewell to Li Yuanxiu, and now she was about to lose Li Yuanping as well. Her hair had turned white, and she was powerless.
Li Yuanping glanced around, many words left unsaid, and could only murmur quietly, "Cheng'er, from now on… you will have to rely on yourself."
Li Xicheng could no longer hold back his tears. He bowed deeply while kneeling, striking his head on the ground twice. Li Yuanping waved a hand, silencing him, then looked toward Li Xijun, "Xijun, I will have to trouble you to clean up Ming'er's mess… When the elders are gone, the family will depend on you."
Li Xijun lifted his head, locking eyes with Li Yuanping. He understood that Yuanping knew everything. His brows relaxed, and he replied softly, "Xijun has only done what the younger generation should do."
Li Yuanping let out a faint, hollow laugh, his voice weakening, "Elder Sister, I entrust the family affairs to you and Brother."
He gradually sank down, a faint, almost inaudible sigh escaping from his throat.
"Ancestor, it is not that I have failed you… the heavens simply did not grant me more time…"
In the stillness that followed, the light in his eyes dimmed. Beside his pillow lay two handwritten books, which Li Qinghong, wiping away her tears, picked up. One was titled Tales of the Desert, a compilation of notes left by Li Jingtian, and the other was A Chronicle of Thirty-Two Years of Household Management.
He had only ordinary cultivation, worked tirelessly his entire life, and left behind no secret manuals or rare techniques. The only books he wrote contained merely his lifetime observations. Li Qinghong carefully put them away and rose to her feet.
Those kneeling below remained silent. Li Qinghong surveyed them and spoke softly, "Arrange everything well… I will take him to the ancestral hall."
Li Xicheng nodded with a choked reply while Li Xijun stood frozen to the spot, staring at Li Yuanping's hand, as if recalling something. His hand slowly caressed the Hanlin sword without a word.
Li Qinghong then ascended on the wind and entered the ancestral hall, first reading the two books before storing them on top of a table.
The ancestral hall remained as quiet as ever. Rows upon rows of memorial tablets lined the walls, with incense smoke flowing between them. Li Qinghong stood silently for a moment, then spoke softly, "Grandfather… My brother and I have both reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, yet without you here, the family feels unsteady, and our hearts are empty."
Li Qinghong had heard every word Li Yuanping spoke on his deathbed. The sadness lingered in her heart. Usually reserved, she rarely spoke so much, but she muttered to the tablet of Li Tongya for a while before finally leaving in silence.
She did not have time to dwell on her grief. She bathed, changed clothes, and lit incense, praying continuously for three months to prepare to ascend the altar.
