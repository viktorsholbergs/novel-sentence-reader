"Fellow Daoists, set sail to conquer the Heavens!"
A vast voice echoed from afar, sweeping across the seas with unstoppable force, causing towering waves. "Meet the Daoists from the Four Immortal Mountains overseas, then journey together to the Heavenly River's edge to carve a path for the beings of our realm!"
The roaring wind howled like thunder, tearing across the sea.
"Kill!"
"Kill!""Kill!"
The Baili Clan’s army roared from the skies, shaking heaven and earth. A blood-red formation stretched from the ship, linking all the warships, bathing the heavens in crimson light.
Chen Xun had been shouting alongside the others for immersion, but the ship suddenly jolted as if struck.
"Moo!!" The big black ox stared at the translucent blood-red array connecting their small boat, eyes wide with shock. "What a grand display!"
Little Red clung to Chen Xun’s back, trembling at the sight of the array and quickly silencing its shouts.
"Set forth!"
"Set forth!"
Echoes thundered from all directions. The boundless azure Western Sea surged with crashing waves, slamming against warships with earth-shattering force.
Buzz!
Buzz!
The skies and sea filled with an endless fleet of warships, shrouded in stormy winds, all heading toward the Four Immortal Mountains overseas.
The entire sea realm trembled; even the beasts below shuddered. The heavens quaked, waves raged, and ancient horns echoed from the skies, accompanied by deafening war drums that shook the world.
"Yes!"
"Yes!""Yes!"
The cultivators aboard the warships roared, eyes brimming with murderous intent, battle spirit surging as their spiritual energy raged wildly.
The warships, like a torrential flood, unfurled their sails. Pulled by the leading War Realm ship, they sped into the deep seas, venturing into life and death.
Chen Xun carried Little Red on his back, standing resolutely alongside the big black ox, joining the cultivators in their march.
A year later, in the far depths of the Western Sea, where the sky met the horizon, blue landmasses resembling ancient glazed tiles rose like continents, stretching into infinite space.
The sea was stained red with blood. Countless sea beasts were slain before they could even emerge. This march had terrified all sea creatures into fleeing and left many evil cultivators’ lairs deserted.
Facing such an overwhelming force, none dared resist. Even reckless evil cultivators cherished their lives, unwilling to challenge the unstoppable tide.
The Western Sea’s creatures had no choice but to retreat, for those who blocked the way faced certain death.
Amidst ominous clouds, Chen Xun lounged on his small boat, leisurely reading a book.
The journey had long ceased to offer scenic beauty; the sky was pitch-black, and visibility was entirely obscured. Exploring with divine sense was unthinkable.
Fortunately, the Baili Clan’s War Realm ship provided escort, sparing them the cost of travel and ensuring an astonishingly swift pace.
Suddenly, a commotion broke out.
"Brace yourselves; we are entering the Four Immortal Mountains’ domain!"
"The sea surface is inclining upward—do not panic! This is the hanging sea; we have left the Western Sea!""Focus your minds and prepare to ascend!"
From above, the fleet of warships began rumbling. Their hulls tilted as protective barriers activated, casting dazzling rainbows of light.
The entire sea tilted upward. The ships clashed against massive waves, roaring cultivators surged forward, and towering waves rocked the soul.
Chen Xun, the big black ox, and Little Red clung to the stern, staring behind them in shock.
The sea tilted, revealing countless massive ships riding the waves. The crashing sounds were deafening, as if the sea itself boiled.
Above, the cultivators stood resolute, eyes sharper than ever. None stayed inside to cultivate; they all faced the wind at the forefront, robes billowing wildly.
Though they came with differing goals, at this moment, those goals seemed insignificant.
"Holy crap… so this is the cultivation world."
Chen Xun’s eyes widened as their ship ascended a forty-five-degree incline. At last, he glimpsed the distant seascape—an endless spray of waves filled the heavens.
"Moo~~" The big black ox exhaled heavily near Chen Xun, eyes wide with shock. The tilting sea was even more dramatic than the Thunder Sea they had seen before.
Little Red let out a series of low growls, its face twisted into a comically awkward expression. Feeling countless gazes on them, it nearly locked eyes with several people.
"Brother Xun, isn’t this... a bit too thrilling?" Little Red’s heart raced wildly. The grandeur of the scene overwhelmed it. "We won’t fall off, right?!"
Looking at the ever-distant sea level, it gulped nervously, unsure how high they’d risen.
"There’s a slight chance," Chen Xun replied solemnly. "Old Ox, activate the formation."
Terrified, Little Red shrank its head, only to suddenly realize—it was a mid-Nascent Soul spirit beast and could tread on air!
"Moo!" The big black ox glanced at Chen Xun and nodded lightly.
With a stomp of its hoof, green light surged around them, enveloping their small, shabby boat. A faint sound rang out as the boat firmly adhered to the hanging sea.
Seeing this, Little Red let out a sigh of relief. Falling would have been utterly embarrassing—and they might even crash into someone below.
Chen Xun turned to the crimson line at the bow, still feeling uneasy. Trusting himself seemed safer; no mishaps would occur.
After securing everything, they resumed admiring the surreal scene, lost in awe. Chen Xun even had the urge to shout but restrained himself, given the sheer number of cultivators present.
Boom!
Boom!
The colossal War Realm ships, like towering mountains, rumbled above. They served as focal points, extending endless crimson pillars to guide the warships through the heavenly passage.
The pillars, once faint and ethereal, grew increasingly solid. The warships accelerated, surging into the inverted sea.
One month later, at night.
Above the hanging sea, four majestic immortal mountains stood in the distance.
Even at night, their presence was impossible to ignore. Immortal light cascaded from them, vibrant and mist-shrouded, as if alive, stretching toward the heavens to overlook the inverted sea.
The mountains were widely spaced, visible only from afar.
Their forms resembled mighty dragons raising their heads, exuding unparalleled grandeur. Compared to these mountains, even Qian Nation’s Southern Dipper Mountain was insignificant.
The mountains radiated immense spiritual energy, with countless hidden spiritual veins, yet the atmosphere remained tranquil and timeless under the eternal sun and moon.
Beyond them loomed a hanging celestial curtain. An ancient formation sealed the heavens and earth, barring all life from advancing further—a display of absolute dominance.
Gazing upon these immortal mountains, even the soul seemed overwhelmed, as worldly schemes and ambitions faded into nothingness.
"Rise!"
That night, four ancient, resonant voices echoed from the immortal mountains, their tones imbued with a vast oppressive force, like colossal stars crashing down. The sea trembled.
Immortal light burst forth from the mountains, rippling with strange energy. The four mountains shook violently, emitting earth-shattering sounds.
Mists swirled upward, sweeping across the skies. The clouds above were shredded to pieces, leaving a breathtaking display.
Boom!
A sudden change occurred. Massive misty voids appeared at the centers of the four immortal mountains, from which enormous warships slowly emerged, brimming with volatile spiritual energy.
Onboard stood men and women clad in peculiar attire, vastly different from the Great Li Realm, yet their faces were strikingly youthful.
Their expressions were cold and resolute. They had prepared for this journey for years, carrying the legacy of the ancients and the will of their domain. For a thousand years, the ancient clans had never feared bloodshed.
"March for the beings of our domain!"
"March for the beings of our domain!"
Ancient, grand horn sounds echoed from the four mountains as fleets of warships, vast enough to blot out the sky, emerged. This journey, regardless of the progress made at the Heavenly River or the casualties endured, was undertaken without fear.
Cultivators, though mortal and destined to perish, could not allow hope to die, nor their domain to fall. Too many weak successors had yet to grow.
Their survival until now had been paid for with the blood of their predecessors. Even if some saw them as cannon fodder, pointless sacrifices, or unnecessary advances, this was the essence of their cultivation.
Someone had to stand for the domain. Always.
