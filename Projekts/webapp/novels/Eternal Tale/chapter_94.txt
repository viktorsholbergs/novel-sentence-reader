In the eyes of outsiders, Chen Xun and the big black ox seemed to be stuck at the early Foundation Building stage, as if they had reached the limit of their aptitude.
At the Huiquan Jian Spiritual Medicine Garden, within the cave residence.
The big black ox sat against the stone wall, looking at Chen Xun with an arrogant expression, as if they had returned to the cave in the small mountain village.
Chen Xun's eyes were deep. He was dressed in black, with black shoes like ink, standing alone on the ground. A gentle breeze passed by, causing the hem of his clothes to flutter softly.
He solemnly took out a heavy black bandit mask, and as sunlight slightly penetrated through, it seemed to be absorbed. He slowly put it on.
"Moo!" The big black ox widened its pupils. Chen Xun seemed to have transformed into a different person; his temperament changed dramatically!
A faintly cold smile appeared at the corner of Chen Xun's mouth. He turned his head to look at the big black ox with sharp and profoundly icy eyes, unintentionally giving off an extremely strong sense of oppression.
The big black ox kept exhaling, a cold sweat appeared on its oxhead, and its pupils trembled as it looked at Chen Xun. It kept making low mooing sounds.
Just to express: Big brother is awesome!
Chen Xun arrogantly raised his head and laughed loudly towards the sky. His eyes narrowed slightly, and he looked at the big black ox and asked, "Old Ox, does it feel right?!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox shouted excitedly. It was definitely right.
"With the complete set of bandit equipment, I am now fully equipped. From now on, it's time to kill; may the Buddha... bless!" Chen Xun's eyes revealed a trace of killing intent, and he looked at the big black ox and said, "Junior, feel free to probe me with your divine sense."
"Moo!" The big black ox nodded heavily, and its eyes condensed as it probed Chen Xun with its divine sense.
After an incense stick of time.
The big black ox was sweating profusely, and there was confusion in its eyes. "Moo? Moo moo?"
When it placed its divine sense on Chen Xun, it seemed as if it didn't exist at all. The God's-eye perspective was like it malfunctioned—not as good as using its eyes!
The thing that could cause a great war in the cultivation world, the Ten Thousand Years Thousand Silk Spirit Vine, was truly terrifying.
"Hahaha... Old Ox, just with your late Foundation Building cultivation, you also dare to probe this lord!" Chen Xun laughed loudly, his gaze slightly condensed as he looked at the big black ox. "Junior, die!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox shrank against the stone wall, shivering. This was too terrifying...
"Hahaha..."
A loud noise echoed in the cave residence. Chen Xun was directly sent flying into the stone wall, "suffered severe injuries," and laughed to the extreme.
This man and ox directly started fighting in the cave residence, with dust rolling.
Half an hour later, Chen Xun used the Power to Move Mountains and Cover the World technique, ending this great battle.
"Old Ox, get up. I also made a set of bandit equipment for you to walk the world!"
"Moo?!"
"Hurry up, don't dawdle, or I'll give you away."
"Moo moo!!"
Excitedly, the big black ox stood up. It was seven feet tall, and when it stood up, its physique was quite sturdy, towering more than a head taller than Chen Xun.
But due to the presence of the ox's horns, Chen Xun naturally took them into account. After putting them on, it was an ultra-large face!
However, there were too many weird people in the cultivation world. Due to the influence of cultivation techniques, there were giant men and dwarves, and the big black ox standing up most resembled a person with an exceptionally strong physique.
"Moo~~" The big black ox looked at this mighty and domineering bandit suit, completely intoxicated...
This might be what freedom feels like—a carefree sensation.
However, Chen Xun secretly chuckled on the side. Why did it look so funny?
"Moo?"
"Brother Ox is mighty!"
"Moo!!"
With a loud roar, the big black ox's stomach pouch came out. This was changed by Chen Xun, the largest storage pouch of the Five Elements Sect, just enough to hold the Black Coffin, and the storage ring was not exchanged.
Boom!
The ground in the cave residence shook, and a black coffin stood upright on the ground. It was held by the big black ox's hoof, full of death aura, and was fiercely suppressed by the Water Spirit Technique.
Chen Xun slowly stood beside it and silently drew out the mountain opening axe. They both looked outside the cave residence, and a strong wind blew through, making them stand still like statues.
Revealing the style of the cultivation world's bandits!
The man and the ox were completely immersed in it, posing for half an hour before feeling satisfied.
"Old Ox, we've been too busy these years. According to what the people from the Refining Hall said, can't this artifact also enhance formations?" Chen Xun suddenly remembered something, "Our suit also needs to be tempered with blood. There are still some things to do."
"Moo moo~"
"While wrapping things up, let's prepare."
"Moo!"
The man and the ox started to get busy again. Now that the major battle has been won, things have eased up a bit.
Over the years, Chen Xun has exchanged for quite a few storage pouches, ranging from large to small. The rare items were stored with the old ox.
They had too many things—all sorts of miscellaneous items or various books.
Every day, disciples returned to the Five Elements Sect, and even soul cultivators from the Purple Cloud Sect came to visit, making it lively.
The Sect Master was still in Wu Nation discussing the division of territory, and it was said to be a heated argument.
But compared to the surface glamor and excitement, there were still countless cultivators who were disabled in the great battle. They could only feel melancholy and helpless.
The sect had also allocated resources to help the injured cultivators, but it was still a drop in the ocean. Some injuries would accompany them for a lifetime.
Chen Xun occasionally visited Ji Kun and Shi Jing with the big black ox. It was said that Ji Kun had taken in a disciple.
Shi Jing remained silent and reserved. He always looked up at the sky, no longer having the cheerful personality he had before, completely closing his heart.
Chen Xun also inquired about Shi Jing's injuries from Liu Yuan, but she burst into tears when asked, and he could do nothing.
From Ji Kun's side, Chen Xun also gave some good pills, but they were all returned. Ji Kun said he just wanted to teach his disciples well, and he told Chen Xun not to worry about him.
Chen Xun felt helpless. A great war in the cultivation world seemed to have changed too much, and everyone was gradually drifting apart.
...
Time passed swiftly; another twenty years passed in a hurry.
Both the Qian and Wu nations had become peaceful and harmonious. The cultivation world in Wu Nation had long been suppressed in the hundred-year war and dared not raise its head; no one dared to cause trouble.
The strengths of the top ten immortal sects had greatly increased, and they recruited disciples widely. They didn't want to let go of any good seedlings from Wu Nation.
But in just twenty years, except for the cultivators who participated in the war, many people were gradually forgotten. Being able to witness the prosperity of the cultivation world was enough; who cared about so much else?
The Five Elements Sect had occupied an eighth-grade spiritual vein in Wu Nation. The construction of the mountain gate was in full swing, bustling with activity.
Nowadays, more and more new disciples have joined the sect and are stepping onto the so-called immortal path, full of hope.
The younger generation was surpassing the older generation, and the torch was being passed on.
Within the Five Elements Sect, at the Huiquan Jian Spiritual Medicine Garden.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were the old ones. They were about to leave; in just over three hundred years, the Five-Element Mixed Spiritual Roots indeed had no hope of breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage.
In these twenty years, they had added Immortal Points to their speed and the essence of all things.
Their current Immortal Points were Strength 50, Speed 90 (50), Essence of All Things 51, Spiritual Energy 90 (50), Defense 90 (50).
Over the years, the Contribution Hall was used up, exchanging books and materials. They had exchanged for advanced versions of refining, formations, talismans, and so on, using up their contributions.
They had already tempered the bandit suit with blood, and everything was neatly packed.
The big black ox had a stomach full of storage pouches, and it told Chen Xun that everything was fine.
They sat on the grass, just like they did on that day when they first arrived. The environment here was still beautiful, seemingly untouched by the ravages of time.
It seemed like nothing had changed, but it also seemed like everything had changed.
"Old Ox, do you still remember the day we took the flying boat to the Five Elements Sect?" Chen Xun suddenly looked in a certain direction, smiling, "Wow, the scene, we're taking off!"
He started to move and dance, causing the big black ox to laugh and occasionally nudge Chen Xun
It even took out the tattered straw hat that Chen Xun had not thrown away; he had suffered quite a few injuries that day.
"If this straw hat is taken out, won't it scare a lot of disciples into nightmares?" Chen Xun took the straw hat and smiled, "We are the Torture Twin Kings of the Five Elements Sect."
"Moo!" The big black ox made a charging motion. It had ambushed many people back then.
"Thanks for taking care of us, senior brothers, senior sisters, junior brothers and junior sisters, and all the seniors!"
"Moo! ~~"
"Old Ox, tidy up the Medicine Garden again, and then prepare to leave."
"Moo~"
Half a day later, Chen Xun led the big black ox to the restriction exit. They took a deep look at the Huiquan Jian Spiritual Medicine Garden, then turned and left.
