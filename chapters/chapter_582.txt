To her surprise, however, Yuan Su spoke abruptly, "A honey trap has never been about seduction by appearance; it lies in the allure of emotions. A beautiful face or a graceful figure can be found anywhere, but a heart of exquisite understanding, one that mirrors your thoughts and shares your burdens, is truly rare. Someone clever and perceptive, able to ease your worries with both wit and sincerity, is worth far more."
Yuan Su continued, "Hemian is the brightest child of our clan. She is bold and resourceful, knowing when to advance and when to retreat in the outside world. At home, she carries herself with warmth and grace, needing only a glance to understand another's intent, yet always treating others with genuine devotion and unwavering loyalty. How could anyone bear to abandon such a person? Even Li Xuanfeng could not escape this truth."
He fixed a cold gaze on the violet-robed Daoist Master before him, his voice low and measured, "To lead the wise, one must also be wise. This principle… has remained unchanged not just for the last four hundred years, but for millennia."
The violet-robed woman's expression gradually turned icy. Standing with her hands behind her back, she stared at him coldly and replied, "Tiaoxiao, you are as fond of mocking others as ever. Back then, you achieved nothing yourself. When the battle at Moongaze Lake raged for three days, you hid atop Mount Azure Pond without taking a single step—how leisurely you were."
Thunder roared across the heavens as drizzling rain continued to fall. As the violet-robed woman's face darkened, the surrounding clouds churned violently, exuding tendrils of violet mist. Yuan Su, unfazed, met her gaze with a sneer and said, "The fairy truly has a sharp memory. Yet I seem to recall who led a group of cultivators to Moongaze Lake and who was responsible for breaking Donghua's great formation!"
Their gazes locked for a tense moment before they turned away. The violet-robed woman gradually suppressed her aura and said simply, "There is no need for further words, Daoist Master. You and I have been at odds for centuries. In the end, dust will return to dust, and earth to earth. When I break through to the Golden Core Realm and turn to ash before your eyes, I trust that will finally ease your hatred."
"When that time comes, I will personally attend the ceremony." Daoist Master Yuan Su responded coldly. Without any resolution, the two parted unhappily. The violet-robed woman vanished into the Great Void, while Yuan Su, with his hands behind his back, also stepped into the void. His expression remained calm, his hands steady as stone, but his gaze was fixed ahead, as if lost in thought.
She has always been clever. She should have understood my words… At least it's some consolation, sparing her from tormenting herself year after year.
Shangyuan must have long known that the Li Family descends from Li Jiangqun, which is why he personally slew Maha as a warning. But now, I alone am fit to take action. Yet too much involvement risks exposing everything to those two.
His expression was as cold as frost, though his heart trembled as if walking the edge of a ten-thousand-zhang cliff. Trapped within the sect by my master all those years, I was unable to repay my debt of gratitude. Now… this is the only way.
His remaining lifespan was limited. He did not fear death, but he dreaded falling into the hands of a Golden Core cultivator—or worse, bringing calamity to the Li Family.
Mount Qingdu.
Li Xijun flew out of the Qingdu cave dwelling on a gust of wind, having finally broken through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Landing atop the mountain peak, he found a crowd already gathered, waiting for him.
Most of those present were boys and girls around sixteen or seventeen years old, armed with swords, sabers, spears, or bows. They waited excitedly, grouped into neat rows under the guidance of several guest cultivators, chatting quietly amongst themselves.
The Li Family's Cheng and Ming generation had grown older, and even the youngest, Chenghuai, had reached the age for cultivation. With Li Xijun emerging from his breakthrough, it was only natural for him to observe and assign them cultivation techniques.
As he landed lightly on the wind, several individuals, including An Zheyan and Chen Donghe, stepped forward and bowed. Li Xijun returned the salute briefly. Behind the guest cultivators, the gathered youths bowed in unison and called out, "Greetings, Clan Uncle!"
Li Xijun gestured for them to rise. At the forefront was a young man, Li Chengliao, now twenty-four years old and at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Considering his talent, his cultivation level was already commendable.
After a brief glance, Li Xijun nodded and said softly, "You have done well. Do you have a preference for any specific cultivation technique?"
The Li Family now possessed more than one Grade Four technique available for cultivation. These included the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique, and the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, which rivaled Grade Four techniques in quality.
The Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual had one available copy, while the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique had several. As the young family head, Li Chengliao knew these details well. He lowered his head slightly and replied softly, "I defer to Clan Uncle's judgment."
Li Xijun smiled faintly and waved his hand, dismissing the guest cultivators. Turning to the group of expectant youths, he spoke in a clear voice, "You have likely heard your elders discuss the family's cultivation techniques. The best of the grade four techniques have two distinct lineages."
Li Xijun continued, "However, though these techniques are the best, they are also difficult to master. Their spiritual qi is limited, and if one's talent is insufficient, cultivating them may instead become a hindrance. While these two techniques do not demand extraordinary talent, they still have their requirements."
His gaze swept over the gathered youths. Most of the Cheng and Ming generation displayed above-average potential, though only two or three truly stood out. Li Xijun called out, "Li Chengliao!"
Li Chengliao stepped forward and bowed deeply. Li Xijun said softly, "You are the most talented among the Cheng and Ming generation and the young family head. The Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual is yours to cultivate."
Li Chengliao bowed again. Li Xijun then pointed to a young woman, the eldest sister of the first lineage, named Li Minggong. Radiant and poised, her talent was comparable to Li Chengliao's. She was assigned the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique.
The last person he selected was the youngest son of the second lineage, Li Chenghui. Quiet and reserved, Chenghui stepped forward and whispered to Li Xijun that he wished to cultivate the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, with permission already granted by Li Qinghong.
Li Xijun nodded and made note of it. The remaining youths were allowed to choose their techniques, with only five copies of the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique Manual available. Four others were selected based on merit, while the rest were left to pick freely from the Grade Three techniques.
After assigning the techniques, Li Xijun led Li Chengliao and Li Chenghuai away. Once inside the secret chamber of the cave dwelling, he took out a talisman pill and said softly, "This is the family's secret Breaking Realm Pill. Take it in silence and do not speak of it to others, lest they covet it."
Li Chengliao nodded solemnly and entered a stone chamber within the dwelling to begin his secluded cultivation. Only then did Li Xijun sit down with Li Chenghuai.
Chenghuai, just over seven years old, sat on the stone stool, a little bewildered, as Li Xijun gently covered his eyes with his hand. Chenghuai spoke softly, "Uncle Eight…"
Li Xijun responded with a soft hum, his tone gentle as he said, "I am sealing your six senses. Be patient for a moment."
Once Chenghuai agreed, Li Xijun sealed his six senses and carried him into the secret chamber. Before a cold, silent stone altar, he kneeled and recited a prayer, "…The Li Family of Qingdu offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion… When the time comes, I will remain true to my oath. With this talisman burned, I express my gratitude to Supreme Yin."
After finishing the incantation, Li Xijun's heart sank bit by bit. The bluish-white Immortal Mirror above remained utterly still, unresponsive. Pale, moonlit mist flowed downward, settling lightly on the stone bricks below.
Silently offering his apologies, Li Xijun rose slowly, lifted Li Chenghuai, and left the secret chamber without a word. Exiting the cave dwelling, he stepped onto the summit of Mount Qingdu.
Sitting on the stone steps at the peak, he released Chenghuai's sealed senses. The full moon shone brightly, its light spilling across the landscape. The boy looked up at him, then leaned quietly against his chest.
Li Xijun forced a smile, wrapping his arms around the child as they sat in the mountain breeze. In a soft voice, he said, "Tomorrow, Uncle Eight will take you to the Technique Transmission Hall to choose an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation technique."
"Alright," Li Chenghuai replied softly.
