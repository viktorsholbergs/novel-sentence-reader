Their pace was slow, and layers of mysterious mist continuously shrouded their path, a route they might never tread again.
The Grand Illumination Mystical Array continued to operate, and the two senior brothers at the entrance were no longer the same as before.
Chen Xun smiled at them, then led the big black ox to report at the Alchemy Hall, stating that due to the limited lifespan, he intended to leave the mountain to get married.
Time passed swiftly, and the Alchemy Hall saw many changes in personnel.
Senior Sister Zuo was said to have gone to the front line, and it had been a long time since anyone had seen her. It was unclear whether she had achieved a breakthrough or met her demise.
Ruan Zheng was stuck at the middle Foundation Establishment stage and eventually passed away. Chen Xun, at that time, led the big black ox to pay respects and perform rituals for him.
After the elders of the Alchemy Hall verified everything without issue, their expressions turned somewhat surprised. This junior disciple had never left the sect's spiritual medicine garden since breaking through the Foundation Establishment stage. With a touch of respect, they retrieved the restricted token and dissipated the blood essence.
Leaving the Alchemy Hall, they were now free individuals. They had made outstanding contributions to the sect, and although they could retire in the sect, they could also leave on their own.
Chen Xun walked with the big black ox on the rugged mountain path. All around them, the scenery was lush, and it was springtime, with flowers blooming.
"Moo?" The big black ox rubbed against Chen Xun.
"Let's not inform them. We'll quietly leave later. Why make it so sentimental?" Chen Xun understood the big black ox's meaning, considering whether to inform Senior Brother Ji and the others.
"Moo~" The big black ox struggled for a moment but nodded.
"Old ox, do you like the light feeling now?" Chen Xun took a deep breath, then exhaled slowly. "Living apart is better than dying and saying goodbye."
The big black ox's pupils contracted, stunned by Chen Xun's sudden statement. It halted its steps, and there was no more struggle in its eyes.
They weren't planning to leave immediately. Instead, they wandered around, appreciating the scenery, and then would leave for good.
"Old ox, look over there!" Chen Xun suddenly became excited, pointing to a valley where a sea of red spread out—a maple forest that seemed to extend into their hearts.
"Moo~"
"On the sword!"
Swish!
Swish!
...
One person and one ox stood on immortal swords, traversing through the mountain peaks, roaring down, and stirring countless red leaves. Chen Xun and the big black ox were filled with joy on their faces.
A tall and straight maple tree stood in the center of the maple forest, radiant as if it were a sea of clouds.
The spring breeze and the maple leaves sang together; the azure sky above was deep and distant, and beams of sunlight streamed through, illuminating the two figures.
Chen Xun looked up at the sky, holding the big black ox, stepping on the leaves within the maple forest, his eyes filled with shock.
"Old ox, enjoy your freedom!"
"Moo~"
As Chen Xun's words fell, the big black ox excitedly ran out, sniffing around, and occasionally stood still, its eyes also filled with delight.
After so many years in the Five Elements Sect, they hadn't discovered this treasure until they were about to leave.
Chen Xun leaned against a maple tree, hands behind his head, and a relaxed smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.
He was quite tired in these years. Although he was grateful to the Five Elements Sect, after experiencing everything, he found that he didn't particularly enjoy staying in the sect.
Now, both he and the old ox were not novices in the cultivation world. They had some self-preservation abilities and would no longer be haunted by demonic beasts.
A map of the Qian Nation unfolded slowly in the air.
"Hehe, it's really nice..." Chen Xun chuckled softly, closing his eyes slowly, and the map was put away in the storage pouch.
The scorching sun tore through the mist. At this moment, rays of sunlight penetrated the maple forest, as if even the light had taken on a shape, warming the time and the years.
At this moment, the big black ox was still running around Chen Xun, but seeing him fall asleep didn't disturb him.
In this vast and magnificent cultivation world, countless people left behind a trail of bones as they struggled forward, never stopping.
Perhaps only this man and his ox were still enjoying another side of the cultivation world...
A day passed like this. Chen Xun was still resting, and the big black ox, tired of playing, sat down and closed its eyes.
The next day, Chen Xun was still resting, and the big black ox glanced at him, gently putting on the straw hat. The sunlight was a bit dazzling.
From time to time, male and female disciples would come to the maple forest, seemingly making it their secret meeting place.
When they saw the junior brother and his spirit beast, they were shocked and hurriedly ran away, avoiding disturbing them. The rendezvous could wait for next time.
On the third day, the big black ox completely relaxed, starting to doze off with its belly exposed.
In these hundred years, it seemed like they had never been so relaxed. The deepest exhaustion within them finally began to dissipate.
Beams of orange light shone above them, and occasionally, birds perched on their shoulders and heads.
The wind stirred, and maple leaves gently fell, covering Chen Xun's face. He remained tranquil, seemingly blending into nature.
With a thought, the spring breeze rose; with another thought, an old friend arrived.
A woman stood in the distance, her eyes filled with astonishment as she looked at the man lying under the ancient maple tree, her lips slightly parted.
Harmony with the light!
She didn't know why this phrase popped into her mind. She was shocked and thought, "Junior Brother Chen Xun, are you really a Foundation Establishment cultivator..."
This woman was Liu Yuan, and although she didn't know much about Chen Xun, having seen too many cultivators, she felt he was genuinely special.
After a while, Liu Yuan smiled knowingly, realizing that it was just her wishful thinking. According to the time, Junior Brother Chen Xun's lifespan was not much.
Experiencing what happened with Shi Jing, she understood the value of people around her. She and Shi Jing used to come to this maple forest frequently.
But now, Shi Jing won't come anymore. He just sat there every day, lost in thought.
The man under the distant maple tree opened his eyes, still drowsy, and looked at the woman. "Senior Sister Liu."
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox slowly opened its eyes, looking around with a confused expression. Suddenly, it saw Liu Yuan, and a hint of nervousness appeared in its eyes.
"Junior Brother Chen, Black Ox."
Liu Yuan smiled gently, her voice clear. She wore a white dress, and she had matured a lot.
Due to her significant victory, she obtained many cultivation resources and was now a Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivator, receiving special attention from the sect.
Shi Jing had been completely given up, and several of their master’s ten direct disciples also suffered casualties.
Seeing the unnatural expression in the big black ox's eyes, she seemed to think of something but didn't reveal it.
Chen Xun gently removed the maple leaves from his face, smiling and saying, "Didn't expect to meet Senior Sister Liu here."
"Junior Brother Chen, any plans for the future?" Liu Yuan walked over gracefully, a fragrance wafting through the air. "The sect is currently lacking Foundation Establishment cultivators, and there may be better opportunities in the Wu Nation."
"Hehe, Senior Sister Liu is considerate."
Chen Xun shook his head, looking at the densely packed maple leaves penetrated by sunlight. "Junior Brother has no other aspirations. Enjoying the breeze and daydreaming is enough."
Maple leaves fell, and for that moment, it felt like the world stood still, not even the wind breathing.
Liu Yuan's smile seemed to deepen. She nodded, then turned and left. It was good as long as Junior Brother Chen could let go.
