The Short Staircase
* * *
“…………”
Another door… behind the room guarded by the two floating skeletons.
After confirming that my wounds had healed to a certain extent, I pushed open the door, and there I saw stairs.
An eerie, pale blue torch illuminated the dimly lit room, with few windows.
Only the sound of the wind whistling through the gaps echoed strangely.
Those stone stairs…
I’m climbing them, my footsteps echoing—kotsu-kotsu.
『Brave one… you’ve finally made it this far…』
『The only evil lackey of the Superbad Empire left… is their leader, General Tekigataa.』
『But… don’t let your guard down.』
With every step I take, the princess’s illusion appears in the dimly lit room, says a single line, and then disappears.
『Tekigataa Frozend.』
『The archenemy of our great Yoiyattsu Kingdom… the evil that must be defeated.』
『A cunning commander, as well as a brutal greatsword user… and the possessor of a terrifying special ability that turned me into a doll.』
『The man who deserves to die the most.』
The princess is still expressionless.
Her words are also monotonous.
But what I can sense from them… is hatred… for this General Tekigataa.
『Please…』
『Defeat General Tekigataa.』
『Help me.』
『Please save me.』
『I can’t take it anymore.』
『Help me.』
『Help me.』
『Help me…』
And her desire to be saved.
Help me, save me… The princess repeats that.
<She’s been turned into a doll, and imprisoned in this fort… for five hundred long years… Her pleas are naturally desperate.>
“…………”
Five hundred years… huh?
She couldn’t even move an inch during that time…
It’s natural that she’d be desperate.
But.
…But…
<…Emi? What’s wrong?>
Well…
I understand that it can’t be helped…
But I think… she’s pitiful.
<This… princess?>
…Well, the princess is definitely pitiful too.
But… her words…
I can’t help but feel… something’s off.
<Something’s off?>
Yeah.
Because, Extra-sama…
That princess… never once…
Hmm?
I was climbing the stairs, ignoring the princess’s words from halfway through.
And just then, I reached the top.
And there I saw—
A large, beautifully decorated door. It was so grand that I involuntarily stopped my conversation with Extra-sama and looked at it.
『General Tekigataa awaits you, beyond this door.』
The phantom princess, looking at me staring at the door, said—
『His weakness is fire magic. Please… I wish you luck in battle.』
And then, after giving me that last, useless piece of strategy information… she disappeared.
Well, anyway.
…Shall we?
I kicked the door with all my might.
BANG… GAGOOH…!
The door fell to the floor with a loud sound… and a cloud of dust rose.
“…………”
Silently, I stepped into the room without hesitation.
It’s a large, empty room.
This room has more windows than the staircase, so even though the weather outside is ominously cloudy, there’s enough light.
Placed at the far end of the room is a female doll, whose appearance looks familiar.
Her eyes closed, her hands clasped in prayer, she doesn’t move an inch.
Yes… it’s the real body of the phantom princess.
And standing before her is a large skeleton, clad in rugged, jet-black armor.
His giant greatsword, as tall as he is, is stuck in the floor.
He—
The master of this fort… General Tekigataa—
『Gufufu…! I never thought that the challenger I’d waited five hundred years…would be such a… beautiful girl! Gufufufufu! Black hair and black eyes! That ominous aura is also good!』
He laughed creepily, his eye sockets on me!
And then!
『AAAAAH!! I want to add her to my collectionーーー!!!』
General Tekigataa shouted that, easily lifted his greatsword with one hand and swung it casually!
That single movement… caused the entire fort to shake from the wind pressure…!
