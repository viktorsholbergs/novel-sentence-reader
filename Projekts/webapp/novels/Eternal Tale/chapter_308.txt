"This is just a small matter, Daoist Friend, no need to be so polite," Baili Wentian said heartily. "I wonder what other business brings you here. We have already understood Commander Zhonghu’s intention."
The Jiuhua Patriarch remained silent, recalling the God-killing Wind of the Tian Duan Plains. The expulsion array had involved all the major powers...
But no one spoke of it. The decision was not theirs to make—it was all ancient history now.
"Heh, we’ve come to exchange for some ordinary Nascent Soul-level cultivation techniques. Qian Nation lacks resources, and its inheritances have been severed," Chen Xun's eyes gleamed slightly as he looked at the Jiuhua Patriarch, then at Baili Wentian. "Rest assured, we won’t ask for anything related to your core legacies—just ordinary techniques will suffice."
Both figures frowned slightly—why did it feel like there was a deeper meaning behind his words?
"What type of spiritual root does Daoist Friend have?" Baili Wentian sighed softly. "Nascent Soul techniques are indeed precious, but my Baili Clan has preserved many."
He felt a trace of unease toward Chen Xun. For someone to rise to such heights despite cultivating in a resource-scarce realm, their wisdom, temperament, and ability had already surpassed countless cultivators of The Great Li Realm.
The Jiuhua Patriarch's gaze was sharp. He couldn’t see through this big black ox at all, nor did he know its race, yet a lingering sense of dread remained in his heart.
Other than the small lion, neither this man nor this ox was as simple as they appeared—there was something terrifyingly immense hidden within them.
Chen Xun cupped his hands solemnly. "I require techniques for all five elemental roots as well as Heavenly Spiritual Roots. We will give our all in this battle."
" Moo~" The big black ox retrieved a storage bag, which was filled with exceptionally rare spiritual herbs, all over five thousand years old!
"My Baili Clan will do our utmost as well. We understand Daoist Friend’s intent," Baili Wentian stated firmly.
"As will my Jiuhua Sealed Demon Ape Clan!"
At those words, the heavens and earth seemed to change color. Gales howled through the surroundings, and an atmosphere of killing intent descended upon the land.
This battle was not just the concern of a few individual cultivators.
"Many thanks."
"Moo moo~"
"Roar roar!"
Chen Xun, the big black ox, and Little Red all expressed their heartfelt gratitude—some things simply could not be accomplished by them alone.
"Daoist Jiuhua."
"Speak, Daoist Friend."
"May I borrow two drops of Golden Core blood essence from the Jiuhua Sealed Demon Ape Clan? I have two three-thousand-year-old Yuanchen Ginsengs in exchange."
Chen Xun looked somewhat embarrassed and hurriedly produced his offering. "These herbs should help replenish its vitality."
"Hahaha! Daoist Friend, you are far too polite. It’s nothing—just a mere drop of blood essence," the Jiuhua Patriarch laughed heartily, his massive body trembling with mirth. His voice resounded in all directions. "Ying, come here!"
"Old Ancestor!"
A colossal figure came bounding over from the distance, its white fur gleaming brilliantly under the sunlight. It roared in response, "What’s the matter?!"
"Give me two drops of your blood essence!"
"Ah?"
Ying abruptly halted in its tracks, eyes widening in disbelief. It had thought it was being summoned for battle! "You…"
Boom!
A massive fist shadow descended from the sky, leaving a deep crater in the ground. Ying let out a miserable cry before it could even finish speaking, its limbs twitching violently from the blow.
The Jiuhua Patriarch was swift and decisive, forcibly extracting two drops of blood essence from the fallen ape before casually tossing it the two-spirit herbs that Chen Xun had given.
Chen Xun and his companions twitched slightly at the scene—these ancient beasts were truly fierce. Their efficiency left no room for unnecessary negotiations.
"Daoist Friend Chen Xun, take it."
The Jiuhua Patriarch lifted his colossal palm, sending the two drops of Nascent Soul blood essence directly into Chen Xun’s hands. He then added, "Should you need anything, come find me in the mountains—sparring matches included!"
"Daoist Jiuhua." Chen Xun cupped his hands and let out a hearty laugh. "Many thanks!"
"Moo moo!" The big black ox’s eyes gleamed—it was eager to spar and deepen their bond through battle.
Little Red let out a sigh of relief. He hadn’t expected his clan to have such a connection here. It seemed that the Ten Thousand Mountains were quite safe after all, home to many powerful spirit beasts.
Just then, an immense pressure slowly emanated from Baili Wentian.
His robes billowed in the wind as he spoke in a deep voice, "Daoist Chen Xun, once the bow is drawn, there is no turning back. We will be waiting for you."
Chen Xun’s gaze was profound. A vast and mighty spiritual pressure surged in all directions, causing the surrounding mountains to hum in resonance. Many spirit beasts trembled, their spiritual energy momentarily stagnating!
Facing Baili Wentian, Chen Xun remained calm. "When we stir chaos on the Domain Battlefield, you will see for yourself."
"Moo~" The big black ox exhaled through its nostrils, standing steadfastly beside Chen Xun.
Baili Wentian locked eyes with Chen Xun. His blood was boiling—this spiritual pressure… He believed three parts of it already. He nodded heavily.
The Next Day, in a Baili Clan,
The camp housed many Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators. Chen Xun and his companions casually strolled along its outskirts, observing.
These cultivator soldiers were entirely different from ordinary cultivators. They practiced the Baili Clan’s inherited techniques, training day and night without pause.
Unlike most cultivators who had to search for resources, these soldiers were fully supported. Every year, major forces of the Great Li Realm provided them with vast cultivation supplies.
First, to maintain good relations. Second, because the Baili Clan had suffered immense losses—no generation had ever seen a cultivator live to the end of their natural lifespan. They never competed for treasures in The Great Li Realm’s secret realms either.
Such a reclusive yet powerful clan commanded deep respect from the ruling powers of many great sects.
Inside the camp, over a thousand cultivators sat cross-legged, their blood energy surging, resonating faintly with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. Before each of them was placed a large, blood-red fruit.
Chen Xun’s eyes lit up—this was the legendary Chaoyuan Scarlet Treasure Fruit, an innate companion fruit of the Jiuhua Sealed Demon Apes. When these ancient beasts were born, celestial phenomena would accompany their arrival.
This fruit greatly benefited body refinement. Even the tree’s branches and leaves could be used to brew medicinal liquid for body tempering as early as the Qi Refining stage—though that was a luxury only the wealthiest sects could afford.
Ancient texts recorded that the Chaoyuan Scarlet Treasure Tree took a hundred years to bloom and a thousand years to bear fruit, with no known upper limit to its age. It was undoubtedly far superior to the Jade Origin Fruit.
However, once removed from the territory of the Jiuhua Sealed Demon Apes, the tree could not survive—not even water-element techniques like the Water Spirit Art could sustain it.
Chen Xun had already acquired the fifth layer of the Water Spirit Art from Yu Jingxin’s storage ring. He planned to test its principles here at the Baili Clan before beginning cultivation.
"Moo moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun—it wanted a branch from the Chaoyuan Scarlet Treasure Tree.
"Don’t worry, Old Ox."
Chen Xun smiled slightly, then glanced at Little Red. "With this fruit, you’ll be able to break through to late-stage Nascent Soul even faster."
"Brother Xun, there’s no rush." Little Red scratched his head, grinning innocently. "You and Brother Ox have more important matters. I still have plenty of lifespans left."
"Moo!" The big black ox immediately smacked Little Red on the head with a hoof—everything is important!
Chen Xun walked forward slowly, deep in thought, ignoring their antics.
These were all precious cultivation resources, the kind that could be sold for spirit stones in the greatest immortal sects.
He could also send them back home—his people had no decent body refinement techniques.
At this thought, his divine sense spread across the military camp. The Baili Clan’s patriarch had mentioned that the person he sought was here.
But instead of having someone introduce him, Chen Xun chose to observe from the shadows—he already knew a few cultivators from Qian Nation to begin with.
