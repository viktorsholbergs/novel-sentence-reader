Chapter 18: The Demon Bird
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Lu Yang’s knowledge about the world of cultivation was far from comprehensive. Before joining the Dao Seeking Sect, his knowledge came solely from storytellers. In his year at the sect, his understanding of cultivation grew at an astonishing pace, but his readings didn’t cover something as mundane as how to disembark from a flying boat. Who would write about such things?
In terms of common knowledge about life in the cultivation world, he was less knowledgeable than Peach Blossom Leaf, who had grown up in a cultivator family.
His understanding of flying boats was limited. He knew they were part of the assets of the Land of Gold Commerce, and disembarking involved jumping off, but the exact method was unknown to him.
The flying boats brought in enormous profits annually, but for the Land of Gold Commerce, this was just a minor part of their business. The company, the largest on the Central Continent, had a mysterious backing and countless treasures. With enough spirit stones, one could buy anything, even legendary items like relics from the Buddha’s Land, sacred bones from the Demon Territory, or celestial fruits that were normally only heard of in tales.
If anyone dared to owe the Land of Gold Commerce or steal from them, the fate of several vanished powerful cultivators served as a warning to the world.
Legend spoke of a cultivator known as the “King of Thieves,” skilled in the way of space, who could effortlessly steal others’ storage spaces. Distance was meaningless to him, and he could cross thousands of mountains and rivers in a single step. He had even stolen from Tribulation Stage cultivators.
There was an unwritten rule among thieves: never steal from the Land of Gold Commerce. The “King of Thieves” initially adhered to this tradition. However, as his fame grew and many high-profile cultivators failed to capture him, he began to feel invincible and above the old teachings.
He arrogantly announced that he would steal a treasure from the Land of Gold Commerce that night. People speculated about a silent heist or a fierce battle inside the company. But, to everyone’s surprise, nothing happened that night, and the “King of Thieves” disappeared without a trace.
Lu Yang’s awkwardness lasted only briefly. When it was time to jump off the boat, the strangers were too busy to keep looking at him.
Everyone opened their paper umbrellas and leaped down, one after another. Lu Yang and Peach Blossom Leaf followed suit. In the sky, several strangers with their umbrellas looked as tiny as sesame seeds from afar. Lu Yang was different; when he pulled the string on his back, his parachute opened with a “pop,” standing out conspicuously in the high sky.
Normally, Lu Yang would be very nervous at such a high altitude, but at that moment, he had no room for such thoughts.
It was just too embarrassing.
Fortunately, everyone had different destinations. Only Lu Yang and Peach Blossom Leaf were headed to Taiping Village.
Upon arrival, they were warmly welcomed by the village head, who seemed to have been expecting them.
“Two esteemed immortals, you’ve finally arrived. The way you descended from the flying boat was truly extraordinary.”
Lu Yang opened his mouth but ultimately didn’t ask why the village head knew when they would arrive.
“My name is Lu Yang, and this is Peach Blossom Leaf. We’re both disciples of the Dao Seeking Sect. The description of the demon bird in the mission was not very detailed; we would appreciate more information from the village head.”
The village head initially planned a welcoming feast with drinks and local specialties, a common practice for entertaining officials. However, Lu Yang and Peach Blossom Leaf were all business, much to the village head’s delight and admiration for the discipline of sect disciples.
Peach Blossom Leaf observed the village head, noting his late stage Qi Condensation cultivation level. His early training had been inadequate, leaving impurities in his spiritual energy and making Foundation Establishment unlikely. He was a typical cultivator, nothing extraordinary.
The village head’s expression turned troubled when mentioning the demon bird. Taiping Village was already isolated with few outsiders, and the news of the demon bird had scared off even the traveling merchants.
He reported the incident to the authorities in Quhe County, but they were short-handed and, seeing that the demon bird hadn’t harmed anyone, decided to wait and see, promising to send someone when they could spare the manpower.
That was twenty days ago.
“About twenty days back, tailor Feng made a commotion, claiming that a man-eating demon had visited their home and it was fearsome,” the village head recounted.
“The neighbors were alarmed upon hearing this. A man-eating demon was no small matter. Taiping Village had about thirty cultivators in total, and I, as the village head and the highest in cultivation, was approached by Feng and the neighbors.”
“Before exorcizing the demon, it’s important to understand the situation. So, I asked Feng, ‘You mentioned a man-eating demon, but who did it eat?'”
The danger posed by a demon that had tasted human flesh compared to one that hadn’t was significantly different. Humans, being the most spiritually aware of all beings, leave a lingering taste that demons crave, leading them to hunt for more victims, bringing calamity to the region.
“Feng replied that he didn’t know who the demon had eaten but insisted it must have because it spoke human language.”
Indeed, rumors in the mortal realm suggest that demons gain the ability to speak and transform into humans after consuming them, but these are exaggerations.
For a demon to speak human language, it must refine the hyoid bone in its throat, achievable only at the later stages of Qi Condensation.
“Feng thought it was just a lost bird from the forest until it perched behind him and watched him sew without moving. Suddenly, it spoke, scaring Feng enough to make him flee his shop.”
“Seeing that Feng couldn’t provide any useful information, I decided to approach the demon bird discreetly, leaving the others to wait at a distance. That’s when I saw it.”
“The demon bird’s feathers were vibrant and glossy, with distinct red around its eyes, clearly no ordinary bird. No ordinary bird would dare flaunt such striking features.”
“The demon bird asked me, ‘Who are you, and where is Zhang Guanjia?’ with an urgency in its tone.”
“I was puzzled. Zhang Guanjia is a cultivator from our village, at the third level of Qi Condensation, nothing outstanding. It was strange to think he had any connection with a demon.”
“I tried to appear non-threatening and politely asked, ‘May I know why the esteemed demon seeks Zhang Guanjia?'”
“Without answering, the demon bird flapped its wings and left the tailor’s shop.”
“Since then, the demon bird has been flying around Taiping Village, feasting on crops and speaking human language. Although it hasn’t harmed anyone, the mere sight of a demon is enough to instill fear in mortals. Consequently, everyone has been living in fear these days, worried that the demon bird might unleash its ferocity and devour us all.”
“Have you fought the demon bird? What’s its strength like?” inquired Lu Yang.
The village head shook his head. “The demon bird is elusive, always in the sky, making it hard to track.”
“Moreover, I can’t gauge its cultivation level, which means it’s at least at the same level as mine, the seventh level of Qi Condensation. I worry that attacking it recklessly might provoke it unnecessarily, especially if it harbors no ill intentions towards humans.”
Lu Yang nodded, understanding the village head’s cautious approach.
