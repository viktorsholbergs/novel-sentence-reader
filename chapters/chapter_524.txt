Fearing any potential interference from Buddhist cultivators, they traveled quickly. By dawn the next day, the Profound Peak Gate's territory in Shanji Prefecture soon came into view.
An elderly man greeted them, his appearance plain with two small moles on his face. His body, adorned with various jade pendants, clinked as he moved. He greeted them with a hearty laugh, "Kong Yu of Profound Peak Gate greets fellow Daoists!"
Years ago, when Kong Yu was invited by Li Xuanxuan to move mountains for the Li Family, he had told him about the One Stick of Incense Clan. This man could be considered a friend of Li Xuanxuan. At that time, Li Yuanjiao was in seclusion and had not met him, but Li Qinghong had.
"Greetings, Senior," she replied politely.
"Ah! Please do not call me that. You are flattering me too much!" Kong Yu smiled wryly.
When he first visited the Li Family, Li Qinghong was still in the Qi Cultivation Realm, and it had been reasonable for him to act like a senior. Now, in the blink of an eye, she had become a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and Kong Yu dared not act overly familiar, humbly declining the honor and asking, "How is Daoist Xuanxuan faring?"
"My father is in good health," Li Yuanjiao replied. After exchanging a few more pleasantries, several young disciples flew up from below, all at the Qi Cultivation Realm.
They gazed at the two of them with admiration and greeted them respectfully, "Greetings, Seniors!"
Li Qinghong, still looking youthful, was dressed in jade armor and silver boots, exuding a heroic spirit. The male disciples of Profound Peak could not help but stare, clearly both in awe and fear, making Kong Yu visibly embarrassed.
"Naturally, no one dared to look at Li Yuanjiao, whose more mature appearance gave him a villainous air. He quietly observed the group of disciples, thinking to himself, Their cultivation is even lower than Xijun's, and they don't look like disciples from a major sect... They must not be from the sect's core lineage."
After everyone had gathered, they set out swiftly, riding the current downstream, heading toward the Eastern Sea.
Wutu Peak.
Li Ximing slowly exhaled, and it seemed as though two bright flames flared up in his eyes, flickering and rising before turning into a golden light that gradually faded into nothingness. With a light inhale, he swallowed the Long Marching Fire Essence before him into his belly.
Two years ago, he had taken a talisman pill to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Afterward, he diligently cultivated, refining his strength, and now his cultivation was fully consolidated.
Li Tongya's generation lacked medicinal pills, and refining one's cultivation was a slow and painstaking process that could take three to five years. By Li Ximing's generation, however, pills were much more plentiful. Li Ximing himself had no shortage, so his progress was swift.
With a flick of his hand, he revealed a jade bottle containing an Essence Gathering Pill and thought to himself, Brother Zhi gave me this pill… but I don't really need it. It would be better to leave it for Xijun…
Li Ximing was not one to boast, but when it came to cultivation, he was brimming with confidence. His heart was set on the Dao, and he had a spirit fire from heaven and earth in his belly. Over the years, through the practice of dual cultivation and absorbing fire, he had faintly sensed that he was in alignment with this path, giving him a strong assurance of success in reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.
Despite his confidence, Li Ximing hesitated. Failing to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm meant the end of one's life and Dao. If it were anyone else, even with a ninety-nine percent chance of success, he would keep the matter to himself and not risk letting it slip.
But Li Xijun was not just anyone. In Li Ximing's life, there were very few things he truly cared about, and Li Xijun, the younger brother who visited him earnestly every day, was one of them. It was difficult for him to part with that bond.
Gritting his teeth, Li Ximing placed the jade bottle on the table, resisting the urge to take it. He locked the door behind him and turned to leave.
In front of him stood Meng Zhuoyun, her black hair flowing loosely, with the ends tied in a red ribbon and adorned with a small blue-gold orchid. Needing a distraction from the Essence Gathering Pill, Li Ximing pulled her into his arms.
Meng Zhuoyun pouted slightly but began to undress, almost out of habit. Li Ximing muttered under his breath while she remained passive, hesitant as though making a decision.
Suddenly, she asked, "Brother Ming, will you keep me?"
Li Ximing frowned, as though repeating himself for the hundredth or two-hundredth time, "You can handle it on your own."
Lost in his own thoughts, Li Ximing's actions were automatic. Their bodies had long since become accustomed to each other, moving naturally, yet both were distracted. Meng Zhuoyun placed her hands on his chest and suddenly spoke, "Li Ximing."
It was the first time she had called him by his full name, and he was taken aback. Softly, Meng Zhuoyun continued, "You are only relying on the Li Family… You think you are a genius? You are just living off the shadow of your forefathers, stripping away everything the Li Family has given you. What can you truly call your own? Hmm..?"
Sweat dripped down Meng Zhuoyun's graceful face as she panted softly, yet her eyes remained calm. She spoke in a quiet voice, "Even without a prestigious background, Li Yuanjiao could be a fierce general, Li Xijun could be a swordsman, and Li Xicheng could be a manager… But you? You are nothing but a coward."
Li Ximing closed his eyes, as though her words had touched a sore spot. After several breaths, he whispered, "Stop… just stop talking…"
Meng Zhuoyun pushed his hands away, exhaling deeply before saying softly, "I will be leaving."
Without hesitation, she stood up and emptied the contents of her storage pouch. Pills, secret technique manuals, paintings, and Li Ximing's clothes—all of it came tumbling down onto him.
Nearly overwhelmed by disbelief and caught completely off guard, Li Ximing watched as Meng Zhuoyun draped a robe over herself. She cast a Purification Spell on herself, then walked out of the courtyard, her black hair flowing behind her, her expression resolute.
She had barely taken a few steps forward when she saw a white-robed young man standing in the forest, blocking her path.
With sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, he held a sword in his arms. Though Meng Zhuoyun looked disheveled, her pale skin exposed, the young man respectfully averted his gaze, his expression polite.
Meng Zhuoyun shook her head gently, the blue-gold orchid in her hair glinting under the moonlight. Her soft eyes were clear and filled with defiance as she asked, "What do you want, Senior?"
Li Xijun extended his hand politely and said, "I hope you would allow me to inspect your storage pouch."
Meng Zhuoyun bowed and handed over her storage pouch. Li Xijun examined it carefully and found nothing related to his family. He apologized and returned the pouch but still did not move aside.
Left with no other option, Meng Zhuoyun cast a spell and swore a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, vowing not to disclose any of the Li Family's secrets. Still, Li Xijun did not relent, his gaze lowered in guilt as he added softly, "I have heard that you are skilled with a painter's brush?"
Though his tone remained courteous, the Hanlin sword on his back glowed ominously. Meng Zhuoyun was not foolish and immediately understood, adding a few more assurances to her vow. Only then did Li Xijun apologize, "You have made many pills for our family over the years… It is Brother Ming's fault for treating you unfairly. This is to compensate you for all the pills you have refined."
He untied a storage pouch from his waist and respectfully handed it to her. Meng Zhuoyun's face changed, a mix of shame and frustration rising within her. But seeing the genuine sincerity in Li Xijun's eyes, she knew he did not intend to humiliate her. Silently, she accepted it and whispered, "Thank you."
With that, she soared into the sky, vanishing into the distant horizon.
Li Xijun sighed and stepped into the courtyard, which remained in disarray. Li Ximing quietly fixed his attire. Li Xijun let out a bitter laugh and said, "You made a mess, yet I have to be the one to clean it up…"
Li Ximing said nothing. Hanging high in the courtyard was a painting. In it, Li Ximing wore a smile, yet his expression was cold and emotionless. His eyes were indifferent, as though lost in deep thoughts.
Irritated by the sight of it, Li Ximing waved his hand, summoning the painting. He folded it and tucked it into his robe before waving his brother out.
Turning back, he gathered the scattered paintings in the courtyard. Suddenly losing interest, he pulled out his alchemy furnace and returned to refining pills.
