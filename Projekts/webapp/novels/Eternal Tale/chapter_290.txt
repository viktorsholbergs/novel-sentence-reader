Just as he finished speaking, a figure clad in white appeared in the distance. The man looked to be in his early twenties, dressed in a white long robe and wearing a jade crown.
With his gentle demeanor, he truly embodied the phrase: "A gentleman as warm as jade, unparalleled in the world."
Chen Xun walked alongside him with a faint smile. Although their attire differed significantly in quality, Chen Xun's calm and composed aura was in no way inferior to Yu Jingxin's.
At first glance, the two walking together seemed a bit incongruous, but upon closer observation, they appeared surprisingly harmonious.
“May I ask which generation of the Yu family you belong to?”
Yu Jingxin's eyes flashed slightly. He had not encountered Chen Xun before, as he rarely interacted with other Yu family members. He cupped his hands in a polite gesture and replied, “I am Yu Jingxin.”
“I am Chen Xun,” the other replied.
The two strolled leisurely along the small path, basking in the morning sun.
“I am not a member of the Yu family,” Chen Xun explained. “I am merely a guard who saved a member of the Yu family from a lion demon a month ago.”
“Haha, so that's how it is,” Yu Jingxin replied with a smile, his curiosity now satisfied. No wonder Chen Xun seemed so at ease mingling with mortals. Yu Jingxin did not doubt him further; as a cultivator in the early Nascent Soul stage, he knew mortals could hardly deceive him.
Yu Jingxin studied Chen Xun a bit more closely. The latter exuded an almost transcendent aura, devoid of any hostility—a rare quality among cultivators.
Using his Soul Transformation-level powers, Yu Jingxin examined Chen Xun thoroughly. Since no unfamiliar Soul Transformation-level cultivators could exist within the Yu family’s territory, he was naturally unperturbed.
Unbeknownst to him, Chen Xun, empowered by system-enhanced spiritual insight, had also analyzed Yu Jingxin thoroughly, completely surpassing his awareness.
“What is Brother Chen’s view on the relationship between cultivators and mortals?” Yu Jingxin asked casually. This time, he addressed him not as a "fellow Daoist" but in a manner more akin to mortal conversation. “To be honest, I quite enjoy buying oranges at the market below the mountains.”
“Haha!” Chen Xun burst out laughing at Yu Jingxin’s serious demeanor. “There’s no real difference, is there? People are people. I come from an ordinary background, and I’ve never considered myself noble.”
“You’re quite the unique character, Brother Chen,” Yu Jingxin said with a warm smile, his eyes showing a trace of nostalgia. “I’ve always believed that the mortal realm is far better than the world of cultivation.”
Chen Xun nodded emphatically. That was an undeniable truth.
The people of this world were remarkably honest and kind-hearted. Even martial artists carried a chivalrous spirit.
“Brother Chen agrees?” Yu Jingxin’s smile deepened as he noticed Chen Xun’s earnest nod. “But after stepping into the world of cultivation, the phrase I hear most often is still ‘the divide between mortals and immortals.’”
“Brother Yu, your situation is different. You’re from an ancient cultivation family—your status already places you at a certain height,” Chen Xun remarked with a chuckle, finding their conversation easy and natural. “For those of us who are mere wandering cultivators, things aren’t quite so bleak.”
“True,” Yu Jingxin sighed softly. Although his status was exalted, it also shackled him from the moment he was born. “Mortals envy immortals, but how often do immortals envy mortals in return?”
This man has a story, Chen Xun thought, raising an eyebrow. Hearing such words from a Soul Transformation-stage cultivator carried a unique resonance.
“Everyone has their own brilliance, just like that orange seller said.”
With that, Chen Xun pulled an orange out of his storage ring and handed it to Yu Jingxin. “Brother Yu, don’t overthink it. Have an orange.”
Yu Jingxin was momentarily stunned but then accepted the orange with a smile. “Haha, thank you, Brother Chen.”
“No need to be so polite,” Chen Xun replied, taking out another orange for himself. The two of them continued down the path, eating their oranges slowly as if savoring every bite.
After a while, Yu Jingxin spoke again. “Brother Chen, how about we go to an inn and share a drink? My treat.”
“I’m on duty and can’t leave the Yu family grounds for now. Besides, I don’t drink.” Chen Xun quickly waved his hand, producing a cup of herbal tea. “Brother Yu, I only drink health teas.”
“Oh? May I ask why, Brother Chen?”
Yu Jingxin furrowed his brows slightly. It was the first time he had heard of someone not drinking alcohol. This Brother Chen truly was an unusual person.
“When I was in the mortal realm, my master once said that drinking while treating illnesses could hinder the healing process. So, he gave me a recipe for health teas to nurture my body and mind,” Chen Xun explained earnestly, his face serious. “That’s why I’ve never touched alcohol. I can only turn down your kind offer, Brother Yu.”
Yu Jingxin looked at him deeply. This person was truly exceptional. Having met countless people, Yu Jingxin could discern that Chen Xun’s temperament and aura were unique, unlike anyone he had ever encountered.
“No need to worry about your duties,” Yu Jingxin said, raising a finger. He sent a sound transmission talisman flying toward the distance. “Let’s go to a tea house instead and listen to some storytelling.”
“Haha, that sounds great,” Chen Xun replied with a laugh. Free entertainment was always good. “Please, Brother Yu.”
“After you.”
Yu Jingxin, in a relaxed manner, felt it was rare to meet someone he enjoyed talking to at the Yu family. They didn’t discuss matters of the cultivation world but rather talked about lighter topics, such as life and enjoyment.
The two figures continued down the path, gradually moving farther away toward the city, enjoying each other’s company.
In the days that followed, Chen Xun continued with his duties as usual, collecting his monthly salary. No one caused him trouble, and he continued gathering information about Long Guanzi within the Yu family.
Yu Jingxin occasionally allowed him to take time off, and the two would go to the city to drink tea together, living leisurely lives. They often went to buy oranges at the market below the mountain as well.
However, Yu Jingxin was quite generous. Every time they went out, he would give extra money, even when they listened to the storytelling in the city. He gave such a large reward that the storyteller, who was initially only going to tell one segment, ended up adding two more after seeing the generous tip.
Two months later, at night.
The soft moonlight gently bathed the earth, illuminating the flowing stream and lighting the flame of tomorrow’s sunrise.
In a small pavilion under the moon, Yu Jingxin and Chen Xun sat facing each other. Yu Jingxin drank wine while Chen Xun sipped tea.
“After cultivating for over a thousand years, I’ve never been as carefree as Brother Chen,” Yu Jingxin said, raising his glass to Chen Xun. He drank it all in one go and then spoke meaningfully, “But someone like you, Brother Chen, I don’t believe you’ll stay here for long.”
“Brother Yu jokes. This is the place that wandering cultivators dream of,” Chen Xun responded with a calm smile. “For us, just surviving is a struggle.”
“After two months, it seems you’ve already figured out my identity,” Yu Jingxin said.
“Ha, the old ancestor of the Yu family has been talked about by many. They say I’ve had great fortune,” Chen Xun replied, still unfazed. His eyes showed no surprise as if he had known all along.
Yu Jingxin inwardly thought, as expected. Someone with this temperament couldn’t possibly be an ordinary cultivator. He definitely wasn’t a Nascent Soul cultivator.
“I wonder what Brother Chen’s purpose is in coming to the Yu family. I might be able to offer some help,” Yu Jingxin said, his gaze distant as he stared at his wine glass, speaking slowly. “Ah, Brother Chen truly isn’t a simple person. It seems my eyes were too dull.”
“Actually, Brother Yu, you’re quite to my taste as well,” Chen Xun replied, his smile soft and warm.
Yu Jingxin smiled back, the image of the perfect gentleman. “It seems our meeting was inevitable. There’s no such thing as coincidence in this world.”
Chen Xun smiled but didn’t respond. Instead, he shifted the conversation.
“The Yu family has three ancestors, but only the third ancestor possesses the divine summoning technique. Furthermore, he cultivated an external incarnation named Long Guanzi.”
“Indeed, many core disciples of the Yu family are aware of this,” Yu Jingxin replied.
“Then it seems Brother Yu has already guessed my identity,” Chen Xun said.
“Indeed,” Yu Jingxin nodded softly, his gaze still distant. “You are that cultivator from the Forbidden Sea, huh? Haha, fate is truly remarkable.”
As soon as the words left his mouth, the atmosphere grew tense. The world seemed to hold its breath as though everything had come to a standstill.
The night sky was deep and black, the moonlight cold and serene, and the clouds silently drifted by, gazing down at the two figures in the small pavilion.
