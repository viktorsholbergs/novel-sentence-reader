“Moo~”
The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, whose face was slightly pale, a sign of having forcibly absorbed too much icy, yin energy, which would undoubtedly lead to backlash.
Chen Xun remained calm, gently patting the big black ox’s head and nodding slightly.
It was only then that Little Red noticed Chen Xun’s condition. Still caught up in the awe of how his “Brother Xun” had slain countless enemies just moments before, he had completely forgotten the karmic consequences of killing the corrupt beasts.
“I’m fine. Old Ox, steer the ship to the right. I’ll take some time to recover,” Chen Xun said, his expression serene as he gazed into the distance, his mind full of questions. “Set sail. We also need cultivation techniques of the Nascent Soul level. The Baili clan will help us.”
“Moo!”
“Got it, Brother Xun!”
The big black ox and Little Red both nodded vigorously and set to work. Their thoughts were simple—being with their leader was enough. Whatever he said, they followed.
Buzz!
The giant boat rose slowly into the air with a thunderous roar. Streams of radiant light rippled across its hull as it began accelerating.
The vessel surged into the boundless darkness, its figure flickering and elusive, speeding onward.
Chen Xun sat cross-legged on the deck, slowly closing his eyes as a cool breeze brushed past him.
His body brimmed with the icy, yin energy of the domain battlefield. Letting it flow freely, his face grew increasingly pale.
Having slain so many corrupt beasts, even someone as resilient as he was could feel the loss of vitality. It was a suffocating, despair-inducing sensation.
Gradually, Chen Xun came to realize that the so-called “karma of slaughter” was just an intimidating name.
In truth, the real cause was the icy yin energy of the battlefield. This was the essence of life-draining energy—the negativity of the world and all living beings, forces in opposition to vitality.
The corrupt beasts merely used this energy for cultivation, serving as vessels for its accumulation, and had developed a so-called “life-slaying technique” through it.
Chen Xun was certain that when these corrupt beasts killed living beings, they too lost vitality, though perhaps to a lesser degree. Just like living beings, they advanced their cultivation through destruction.
For them, spiritual energy was still a toxin. These beasts, though seemingly mindless, were anything but.
However, their characteristics set them apart. The corrupt beasts seemed to endlessly spawn from that mysterious azure-gray sky. Their fearless attitude toward death and their entirely alien thought process were unlike any living beings’.
Moreover, the black mountains that connected to the eerie black soil of the land served as their true stronghold.
Even the Forbidden Sea, tainted by their corrupt blood, couldn’t completely transform into a realm like the black soil. At best, it became a dead zone where spiritual energy could not exist.
Still, given the current state of affairs, it was clear that killing corrupt beasts drained far more vitality from living beings than the reverse. This battlefield concealed countless cosmic secrets.
“If I ever find the way forward, I must drag a newborn corrupt beast along with me,” Chen Xun muttered, a sly smile gradually curving his lips. “The Nascent Soul stage seems to be missing something. Right now, finding the path is the key.”
These corrupt beasts seemed to be biding their time as well. Chen Xun and his companions had killed far too many of them and seen things that ordinary cultivators could never comprehend.
This domain would eventually erupt into an apocalyptic war akin to the ancient times.
Those ancient warships, silent for millennia, still bore the wills of the domain’s fallen warriors in the Forbidden Sea.
The Baili clan, who stood at the forefront of all living beings, the ancient clans guarding the heavenly gates, and countless other cultivators of this realm...
As these thoughts churned in his mind, Chen Xun’s aura became increasingly sharp. In a world on the brink of collapse, no one could remain untouched.
This time, he resolved, he would no longer stand idly by. It was time to do everything within his power.
Perhaps it was time for them to ignite the flames of this domain’s final war ahead of schedule.
At that moment, the icy yin energy within the heavens and earth seemed to momentarily stagnate. A terrifying battle intent erupted on the deck of the giant boat, spreading outward and enveloping the surroundings.
Traces of destructive divine power leaked from Chen Xun’s body, swirling around him before returning to his nose and mouth.
A new divine aperture was forming within him, slowly but steadily opening.
Atop the crane’s head, the expressions of the big black ox and Little Red shifted drastically as they suddenly looked toward their leader.
“Brother Ox...”
“Moo!”
The big black ox exhaled a heavy breath, glancing at its elder brother, whose eyes were half-closed. It could sense Chen Xun’s thoughts. No matter where he decided to go, it would follow him unwaveringly and forever.
Its gaze gradually sharpened, shedding all traces of its once-honest and simple demeanor.
Little Red cast a deep look at Brother Xun. The seemingly carefree Brother Xun, the one who haggled over a few thousand low-grade spirit stones, the one who always wore tattered linen robes.
Buzz
The colossal ship roared through the heavens like a sharp, piercing sword, slicing through the endless darkness of the domain battlefield.
The big black ox’s eyes narrowed as it, too, began cultivating, working to open its divine aperture. Meanwhile, five figures stood in five directions on the ship, each wielding a formation flag, slaying the corrupt beasts attempting to block their path.
Little Red’s aura was also rising. His storage ring was filled with jet-black stones and thousand-year-old spiritual herbs, and he began his own cultivation as well.
Time flows unceasingly, day and night.
The giant ship had already been sailing through the domain battlefield for two years.
They had continued to invest their longevity points into improving their defenses.
The black-soil land lay desolate. Atop a massive black mountain, three figures stood at the summit. Around them, the corpses of corrupt beasts had piled up into a mountain, and black blood flowed ceaselessly down from the peak.
The area was strewn with the remains of living beings. Occasionally, a blood-stained battle flag could still be seen fluttering. They had now entered the true Great Li battlefield.
On the ground and in the air, corrupt beasts climbed relentlessly. Driven by hatred, they could sense the rich vitality and essence of the living beings present.
Whoosh!
Suddenly, a sinister wind swept over the black mountain. Wherever it passed, the corrupt beasts froze, their pupils contracting before collapsing lifelessly to the ground.
This place seemed like a graveyard for the corrupt beasts, with the mountain of corpses growing higher and higher—a terrifying sight.
“It seems we’ve arrived.”
“Moo~”
“Brother Xun, there don’t seem to be many Nascent Soul-level corrupt beasts here. We haven’t encountered any yet.”
Three calm voices echoed at the mountaintop as they overlooked the land below, their tone devoid of fear toward the corrupt beasts.
Whoosh!
Whoosh!
In the distance, a dozen streaks of light sped toward them. Judging by their attire, they appeared to be rogue cultivators from Great Li Realm, unaffiliated with any sect. Their expressions were panicked, as they were being pursued by a late-Foundation Establishment-level corrupt beast.
“Run! These corrupt beasts can conceal themselves! Our divine sense can’t detect them at all!”
“Damn it! We’ve provoked a late-Foundation Establishment corrupt beast, and we can’t kill it!”
“Huang Shao, entering the War Realm camp isn’t easy. You need to present a corrupt beast’s head to prove yourself!”
“I know that!”
As they exchanged frantic words midair, their faces were filled with frustration and dread. The domain battlefield was far more terrifying than any secret realm, rife with peril. Even killing the enemy required constant caution.
Suddenly, a thick scent of blood filled the air, and a massive black mountain abruptly came into view.
Their pupils contracted violently. Why would there be a black mountain in a place like this?!
According to the warnings from the rearguard camp by the Heavenly River, one must stay far away from the black mountains. They were guaranteed to harbor Nascent Soul-level corrupt beasts!
What’s more, they had a map of this region. How could a black mountain appear out of nowhere? This wasn’t even a main battlefield!
Everyone’s faces fell, their bodies trembling uncontrollably. Behind them was the pursuing late-Foundation Establishment corrupt beast; ahead was the threat of Nascent Soul-level corrupt beasts. It was a death trap.
Huang Shao and Dai Xinqing exchanged a glance, cold sweat soaking their backs. After years of cultivation, they had finally encountered a crisis beyond their ability to overcome.
