Li Xuanfeng flew for half a day, using the water veins to traverse for quite a while before Splitreed Island appeared in view. Breaking through the sea surface, he landed in the marketplace.
"Hmm?" Li Xuanfeng scanned his surroundings. The marketplace was eerily empty, devoid of people. It was a mess, with clear signs of fighting and spells clashing everywhere. Occasionally, he spotted a few disciples of the Azure Pond Sect, all silent and withdrawn.
Frowning without a word, he swiftly rode the wind toward the main hall.
The grand hall of the marketplace was resplendent with gold and jade, its highest point shimmering with streams of light and defensive formations. As Li Xuanfeng walked a few steps, he noticed that the usual guards were absent, which deepened his suspicion, "Even Ning Heyuan is nowhere to be found… What has happened here?"
He stepped into the hall and immediately saw a man in azure robes seated on the white jade throne. The man's cheeks were slightly rounded, and his eyebrows long. His calm eyes carried an unquestionable sense of authority.
He lounged against the throne, his jade-like fingers lightly holding a small golden jade seal. His other hand rested on the armrest, rhythmically tapping it.
Kneeling below him in splendid robes was Ning Heyuan, his head pressed to the ground, trembling visibly. His legs were tightly joined, and he remained silent, like a statue.
Li Xuanfeng took a step forward. The radiant mana of his black-gold armor shimmered as he bowed, his head lowered as he said in a soft voice, "Xuanfeng greets the Daoist Master!"
The man before him was none other than Daoist Master Yuan Su, Ning Tiaoxiao himself!
As Li Xuanfeng kneeled, he cast a glance at Ning Heyuan. The latter's eyes were shut tight, his forehead dripping with sweat, leaving the jade floor damp. Whatever Yuan Su had told him earlier must have left him thoroughly shaken.
Daoist Master Yuan Su smiled faintly, giving Li Xuanfeng a once-over before speaking, "The Black Tiger Eyes has been in my possession for a long time. Its sharpness and weight make it too taxing for most to wield. I have kept it hidden in the clan for ages. It seems a good fit for you."
Li Xuanfeng cupped his fist in thanks, barely able to utter polite words before Yuan Su continued casually, "These younger members of the Ning Family are all so inept… While you are stationed here, teach these juniors a lesson or two so they do not end up causing any trouble."
Li Xuanfeng humbly replied that he dared not refuse. Daoist Master Yuan Su chuckled, nodding as he added, "You have done well in this matter."
Hearing this, Li Xuanfeng realized that his efforts had been acknowledged, and his earlier deductions about the situation were largely correct. He allowed himself a moment of relief.
Yuan Su glanced at Ning Heyuan and then back at Li Xuanfeng, praising him, "To detect irregularities, recognize the workings of fate, and identify these Fated Ones, all while knowing how to strike a balance between forming ties and avoiding entanglements—this is the path to safety and wisdom."
Li Xuanfeng understood that Yuan Su was using his commendation as an indirect reprimand for Ning Heyuan. He remained silent while Ning Heyuan finally muttered, "This junior has learned his lesson…"
Yuan Su rose from the jade throne, his hands clasped behind his back as he coldly remarked, "If I had not arrived in time, you would have thoroughly disgraced the Ning Family! Do you even understand what qualifies as destiny or who these destined individuals are?"
Ning Heyuan dared not breathe too loudly. Li Xuanfeng pondered silently. Yuan Su glanced once more at Ning Heyuan and said firmly, "Leave! Reflect on this thoroughly!"
Ning Heyuan nodded, murmured his thanks, and left with heavy steps. Yuan Su exhaled, turning to Li Xuanfeng, "This child is still young. Though he has improved somewhat through the years of tempering, his vision remains too narrow. With Ning Wan focused on cultivation and unable to spare the effort, I will need you to keep an eye on matters here."
Li Xuanfeng vaguely understood the nature of Ning Heyuan's mistakes. Considering the Ning Family's aid, he spoke softly, "Daoist Master, please do not be too angry. The workings fates are enigmatic; not all fault lies with Heyuan…"
Hearing his plea, Yuan Su huffed, but his stern expression softened considerably. He spoke warmly, "You were born with great strength, a rare gift of the heavens. Coupled with your extraordinary acuity, you are a natural talent for the bow. Well done. I once met a Buddhist cultivator in the north during a visit. He, too, was endowed with immense strength—greater even than yours. He later became The Merciful One's Vajra guardian, quite a formidable figure."
Yuan Su mentioned it casually, and Li Xuanfeng listened in silence. The azure-robed Daoist Master pondered for a moment before suddenly speaking, "Yuanwu will not miss the Green Pine Temple, and Yu Muxian will definitely go there."
Li Xuanfeng was slightly taken aback, then lowered his gaze and replied, "Thank you, Daoist Master."
Ning Tiaoxiao fixed his gaze on him and spoke softly, "In Green Pine Temple, divine abilities cannot interfere. If something truly happens to you, I will not be able to intervene. Though Yuanwu has cultivation, he cannot match me, but I still cannot confront him over trivialities."
Li Xuanfeng bowed deeply and replied, "Xuanfeng understands."
Yuan Su nodded lightly and said gently, "I know your heart is with your family. If this mission succeeds, you should consider it as putting the past to rest. Settle down and focus on cultivation."
Li Xuanfeng prostrated himself in gratitude. By the time he rose, the azure-robed Daoist Master had already traversed the Great Void and disappeared. The suffocating pressure that had lingered around him vanished as well. Li Xuanfeng stood, his expression contemplative.
It seems Yuan Su understands the feud between my family and the Yu Family. He wants me to kill Yu Muxian, allowing my family to annex Moongaze Lake, which would settle the debt with the Li Family once and for all…
Yuan Su's intentions were clear. While outwardly saying he could do nothing if something happened to Li Xuanfeng in the grotto-heaven, he was subtly implying that if Yu Muxian fell, Yuanwu would also have no grounds for retaliation.
Furthermore, Yuan Su, although at the early Purple Mansion Realm, was evidently stronger than Yuanwu at the mid-stage. He could easily cover for Li Xuanfeng if things escalated. If a direct confrontation arose, Yuanwu would ultimately fall short against Ning Tiaoxiao.
"Yuan Su… truly remarkable…" Li Xuanfeng had only vaguely heard of Yuan Su's jade seal, an ancient spirit artifact of extraordinary power, but he had not realized that Yuan Su could so openly dismiss Yuanwu's prowess. It was no wonder other Daoist Masters rarely left their mountains and diligently guarded their sects, while Yuan Su could act freely in the Southern Border.
This demon-slaying mission had concealed layers of trials, from interpreting Yuan Su's intentions to handling the threads of fate tied to the Fated Ones, and finally showcasing his strength by slaying the demon without allowing it to escape. Clearly, Yuan Su had been assessing Li Xuanfeng's abilities in all aspects.
As he pondered, Li Xuanfeng slowly walked out of the grand hall. Ning Heyuan was waiting outside, his expression a mix of shock and trepidation. He shook his head with a bitter smile and said, "Thank you, Brother-in-law."
The grand hall had not been closed, and the conversation within could naturally be overheard. Ning Heyuan had caught snippets while leaving earlier. Li Xuanfeng was not surprised and merely asked, "What happened?"
Ning Heyuan appeared deeply regretful, his demeanor downcast, as he said, "Somehow, greed overtook me. I tried to snatch a treasure away from a Fated One. I got the treasure, but the look of hatred in his eyes… they have certainly borne a grudge against me."
"I see…" Li Xuanfeng's thoughts aligned closely with this explanation. He nodded slightly.
Ning Heyuan continued, "I had just secured the treasure in my hands when the Daoist Master emerged from the Great Void and turned that person into a mist of blood. Only then did I realize the gravity of my mistake—but it was already too late! Ah, who knows how much longer I will be stuck in this wretched place!"
