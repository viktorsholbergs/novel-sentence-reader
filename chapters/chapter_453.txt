"The annual profit was a mere thirty-two Spirit Stones, totaling only one hundred and sixty over five years," Li Yuanping continued thoughtfully.
Fortunately, with the Peak Guardians appointed, they could be sent to the remote areas of Mount Dali to gather qi. With monthly rotations, this yields an additional seven Spirit Stones annually.
"With the inclusion of the gathered qi, the total comes to one hundred and ninety-five Spirit Stones, just about ten to twenty away from the required tribute amount," he added with a satisfied nod.
The gap of only three or four Spirit Stones annually was manageable. Since most talismans crafted by his father, Li Xuanxuan, were distributed as rewards, covering the deficit was relatively straightforward.
"Conversely, with the new system implemented, our control over our own territory has more than doubled. The number of personnel at our disposal has increased tenfold, significantly enhancing our influence over the neighboring families and those on the eastern shore..." he continued.
These developments—distributing benefits, stabilizing the cultivator groups under their command, and securing the populace's loyalty—were all within Li Yuanping's expectations. Just as he was pondering how to further capitalize on these changes, someone approached him.
"Seventh Uncle, Ximing is getting ready to break through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm," Li Xijun reported, bowing slightly.
Li Yuanping nodded silently, offering a smile but then gently asked, "Have you considered taking a wife, Jun'er?"
At the age of twenty-one, Li Xijun's early advancements in Qi Cultivation Realm made him appear youthful. However, he was still at the first heavenly layer, highlighting the growing gap in talent with his brother, Li Ximing, who was advancing even faster.
Li Xijun occasionally brought joyous news to Li Yuanping, hoping to bridge the gap between the father and son. However, Li Yuanping seemed uninterested and instead posed a personal question to him.
"I've met the daughter from An Family…but I don't think it'll work out," Li Xijun replied truthfully.
Li Yuanping sighed, but did not ask if it was the girl or just that his nephew was not interested in the relationship. He simply murmured, "You'll have to decide for yourself... I hope you'll at least leave an heir.
Li Xijun shook his head gently.
"Big Brother has many heirs, and the second lineage already has successors. Xijun will leave it all to fate. Retaining Yang Essence and practicing certain secret techniques could also prove advantageous."[1]
After chatting briefly, Li Yuanping watched his nephew depart on the wind back to Mount Qingdu to focus on either his cultivation or swordsmanship.
He could not help but remark, "This child excels in many areas… He's sharp, diligent, and always dedicated to his swordsmanship day and night. However, he's emotionally reserved and harbors an inherent pride that makes it difficult for others to relate to him..."
Li Qinghong, standing nearby, pursed her lips.
"It's partly my fault. When Jun'er was young, his father, Brother Yun, faced hardships. As a result, he was exposed to many two-faced people. This inevitably shaped his reserved and cautious nature…"
"With his remarkable appearance, innate talent, and early experiences that taught him to see through people, it comes as no surprise that he's prideful. Considering everything, I think he's fine… he could have turned out to be way worse."
As Li Qinghong concluded, Li Yuanping stared into her almond-shaped eyes and suddenly chuckled.
"Jun'er truly takes after you. You're really his aunt," he remarked.
Li Qinghong was taken aback, but as she saw Li Yuanping's pale face breaking into a strained smile, he hoarsely added, "Someone in the family has also chosen to remain unmarried for life, even sacrificing her lifespan to pursue the dao. She has a remarkable appearance, innate talent, wits, and pride too… Yes, I'm talking about you, Li Qinghong!"
Meanwhile, at Mount Dongli…
The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven was approximately the size of a prefecture. This once-majestic realm, filled with immortal mountains and sprawling structures and pavilions, now lay in ruins. Vibrant spirit fires were spreading in every direction amidst billowing black smoke.
Yuan Tuan, accompanied by Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er, landed on a modest hill. The peak assigned to Yuan Tuan was notably smaller and less impressive due to Qingsui Peak's declining power. It appeared that little of value could be found in this unassuming location.
Li Xizhi stepped into a small courtyard on the mountain. Yuan Tuan remained mounted on a deer as she instructed gently, "Go and search. Bring back Qi Cultivation and Foundation Establishment Realm items to the peak. Items of the Purple Mansion Realm should be submitted to the main peak. Ensure pill recipes, cultivation and secret manuals are archived within the sect. Do not disseminate them widely, and avoid trying anything funny. Remember, the grand formations are watching us."
Yuan Tuan, lacking strong backing within the clan, knew better than to aim for the central peaks, where the most valuable treasures were likely kept. Instead, she chose not to vie for access, avoiding unnecessary conflicts.
The courtyard was littered with broken bookshelves and various spirit items scattered on the ground, shimmering with spiritual energy. Yuan Tuan scanned the place with her spiritual sense, then reached out to pick up a shimmery fragment from the ground.
With a tone of regret, she remarked, "A fine Crying Blood Stone... What a pity... Chu Yi's greed has devastated the grotto heaven, destroying at least thirty percent of the spirit treasures within..."
Inside the courtyard, Li Xizhi sifted through the debris of collapsed medicine cabinets and found several stacks of prescriptions. Upon closer inspection, one was prominently labeled—Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill, written by Cui Niexiang.
Dongli Sect preferred to use durable spirit cloth for their records to minimize damage. Li Xizhi swiftly scanned the information with his spiritual sense. Continuing his search, he found yet another prescription—Two Ways of Refining Renewal Spirit Pill, written by Cui Er.
It contained two methods of refining this spirit pill, one for the Qi Cultivation and the other for the Foundation Establishment Realm. This delighted Li Xizhi as he thought to himself, Ming'er is a skillful alchemist. This recipe will surely benefit our family!
Meanwhile, Yang Xiao'er approached, holding a stack of documents, looking as though realization had just dawned upon her.
"Brother! The Cui family of the Dongli Sect indeed originated from the north, and their heritage is deeply tied to the ancient Wei Kingdom. It's no wonder they use Yang and Li Fire as their emblems..."
Li Xizhi immediately recalled the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual back home, authored by Cui Mu of the ancient Wei State. A surge of hope filled his heart as he wondered, Could this grotto heaven hold the key to my family's destiny? If I can find the Purple Mansion Realm part of the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual here, it could revitalize Brother Ming's Dao!
His heart raced with the possibility, but anxiety soon crept in. The three sects and seven gates had long divided this grotto heaven among themselves. How could he possibly find an opportunity there? He'd probably be killed by disciples of the same sect as soon as he left this peak…
Despite his concerns, he mused aloud, "I wonder if there are any Grade Five or Grade Six cultivation techniques hidden in this grotto heaven… Securing one would certainly be a remarkable feat."
Yuan Tuan, overhearing him, shook her head slightly and murmured softly, "Don't get your hopes up. Aside from Chu Yi, the Li Fire Spear, no one else can unlock the Dongli Dao Collection."
After their brief exchange, they swiftly plundered the main courtyard atop the mountain before descending to continue their scavenging, as instructed by Master Yuan Tuan.
As Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er made their way down, Yuan Tuan's brow furrowed in contemplation.
Yang Tianya claimed that Li Mutian truly existed... Could it be that there was really a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator named Li Mutian in Yang Tianya's forces? How did he meet an untimely end though? The clan seems oblivious to this, and their records mention only three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in their family...
What was Daoist Master Yuan Su thinking when he chose Ning Hemian as Li Xuanfeng's wife... Whose pawn is the Li Family..?
The deeper Yuan Tuan delved into these thoughts, the more bewildering the situation seemed. Meanwhile, down the mountain, Yang Xiao'er called out to Li Xizhi warmly and excitedly, drawing Yuan Tuan's gaze downward.
Watching Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er, she reminisced about her senior brother who had long left the sect and was never to return, leaving her behind. Her eyes reddened slightly at Yang Xiao'er's affection for Li Xizhi.
Regardless of the turmoil outside, my immediate priority is to protect the young ones at our peak.
