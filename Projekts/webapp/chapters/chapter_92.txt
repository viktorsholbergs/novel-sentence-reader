Mu Jiaoman descended gracefully from the air, prompting the clan shamans and tribesmen below to immediately drop to their knees and respectfully greet, “General.”
Ignoring the greetings of those around him, Mu Jiaoman glanced sidelong for a while. He felt his left eyelid twitching as he observed Li Jingtian who kept her head bowed.
Having been a Qi Cultivator for over a decade, Mu Jiaoman had never experienced such involuntary movements before, let alone the feeling of breathlessness and the inability to avert his gaze.
“She…” Mu Jiaoman began to utter a word, but the surrounding clan shamans and tribesmen nodded eagerly.
“We know, General. We know!” they said with an understanding smile.
Mu Jiaoman, having spent so many years in the tribe, knew what the others were implying. Observing Li Jingtian’s resentful gaze, he tried to clarify himself but eventually chose silence instead of explanation.
The tribesmen quickly led Li Jingtian away. Mu Jiaoman turned around coldly, then soared into the air once again under everyone’s gaze.
As he moved through the air, Mu Jiaoman suddenly felt an elation tempting him to abandon his usual restraint. Yet, he maintained his composure as he made his way to the tent.
Meanwhile, Li Jingtian was escorted into the stronghold. She was released, and her face was washed clean of the mud before it got painted on with the colorful pigments commonly used by the Mount Yue tribe, the colors extending to her neck.
She was then dressed in Mount Yue clothing, adorned with feathers, beast fangs, and shiny jades. The wild outfit and accessories actually added a regal air to her natural beauty, leaving the elders attending to her in awe as the movements of their hands slowed.
By the time the lengthy preparations were complete, the sky was already dark. Li Jingtian was being led into a dimly lit military tent, where she overheard a gruff voice as soon as she approached the entrance.
"The Great King gave his command for us to head west in order to guard against any disturbances at the sandbank. The general was to organize the rear troops and escort the slaves to the Great Jueting first. Meanwhile, I was ordered to lead a troop of a thousand strong to pursue the foreign forces…”
“How did it go?”
Li Jingtian recognized the deep and hoarse voice. It belonged to the long-braided Mount Yue general she saw during the day.
“...I gave chase, but the man led his troops into the depths of Mount Lijing without even looking back. I was afraid of startling the great demons in the mountain, so I withdrew the troops…”
Mu Jiaoman frowned, slightly tightening his grasp around the cup in his hand as he asked skeptically, “You led the charge yourself, yet that man still managed to escape? I thought he was only a cultivator of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.”
The Mount Yue tribesman who was kneeling on the ground quickly lifted his head and was about to explain just as Li Jingtian entered the tent. The beast fangs she wore clinked against the jade stones.
The man quickly glanced behind him, appearing equally stunned as Mu Jiaoman.
Accustomed to the rugged appearance of Mount Yue women with entangled and muddy hair, neither of them had seen such a woman with bright eyes, white teeth, and a clear, piercing gaze.
Both men were momentarily lost in their thoughts.
Damn, no wonder why the ancestors had always spoken of the beauty of mortal women!
Li Jingtian, however, observed them quietly. Seeing their diverted gaze, she recalled the dagger hidden in her clothes, which had been confiscated.
She heard faint discussions about her father outside and was anxious to hear more, yet she was pushed into the tent instead. Now, in the presence of these two men, she maintained her composure.
The tribesman kneeling on the ground gulped audibly, snapping Mu Jiaoman back to his senses. He shot a glare at the man, then cleared his throat. He was going to chase Li Jingtian out of the tent, but the words that came out of his mouth were—“Please wait outside.”
As Li Jingtian turned around and exited the tent, the tribesman stumbled over his words while attempting to respond to the earlier question, “I-I… H-He…”
Upon calming himself down, the tribesman mustered the courage to speak under Mu Jiaoman’s angry gaze.
“The man seemed to be blessed by the gods. He effortlessly evaded every trap we laid out and even summoned a demonic creature to his aid. The creature disregarded hundreds of them and focused its relentless attacks only on us…”
“I’ve heard enough! Get out of here!” Mu Jiaoman, no longer interested in hearing the man’s excuses, dismissed him with a wave of his hand. Noticing the man’s reluctance to leave the area after exiting the tent, Mu Jiaoman let out an annoyed snort. The fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm’s aura radiated from him, frightening the man into a hasty retreat.
As Li Jingtian was pushed back into the tent by a clan shaman outside, Mu Jiaoman abruptly rose from his seat but quickly sat back down again. His demeanor was fraught with the same nervous anticipation he had felt during childhood when he was assessed for a shamanic orifice.
He met Li Jingtian’s gaze, then slowly began, “You…”
Li Jingtian remained unfazed as she stared right back at Mu Jiaoman, who was physically stronger than her.
“Lay a finger on me and I’ll end my life right here in this tent,” she hissed through gritted teeth.
Her bold statement surprisingly eased her tension.
If I die here, Xuanling won’t have to worry about me. He’ll be able to escape easily alone…
Mu Jiaoman quickly waved his hands, then gently asked, “What’s your name?”
Li Jingtian immediately grew wary, furrowing her brow as she quietly responded, “Ye Tian.”
Knowing she could not reveal her true identity, she quickly fabricated a name. Observing Mu Jiaoman’s stoic face, Li Jingtian could not help but wonder why the leader of Mount Yue was panting so badly.
Mu Jiaoman, who was captivated by Li Jingtian’s frown, felt a turmoil of emotions he had not experienced in his decades of loyal service to Jianixi. It terrified him and he could hardly remain calm.
No, I must keep this woman out of Jianixi’s sight.
“Young Family Head, Mount Yue has completely withdrawn!”
Li Xuanxuan’s gaze was fixed on Mount Lijing, his expression fraught with worry, when suddenly the voices of the clan soldiers below broke through his thoughts.
Their proclamation filled him with relief and he glanced around at the expectant faces surrounding him, feeling a surge of responsibility.
Second Uncle has set out westward in search of Third Uncle. The burden of the family falls on me now. In times of crisis like these, I, Li Xuanxuan, must remain vigilant!
He reminded himself sternly, clenching his fists in determination.
The situation was dire. With Li Qiuyang and Chen Donghe accompanying Li Xiangping to the territories of Mount Yue, there was only a handful of inexperienced young cultivators left at home, aside from his aunt, Liu Rouxuan and Li Xuanfeng, who had attained the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.
“We must first assess the damage and casualties at Lichuankou Village and Lijing Town,” he declared.
Liu Rouxuan, who looked like she was still in her twenties rather than thirties due to her immortal cultivation, nodded in agreement as she gazed toward the west in concern.
“Leave Lichuankou Village to me,” she said.
“Tianchou,” Li Xuanxuan called out. Wan Tianchou quickly stepped forward, listening attentively to Li Xuanxuan’s instructions.
“You’ve been stationed in Lichuankou Village for many years. Since you know the area well, please accompany my aunt on her journey.”
After receiving a nod of understanding from Wan Tianchou, Li Xuanxuan exhaled deeply and said, “I’ll personally oversee the matters in Lijing Town.”
