Li Yuanping's eyes gleamed brightly as he went on, "Looking at today's situation, many of the external and branch cultivators are stealing spirit paddies, searching for treasures, transporting spirit resources, and seeking the Dao outside because there are no other paths to take within the family aside from cultivating spirit paddies. Without the opportunity for advancement, there is naturally no loyalty."
Finally, he concluded, "Under this new system, not only would our family no longer need to find large talentless direct descendants to manage the family and maintain stability, but it would also create positions and ranks that would attract people to align with our family…"
Li Yuanjiao read through the detailed regulations. Naturally, Li Yuanping had included much more than he had mentioned verbally. The plan was filled with various checks and balances, cultivation restrictions, and measures to curb corruption and rebellion.
"If this is the case, the Clan Affairs Courtyard will need many more personnel for oversight, and the various ranks will require clan stipends to maintain integrity…" Li Yuanjiao frowned as he read, realizing that while Li Yuanping's plan could indeed appease most cultivators, it would significantly increase the Li Family's governance costs. He hesitated, weighing the potential benefits against the losses.
However, Li Yuanping smiled confidently and responded readily, "Cultivating immortality and seeking the Dao is inherently one of the most greed-driven pursuits. Our family will soon be able to produce elixirs. Once these are tied to the ranks, many will flock to them! Besides, the desire for power is one of the Nine Calamities; when combined with other incentives, few can resist."
He added in a low voice, "As long as the external and branch families are eager to climb the ranks, they can be used by us. We will not need to rely on producing a genius every generation who can suppress and command them; even ordinary people will suffice. Even in normal times, we could promote people at will based on the lists provided by the Clan Affairs Courtyard… This would allow us to manage the family even in the midst of cultivation."
Li Yuanjiao gradually became intrigued, picking up where Li Yuanping left off, "This way, our family would not need to constantly monitor the external families. As long as we keep an eye on a few outstanding individuals and marry them into the family, the mirror will keep everything under control, allowing us to secure our position on the immortal mountain…"
"Exactly."
Li Yuanping agreed and continued, "Even if we have to distribute more clan stipends, so what? Brother, you are about to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm; the family will soon be very different."
Li Yuanjiao finally nodded in agreement, saying, "But in the end, it is because we descendants are unworthy, unable to concentrate power in one person, so we must delegate power and benefits to maintain stability. I just wonder… I just wonder how we will face our ancestors."
Li Yuanping nodded silently, comforting him, "Maximum benefit does not always mean maximum stability. As our family continues to expand, division of power will become inevitable… We cannot afford to lose."
Li Yuanjiao spoke with him for a while, feeling heavy-hearted, and then set off for Mount Wutu, intending to spend some time stabilizing his cultivation before entering seclusion to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.
Mount Yuting.
The snow on Mount Yuting remained pristine and bright. Li Xijun opened his eyes, exhaling a breath of white mist that collided with the longsword in his hand, forming a thin layer of frost.
"The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual is indeed a Grade Three technique, cloaking me in dew and snow, allowing me to ride on cold winds."
His white robes fluttered as his power reached the first heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. His true essence was as pure as frost which was swirling all around him, and combined with the sharp blade in his hand, he appeared untouched by the world.
In just over two years, three members of the Xi and Yue generation had broken through in succession, adding three Qi Cultivators to the Li Family's main lineage.
Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong had both gone into seclusion one after the other, and both the main lineage and external branches of the family had made significant progress. The number of minor sect cultivators in the Yuan and Qing generation was few, but with the Xi and Yue generation, the minor sect cultivators, mainly from the first and second lineages, had begun to take charge of the spirit fields.
According to the Li Family's ancestral laws, most of the descendants of Li Mutian's illegitimate brothers had gradually transformed from minor sects into side branches due to the rarity of spiritual orifices, slowly fading from history.
With the restraint of offspring by the two major sects of the Xuan and Jing generation, Li Xuanling and Li Xuanfeng, it was not until the third generation that the minor sects of the four lineages in the Li Family began to flourish, led by the minor sects formed by the illegitimate sons of Li Xuanxuan and Li Yuanyun, who took over the power of the previous generation.
Of course, Li Xijun saw this as a favorable development. It prevented the emergence of hundreds of mortal elders of his father's generation, but brought the estranged minor sect closer to the center of power and thus resolved many conflicts.
"Young master."
An Siming, with a sword at his side, approached and cupped his fist respectfully.
Li Xijun, who had been in seclusion for a year and a half, suddenly noticed that An Siming's spirit and demeanor had changed. He seemed more hopeful in life and was more motivated. Li Xijun could not help but laugh at this observation and ask, "Have you taken a wife?"
An Siming was taken aback, shaking his head repeatedly before continuing, "You must be joking, young master! Young Master Xicheng is already waiting at the foot of the mountain."
Li Xijun descended gracefully to the foot of the mountain, where his elder brother, Li Xicheng, had been waiting for some time, clad in leather armor. He looked more mature now, seeming to be around twenty-six or twenty-seven years old.
Li Xicheng was also at the Qi Cultivation Realm, practicing the River One Qi Technique. He had married a woman from the Tian Family and taken concubines mostly from the An Family, so he had many children, most of whom were two or three years old.
As a father to so many children now, Li Xicheng had grown a beard and tied his hair, exuding a dignified presence. He greeted Li Xijun with a warm smile, saying, "It has been a long time, brother."
Li Xijun nodded slightly and landed beside him. A nearby horse snorted, eyeing him warily.
Li Xijun scanned the area with his spiritual sense, noting that the sides were filled with cultivators, primarily his illegitimate brothers and external branches of humble origins, all standing respectfully on either side.
As a youth, Li Xicheng had loved to protect his kin and befriend cultivators. Those who had benefited from his kindness now flocked around him.
Li Xicheng waved his broad hand, and the crowd dispersed right away. The two brothers strolled along the stone path, and Li Xicheng, in a warm tone, said with a smile, "This past year, while you and Ximing were in seclusion, there have been significant changes in the family. The family head has reformed the clan system; it is no longer as it was before."
He then recounted all the events of the past year and a half. Li Xijun frowned as he listened, and when Li Xicheng finally finished, he added, "Now, the changes have taken effect easily. Several immortal mountains have been restructured, and the construction of grand palaces is in full swing. All the cultivators are cooperating, contributing their money and effort..."
"They would naturally cooperate!"
Li Xijun thought it through quickly and understood the situation clearly. His expression darkened, and he said coldly, "The clan has given them power and stipends. They are not fools; of course they are pleased!"
Li Xijun spoke these words, but inwardly he pondered to himself, No wonder the spiritual qi on Mount Yuting has diminished significantly. It turns out that cultivators have entered the mountain! The family should start building a spirit-gathering formation so as not to delay the cultivation of the main lineage.
Li Xicheng quickly smiled, trying to smooth things over, "They are not taking it for free. The clan has assigned them various tasks, and now they are out there working—even bringing in some extra income for the family!"
Seeing that Li Xicheng still did not understand, Li Xijun looked around, saw no one nearby, and sighed as he spoke his thoughts.
"Brother, our elders have reluctantly divided their power. As juniors, we should feel ashamed, not proud..."
