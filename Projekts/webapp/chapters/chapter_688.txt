Since the Jiang Family split apart and fragmented into numerous smaller families, Moongaze Lake became a hidden source of profit for the Xiao Family. Although they did not demand tribute, the Xiao Family had controlled the various mines, spirit springs, and treasured lands on the eastern shore for over two hundred years.
Ultimately, in the eyes of the various families around the lake in earlier years, the Li Family was nothing more than a puppet propped up by the Xiao Family on the buffer zone of the southern shore. Following orders, the Li Family dismantled the Yu Family’s marketplace which led the Yu Family into gradual decline.
From a grand strategic perspective, Xiao Chuting merely played a single move, with minimal effort. Yet he managed to circumvent the ban on crossing domains beyond Azure Pond. He orchestrated the dramatic collapse of the Yu Family that was at its peak. It was a masterful stroke of calculation.
Now that the Li Family was expanding rapidly, they had become the dominant force on the lake. They showed ambitions of unifying the region. Naturally, this encroached upon the Xiao Family’s interests, making the Xiao Family’s stance all the more crucial.
Seeing Xiao Yuansi ask so directly, Li Xijun nodded slightly and replied softly, "The time is approaching. I intend to claim the Yu Family’s territory."
He mentioned only the Yu Family’s territory, signaling that he had no intention of interfering with the other families on the eastern shore. Upon hearing this, Xiao Yuansi did not say much but spoke softly, "Our sect’s Daoist Master recently met with Daoist Master Pu Yu of the Unison Sea’s Quhai Sect while receiving guests in the mountains. It is said that Daoist Master Yuanwu traveled to the Eastern Sea seeking medicine but was politely refused by Pu Yu. Yuanwu was quite displeased and left in a huff."
As soon as Xiao Yuansi said this, Li Xijun immediately understood. Xiao Yuansi continued saying, "Daoist Master Pu Yu’s divine abilities allow him to balance Yin and Yang and perceive life and death… His meaning was that Yuanwu’s six senses are collapsing internally, his essence dissipating externally and his consciousness growing dim. The dark radiance around him shows signs of sudden demise. It’s likely that he already has one foot in the underworld."
Upon hearing this, Li Ximing smiled slightly. Ju Wu, witnessing them discussing the life and death of a Daoist Master, was terrified. He kept his head lowered. Then, Li Ximing asked, "Was Daoist Master Yuanwu seeking an elixir of longevity? He seems to be only in the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm… Surely, he’s not attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm?"
Xiao Yuansi replied softly, "He sought a Purple Mansion Lotus Water's Tranquil Origin for a body-snatching ritual. However, his divine arts have no connection to this path, it is an endeavor doomed to certain death. Daoist Master Pu Yu is a grandmaster in this field, how could he not see through it? Naturally, he refused to let him misuse it."
After finishing this explanation, he then added, "I must also take Ju Wu with me for further questioning. And Guiluan… did she fail her breakthrough and pass away in meditation?"
Li Xijun silently nodded. Xiao Yuansi had personally escorted the girl here for marriage back then. He couldn't help but sigh and said, "Upon hearing this, Guitu was deeply sorrowful. However, he has sealed the mountain and is not allowed to leave. He entrusted me to ask on his behalf, as a token of his condolences.
"Although Mount Wu is a place for witchcraft cultivation, its spiritual energy is quite extraordinary and could be put to great use. Once your esteemed family has cleared the dense forests, send a letter, and our family will surely come to offer our congratulations."
Xiao Yuansi said no more, cupping his hands lightly before grabbing the wailing and pleading Ju Wu. The two brothers escorted him out of the territory, then rode the wind back. Li Ximing remarked, "So Master’s stance is that the Xiao Family supports our family’s annexation of this land. The grand momentum is already in place."
Li Xijun responded softly, "Whether they support it or not, our family is set on taking Moongaze Lake. Given our ties, it’s only natural to turn this small benefit into goodwill."
Li Ximing nodded, glancing at the surrounding landscape before he said with a sigh, "The spiritual energy here is dense, there isn’t a single mountain in our family’s domain that can compare. Moving here for cultivation would be ideal."
Li Xijun only took a brief look before replying softly, "Among the lands of Mount Yue, only Huo Luo'e remains unyielding. We should press forward in one go and bring him under our governance."
The two soared on the wind. Li Xijun turned to Kongheng, who had remained silent the entire time, and asked, "Master Monk, who exactly is this Daoist Master Pu Yu?"
Kongheng pressed his hands together slightly and answered, "The overseas realms are vast, and the expanses of water are even greater than the mainland. Various sects exist, some hidden and some known. I have only heard that the Quhai Sect resides in Penglai, a sacred land that appears and disappears at times."
After some brief discussion, they soon arrived at Huo Luo'e’s territory. This was the southernmost area, it was close to Mount Dali. The region was sparsely populated and it appeared desolate.
Huo Luo'e had little presence among the Mount Yue regions. It was said that he was a reclusive cultivator with a taciturn nature, rarely interacting with others. Even his cultivation site was an openly accessible immortal mountain with weak protective formations.
He kept his mountain gates open and allowed anyone from Mount Yue with a spiritual orifice to enter and cultivate as they wished. He allowed them to learn as much or as little as they pleased. As a result, the mountain became widely occupied by various individuals, including some from the Li Family. Thus, the three of them traveled south and quickly arrived.
Li Xijun had already inquired about Huo Luo'e and developed an interest in recruiting him. Adopting a courteous approach before resorting to force, he called out in a powerful voice, "Li Xijun of the Qingdu Li family has come to pay a visit. Senior, please open the formation!"
After a few seconds, a figure rose on the wind. He was only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, appearing as a young man. He had a calm and respectful demeanor, his posture steady. He spoke politely. "I am Duan Duan. My master left for distant travels several months ago and left a message for me to convey."
He bowed his head deeply in utmost reverence and continued, "Huo Luo'e has occupied this sacred land for cultivation, offending many. Today, he follows the current eastward, heading to the Eastern Sea, never to return. All the spiritual items and talents he has gathered over forty years are left in Huo Luo Mountain, free for you to take."
Huo Luo'e ran away!
The two brothers exchanged glances, showing little surprise. Huo Luo'e either refused to join their sect or simply did not trust them. For him, avoiding a meeting altogether was the best option.
Descending into the mountain, they found that all the disciples had already opened the gates and surrendered. They were kneeling neatly in formation. There were only a few at the Qi Cultivation Realm and dozens at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. All of them looked well-trained. Dressed in eastern attire, they bowed their heads in submission and displayed no Mount Yue customs.
Li Xijun turned to look down at the Mount Yue lands beneath his feet, silently contemplating, The northern Mount Yue territories have all fallen into our hands. The entire southern shore of Moongaze Lake… now bears the Li name.
