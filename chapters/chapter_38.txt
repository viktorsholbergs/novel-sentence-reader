“I secretly assessed your root bone a few months back.” Li Xiangping paused, he turned to face Li Xuanxuan, whose eyes were wide with anticipation, and continued, “There’s no spiritual orifice in your Qihai.”
For Li Xuanxuan, these words shocked him like lightning from a clear sky. His mind reeled and a wave of sadness flooded his heart. His eyes reddened and he pressed his lips firmly in a struggle to accept this harsh reality.
His understanding of spirit orifices was limited. All he knew was that the number of immortal cultivators in their entire village could be counted on one hand.
Among them were the two uncles in his family and even Li Qiuyang, a lesser talented member from the side family, was blessed with a spiritual orifice. In light of this, he had always assumed that he, too, would naturally have at least a spiritual orifice even if he lacked innate talent.
Upon hearing that he lacked any spiritual orifice and was destined to remain a mere mortal for life, a wave of gloom enveloped Li Xuanxuan’s heart and unshed tears slowly filled his eyes.
“This mirror here is a treasure I found as a child while fishing in the river,” Li Xiangping said, gesturing to the bluish-gray object on the stone platform,
He gently patted Li Xuanxuan’s head with a smile and asked, “Do you know its special power?”
Li Xuanxuan, fighting back tears, replied earnestly, “I don’t.”
“It grants those without spiritual orifice the ability to cultivate.”
Upon hearing this, Li Xuanxuan’s despair momentarily ceased. He fixed his gaze on Li Xiangping’s face as a flicker of hope ignited within him.
He broke into a tearful smile and said, “Are you teasing me, Third Uncle?”
Seeing Li Xiangping’s smiling face, a realization dawned on him. He shivered and gasped, “Could it be that…”
“Yes,” Li Xiangping confirmed solemnly.
"Your father, your second and third uncles, even your fourth uncle, Li Chejing, who is cultivating at the immortal sect… None of us possesses a spiritual orifice. The rise of our Li Family is entirely thanks to this mirror. Without it, we’d be mere farming peasants.”
The gravity of this revelation left Li Xuanxuan speechless, his world spinning as he whispered in disbelief, “This mirror picked up from the river transformed my family from mortals to immortals?”
“Yes! This mirror can refine moonlight into the Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds. It’s miraculous but dangerous. If word gets out, our family could be destroyed!” Li Xiangping warned. He paused for a moment upon seeing Li Xuanxuan’s astonished expression.
Meanwhile, Li Xuanxuan murmured to himself, piecing together the puzzle.
“So that’s it! Now it all makes sense! No wonder Grandpa refuses to speak about his cultivation whenever I ask. So my three uncles have spiritual orifices not because of Grandpa’s achievements but this treasure!
“Third Uncle kept Li Qiuyang away from me in order to conceal the fact that I lack a spiritual orifice. When the Liu Family secretly climbed the mountain and was killed by my family, it wasn’t out of cruelty. Third Uncle was only acting out of fear…”
The realization sent a shiver down Li Xuanxuan’s spine. With sweat beading on his forehead, he respectfully cupped his fist to Li Xiangping and said, “Everyone seems to have misunderstood Third Uncle and thought that he is fierce and wary! With such a treasure in the Li Family, caution is necessary.”
Li Xiangping was struck by the boy’s comment. Looking at Li Xuanxuan, he could not help but think that the child before him seemed to have grown beyond his years.
He gently asked, “Do you know why I told Li Qiuyang that you’re close to condensing the Profound Scenery Chakra?”
Li Xuanxuan thought deeply for a moment, then responded, “My guess is that this mirror can greatly speed up cultivation progress. Third Uncle probably said that to prevent Li Qiuyang from raising suspicions, making it seem as if I had already started cultivating months ago.”
“Good!” Li Xiangping commended, patting Li Xuanxuan’s shoulder approvingly. “You’re truly a child of the Li Family. You’ve learned much from your grandfather!”
He then knelt before the stone platform, tapped a spot gently, and retrieved a wooden slip from its side.
Handing it to Li Xuanxuan and watching him accept the item respectfully, he explained, “This contains the “Reception Method”. It’s key to acquiring the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed. Study it well here over the next month. On the winter solstice, you’ll be ready to receive the talisman seed. You’ll stay in the adjacent room, and I’ll make sure someone brings you your meals.”
“Yes,” Li Xuanxuan nodded with conviction, his gaze intently fixed on the wooden slip. As Li Xiangping closed the door and his footsteps receded into silence, Li Xuanxuan bowed his head, deeply engrossed in the text before him.
…Father is in good health, and Second Brother has successfully condensed the Celestial Whirl Chakra. Enclosed within this letter are three Snake Essence Pills. I hope Jing’er will diligently cultivate and soon progress to the Qi Cultivation Realm. Everyone at home is well. There’s no need for concern!
Li Chejing carefully put away the letter, wiping away tears from his eyes. He carefully placed the three bottles of Snake Essence Pills on a shelf, then turned to Xiao Yuansi.
“Thank you, Senior Brother. Your kindness to our family is deeply appreciated. I’m truly grateful,” he expressed his gratitude.
“There’s no need for such formalities,” Xiao Yuan Si replied, shaking his head. “We’re more than senior brothers in the same sect; we’re a family. You don’t have to be so polite.”
Li Chejing nodded solemnly, then shared, “With these Snake Essence Pills and the Bright Spirit Powder from Master, I’m quite certain I’ll be able to condense the Jade Capital Chakra.”
After a moment of reflection, he inquired softly, “Master mentioned that during the transition from the Embryonic Breathing Realm to the Qi Cultivation Realm, one must first swallow the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth. Could you enlighten me on the specifics?”
Xiao Yuansi took a sip of tea, moistening his throat before explaining, “In the process of refining qi, one must first inhale a breath of Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth.
“This spiritual qi could manifest in various forms—the Minor Pure Spiritual Qi from refining the spiritual qi among the mountains, or by converting the baleful qi from earth veins into Earth Vein Baleful Qi, or even capturing morning mist and refining it into Dawn Colored Qi…”
“The key is to ensure that this qi aligns with your cultivation method to ensure purity and potency, laying a strong foundation for building mana. Most of the rogue cultivators opt for the Minor Pure Spiritual Qi refined from spiritual qi among the mountains as it’s compatible with various cultivation methods, and it’s neither too intense nor too mild.”
“Oh?” Li Chejing’s interest was immediately piqued by Xiao Yuansi’s explanation.
Eager for more information, he quickly asked, “What type of Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth would be most suitable for my family’s qi cultivation technique?”
“While I’m not familiar with your family’s specific cultivation method, judging by the clarity and brightness of your mana, there are several techniques within our sect that would suit you well.”
Xiao Yuansi set down his teacup, smiling as he noticed Li Chejing’s eager expression, and elaborated, “One such technique is the Clear Essence Rain Control Technique, a renowned technique in our Azure Pond Sect. It harnesses the qi found in the mist of rain, specifically refined from the rain and mist of the spirit mountain. It excels in maneuvering clouds and mist, using softness to overcome adversaries.
“Another is the Yin Mountain Forest Mist Technique. This method draws upon the Yin qi found in mountainous regions, but not many of our sect members chose to use this.
“The third, and most challenging, is the Moon Lake Autumn Reflection Technique. Since the third peak master of Moon Lake Peak mastered it, no one else has succeeded. Perhaps there are some tricks behind it, but that master passed over three hundred years ago, leaving no clues behind…”
Upon hearing the mention of a technique related to the moon, Li Chejing’s heart surged with excitement.
However, his enthusiasm waned when Xiao Yuansi mentioned its difficulty, prompting him to ask anxiously, “Why has no one else succeeded?”
