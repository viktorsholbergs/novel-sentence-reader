The big black ox stood up, its hooves kicked fiercely at the man’s back, and the sound of bones cracking resounded.
**_Bang!_**
Terrified, The man spat out a mouthful of blood as his body tilted forward, barely able to maintain his balance.
Chen Xun remained incredibly calm, his adrenaline surging. He drew out the Mountain-Opening axe from his waist and swung it fiercely at the man's neck.
The immense force buried the weapon deep into the man’s neck, almost to the bone. Chen Xun's face was sprayed with blood as he continued to pant heavily.
"Old ox, do your job." Chen Xun's pupils trembled slightly as he took out a flint; the forest was full of dry branches.
Not daring to waste any time, the big black ox began to dig a pit nearby.
They didn’t dare take anything on the man’s person. The corpse was set ablaze, burning away all the evidence as ashes scattered. Both man and ox quickly destroyed any traces left behind. They then ran off with accelerating pace. Chen Xun swore that in his entire life, he had never ran this fast. The big black ox was even faster than him.
…
Two hours later, several people arrived at the spot where the fight took place, all frowning.
"Master, Liu Tian stopped here at that time."
"Why?"
"There was a young man leading a big black ox. It seems that Brother Liu wanted to buy his animal to supplement the new disciples' nutrition."
"Hmm."
The master stood on a tree branch with hands behind his back, observing the ground, "There are signs of burning. And the footprints are chaotic, making it hard to determine the direction he headed in."
"Master, could Brother Liu have been attacked?"
The man was startled; Liu was a strong member of the Bai Xuan Sect, and if something had happened, it ought to have caused some waves.
"The attacker was very cautious and left few traces, but the young man is the key." Frowning, he asked, "Does anyone remember his appearance?"
"Reporting to master... no one remembers," The man bowed his head and replied. Who would bother remembering the face of a cowherd, especially when on a mission?
"Worthless bunch."
"Master, please calm down."
The others also bowed their heads and said, "Liu's death is indeed suspicious."
"Let’s get moving. There's not much to find here. Take care of his family. Without seeing the body, we can't be sure if he's dead."
The master sighed softly. Although there were signs of burning on the ground, he couldn't believe that someone had managed to kill him and burn his body in such a short time.
"Yes, master." They took light steps and swiftly disappeared, flitting through the trees like swallows in the sky.
….
Chen Xun lay flat in the water of some river, washing away the bloodstains from his body. He gazed at the sky, lost in thought.
The big black ox was playing in the water nearby and suddenly splashed some on Chen Xun's face, snapping him back to reality.
"Old ox, you did well today. Remember, when dealing with shady characters, there’s no need for any foolish hesitation," Chen Xun said coldly. The man was no saint; a killer should be prepared to get killed. "We won't provoke anyone, but if anyone shows the slightest murderous intent towards us, we'll be sure to make him regret it!"
"Moo! Moo!"
Mooing, the big black ox snorted fiercely. Anyone who dared to harm Chen Xun would face its deadly kicks.
By the riverbank, he burned the clothes he had been wearing and changed into new ones before spending the night there.
The night passed without incident. And they continued their journey, heading towards a large city where it was said that many cultivators resided, making it much safer than the wilderness.
...
In the distance lay a sprawling giant city, bordering it were grand walls extending high into the sky. Through its countless years of existence, it had accumulated a long and rich history. With its gates having watched people come and go through the years, like some ancient ferocious beast. And even to this day, the entrance to the city would still be noisy, bustling with people as they went to and fro; this was Panning City.
Fighting was strictly prohibited inside, and as such, its orderly and civil nature had led it to become a highly prosperous metropolis. Furthermore, being backed by the vast Ningyun Mountain Range meant that the city's inhabitants would often venture into the mountains, collecting spirit herbs and selling them to cultivators.
The Ningyun Mountain Range was immensely expansive, seemingly endless. It was rumored that there were even immortal sects hidden deep within its misty domain, concealed from the mortal world.
"Wow, it's my first time seeing such a majestic city wall," Chen Xun exclaimed, looking at the somewhat weathered giant city from afar. A smile appeared on his face as he said, "Old ox, our new life is about to begin."
"Moo!"
The big black ox mooed cheerily, dancing. It was amazed by the sheer size of the city wall, which dwarfed the few fences they had encountered in the village.
"In this vast world, we'll travel through mountains and seas, and experience everything it has to offer. This is the true meaning of longevity," Chen Xun said with great anticipation. "Old ox, charge!"
"Moo!"
The two of them ran forward, raising clouds of dust as they went. Chen Xun laughed heartily while holding the ox's rope, and the animal continued to moo.
The people on the roadside shook their heads and smiled, feeling envious of their youthful excitement.
The entrance to Panning City was enormous, with numerous carriages and people with cattle and sheep going in and out without any signs of congestion.
Chen Xun was filled with amazement, looking around in all directions. Everyone who glanced at him received a smile in response, leaving them with a good impression.
He observed the soldiers guarding the city gate with curiosity. It was his first time seeing ancient soldiers, and indeed, they did not disappoint; exuding a strong and vigorous aura.
One of the city guards furrowed his brow as he noticed a young man seemingly sizing them up. Before he could approach him, the young man unexpectedly raised his thumb, giving an affirmative look. The guard was taken aback, then, he stopped and smiled, nodding in acknowledgment. "So that’s what that was…?"
As they went beyond the city gates, both Chen Xun and the black ox froze in their tracks, a magnificent scene unfolding right before their eyes.
The streets were remarkably broad and were filled with countless street vendors hawking their goods. Street performers showcased their skills, drawing enthusiastic crowds who generously tossed copper coins in encouragement.
The pedestrians walked by, dressed in silk, emanating charm with every gesture as they displayed their magnificence.
And when they looked upwards, they saw numerous pavilions and towers adorned with lanterns.
Scholars engaged in duels of poetry, and beauties accompanied them as they listened, or recited their own pieces which they have come to adore. Their beautiful visage enraptured the mind.
The duo were left mesmerized. "Wonderful!"
Chen Xun and the ox decided to stand on the periphery near the acrobats and enjoyed the show, contributing to the atmosphere. But suddenly, struggle appeared in Chen Xun’s eyes. "We can’t just stand here freeloading," he thought.
He searched around his waist for a second before throwing a copper coin into the gong. The performer heard the sound and immediately turned towards Chen Xun, breathing out flames, and making the performance even more spectacular.
"Great!" Chen Xun exclaimed happily, clapping his hands.
The black ox was surprised. Judging by the person’s performance, it thought that they must have been a cultivator to perform such tricks for them. It was truly a sight worthy of a big city.
After watching for a while, they stepped out of the crowd and bought two sticks of sugar-coated haws. Both Chen Xun and the ox took a big bite, causing the passing young ladies to giggle.
"These are really exquisite crafts," Chen Xun said, his eyes wide open, looking at the vendors on the roadside.
Everything was handmade. These people depended on this craft to make a living, so they couldn't afford to be dishonest.
"Young man, see anything you like?" The vendor greeted them kindly.
"I'm just looking. I'll definitely buy something when I have money in the future," Chen Xun replied, feeling a little embarrassed but sincere in his words.
"No problem. I have a damaged wooden carving here. If you like it, take it," the vendor said, taking out a lifelike tiger statue, only, its tail was broken.
"Boss, let's exchange. I have some rice here, and I really like this carving," Chen Xun proposed.
"Deal!" The vendor handed the carving to Chen Xun, who, in turn, gave him some rice.
Back on the street, Chen Xun held the carving with both hands, unwilling to part with it. The big black ox watched in envy and wondered why the vendor didn't give it one as well.
