"Dividing off the eastern mountainous region, offering treasures from the southern border to the old flood dragon, and keeping the Purple Smoke Gate in the north allied and relatively quiet, while being cut off by Xiao Chuting to the west..." Chi Zhiyun muttered as he sat silently on the radiant throne, holding his forehead in distress.
He felt deeply uneasy, only now realizing what Chi Wei had meant. At this point, the Azure Pond Sect was like a volcano on the verge of erupting.
No sooner had Chi Wei died than the Xiao Family declared themselves an immortal clan. Several other immortal sects had continually tested the waters, and families across various prefectures had grown restless. If not for the four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators holding the fort, things would have already gone awry.
Now, the only option is to appease and keep the Xiao Family neutral, while firmly suppressing the families. As long as there are four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators within the sect, nothing too drastic will happen…
Chi Zhiyun thought of how the Xiao Family had produced four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators overnight and ground his teeth in fury. He struck the armrest heavily and cursed out loud.
"What an annoying clan!"
While he remained deep in thought, a person approached and reported respectfully, "Sect Master, Linghai Prefecture has been in turmoil… A group of devil cultivators incited rogue cultivators to attack the market established by our Azure Pond Sect. Fortunately, several peak masters arrived in time to disperse the crowd and capture a few impoverished rogues."
Chi Zhiyun raised his head in disbelief, asking in a stern voice, "How could this happen? How dare these rogue cultivators assault our immortal sect's market?!"
The man hesitated for a moment before replying, "According to the peak masters, it seems these people have been bewitched by devil techniques and acted in madness. This is no trivial matter!"
"Devil techniques..?"
Chi Zhiyun froze for a moment. In ancient times, people would always say devils should be killed on sight. Nowadays, few distinguished between immortals and devils. If anything, it was most likely a curse spell.
"Don't worry about them for now," he said with a dismissive wave of his hand.
The man cupped his fist in acknowledgment before continuing, "Si Yuanbai has left the tower, gathered his belongings from the Azure Pond Peak, and left without speaking to the Daoist Master. He headed out on his own."
Chi Zhiyun chuckled and nodded.
"Let him do whatever he wants."
Li Tongya bid farewell to the fox and continued heading east with the wind, landing at the market on Cloud Crowned Peak. Now that Xiao Chuting had attained the Purple Mansion Realm, the market felt different, frequently hosting cultivators who arrived specifically to discuss the Xiao Family.
Li Tongya found a spirit medicine store. Inside, a Qi Cultivation Realm apprentice was counting medicinal ingredients behind the counter. Spotting Li Tongya, he immediately stood up and walked over with a welcoming smile.
"Old Master, are you here to purchase some herbs?"
"Yes, good medicine," Li Tongya replied with a nod.
The apprentice was momentarily stunned before dropping to his knees.
"Might you be a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator..?" he asked nervously, head bowed.
"Yes," Li Tongya answered softly.
With that confirmation, the apprentice fell prostrate, bowing repeatedly and struggling to speak.
"I… I apologize for my lack of manners! Please follow me upstairs, Senior…" he stammered.
Li Tongya was at a loss for words, surprised by the reverence given to Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. He wanted to speak but remained silent when he noticed the apprentice trembling, simply ascending the stairs without another word.
The second floor was furnished much more lavishly, with several Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators busy browsing the counters for ingredients.
As Li Tongya walked through the door, all eyes turned toward him instantly. The moment their spiritual senses came in contact with his aura, they quickly withdrew it in shock and greeted him respectfully.
"Greetings, Senior!"
"Greetings, Ancestor!"
Seeing how cautious the Qi Cultivators were, and sensing the sudden hush in the shop, Li Tongya waved his hand somewhat awkwardly.
"Continue as you were… I'm only here to find some ingredients."
"Understood!"
The cultivators awkwardly resumed their browsing but exchanged uncertain glances with each other, eventually leaving one by one until the entire shop was empty—except for Li Tongya.
The shopkeeper, though business was disrupted, plastered on an ingratiating smile and said respectfully, "What would you like, Senior?"
"Do you have any spirit medicine?" Li Tongya asked.
The shopkeeper frowned slightly at this, and he stammered, "Selling spirit medicine is forbidden under the orders of the Azure Pond Sect… Only the immortal sect itself can handle such transactions."
Li Tongya paused and reflected on the earlier presence of Qi Cultivators, a suspicion forming in his mind. He murmured quietly, "It seems this market is no longer of use to Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators…"
The shopkeeper responded respectfully, "Senior, Cloud Crowned Peak Market provides spirit items and dharma artifacts mainly for the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm. It is rare for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to visit here. However, you may find useful information from the nearby clans… Some of them might have what you are looking for."
He continued, "Only a few markets in Yue State have spirit items and artifacts suitable for those of the Foundation Establishment Realm. In the past, the Moongaze Lake Market attracted many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Unfortunately, it is no longer active."
Seeing Li Tongya deep in thought, the shopkeeper offered an obsequious smile and continued, "You should ask around… The immortal clans on the peak, the Yuan Family at Mushroom Forest Plain, and the Yu and Fei families at Moongaze Lake might know where to find the spirit medicine you're looking for."
Li Tongya nodded, though he couldn't help but inwardly chuckle to himself.
Buying spirit medicine from the Xiao Family just to give it back as a gift is quite absurd!
Observing Li Tongya's expression, the shopkeeper asked carefully, "Senior, may I inquire which family you are an ancestor of, or which peak you cultivate at? I can gather information for you and bring any updates if there come any."
Raising an eyebrow, Li Tongya realized that this shopkeeper was smart and bold indeed, trying to find a powerful patron. However, he couldn't reveal his identity, as only close allies and immediate family knew of his recent breakthrough. Moreover, it wasn't time to intervene in this market yet. He waved it off dismissively.
"I am just a rogue cultivator."
The shopkeeper wiped the sweat from his forehead and apologized profusely. Li Tongya didn't mind this and, noting the shopkeeper's shrewdness, left him an open-ended command.
"Keep your ears open… I will return in a few years."
The shopkeeper brightened at this and nodded repeatedly as Li Tongya ascended on the wind, vanishing above the market. Finally, wiping his brow, the shopkeeper murmured, "With a Foundation Establishment Realm clan supporting us, we could move closer to the market center and avoid being pushed around."
His apprentice stepped forward and whispered, "How can you be sure? What if he is really just a rogue cultivator? Would we not be inviting trouble?"
With a sly grin, the shopkeeper replied, "The senior was seeking spirit medicine directly and openly, which are not something rogue cultivators can easily afford. His aura was commanding, indicating high status… Even at worst, he would at least have a small temple. I see you still have much to learn!"
"Yes!" the apprentice acknowledged. The staff, now cheerful, resumed organizing their herbs with renewed energy.
