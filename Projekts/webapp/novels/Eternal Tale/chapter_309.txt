"Eh?"
A flicker of interest flashed through Chen Xun's eyes as he spotted a familiar figure. "Old Ox, look over at the edge."
"Moo?" The big black ox followed his gaze and suddenly jolted in surprise. "Moo!"
At that moment, on the outskirts of the military camp, a young man suddenly felt two gazes on him. He snapped his eyes open and swiftly turned around.
But the moment he saw the man and the ox, his entire body tensed up like a stone. His heart plummeted as if it had been filled with cold lead.
The young man's face turned deathly pale in an instant. He sat frozen in place, feeling cold sweat trickle down his back.
W-what… What’s going on? How could it be them again?!
His heartbeat pounded wildly. There was no way; this was just a coincidence. This was The Great Li Realm, not Qian Nation—what were the chances of running into them here?!
And this was the territory of the hidden noble clan, the Baili family. There was no way they'd allow outsiders to wander freely.
This man was none other than Meng Sheng, whom Chen Xun had encountered twice before in that small cultivation sect. Now, Meng Sheng had advanced to the Nascent Soul early stage—a testament to his incredible fortune.
When Chen Xun had left Qian Nation, Meng Sheng had been in seclusion and hadn’t come to see him off. He didn’t even know it was Chen Xun who had departed—only that it was the strongest cultivator in Qian Nation’s cultivation world.
"Heh, young man, it's you," Chen Xun said with a warm smile, sending a voice transmission without disturbing the other cultivators in training. "Come over and have a chat. It's been a while since I've run into someone familiar."
"Senior…" Meng Sheng smiled bitterly. He let out a long breath, got up slowly, and stole a glance at the towering, black-armored man leading the training at the front.
That powerful cultivator nodded slightly at Meng Sheng, acknowledging that the man outside was a guest of the Baili clan.
Meng Sheng took a deep breath, feeling as if a dark cloud had settled over his head. No matter how much he improved, this senior’s cultivation always seemed far beyond his reach.
Before long…
They were strolling along the mountain paths, surrounded by spiritual beasts that moved freely without fear of humans.
Meng Sheng followed half a step behind Chen Xun, looking visibly uneasy. Two spiritual beasts beside him stared at him curiously, their cultivation levels both above his own.
He had fought his way through the treacherous world of cultivation, rising step by step to the Nascent Soul stage, experiencing countless dangers along the way.
His Dao heart was as firm as a boulder. But in the face of that single word—"young man"—his composure completely collapsed.
Meng Sheng steeled himself, already preparing his responses. The Baili family might not know his past, but this senior knew everything—he had seen him back in his Qi Refining days!
"How are you adjusting to life in The Great Li Realm?"
"Senior?"
Meng Sheng was momentarily caught off guard by the casual question but quickly composed himself. "It's… alright. The Baili family doesn’t have much scheming and infighting."
Chen Xun chuckled at Meng Sheng's flustered expression. "No need to be so nervous. We aren’t interested in the fortunes of a junior like you."
"Understood!" Meng Sheng halted his steps and gave a deep bow. "This encounter was too sudden—I have been discourteous."
If this senior truly had any ill intentions, there was no way he could escape. He might as well stay calm and see what Chen Xun wanted.
His lips pressed together as his aura shifted—his demeanor now steadier, exuding the same disciplined air as the Baili clan's warriors.
"Old Ox, this kid does seem different from before."
Chen Xun glanced at the big black ox with some nostalgia, then turned back to Meng Sheng. "Making it out of Qian Nation must not have been easy, huh?"
"Indeed, senior," Meng Sheng responded respectfully, an odd feeling rising in his heart. "But I’ve grown used to it."
They continued walking at a leisurely pace. Little Red remained curious; he had never even heard of a place called Qian Nation.
"Mo~" The big black ox occasionally chewed on patches of grass, treating them like snacks.
"Meng Sheng, how’s the cultivation world in Qian Nation these days?"
"Reporting to senior—it is quite peaceful. I was forced to leave from the Northern Territory…"
"Oh? Someone was after you?"
"While exploring a secret realm in the south, I made enemies with some powerful cultivators and was hunted to the Northern Territory. That’s when I discovered an ancient teleportation array…"
Meng Sheng’s gaze grew sharp as he walked beside Chen Xun. “After being transported to the edge of the Ten Thousand Mountains, I was captured immediately…”
“Hahaha…”
Chen Xun burst into laughter and even patted Meng Sheng on the shoulder. “But your luck wasn’t too bad. The Baili clan is reasonable—not your average cultivators.”
“Moo moo~” The big black ox laughed as well. It seemed this young human had an exceptionally rough cultivation journey.
Little Red snickered on the side, a mischievous glint in his eyes. This was what happened when you ran around recklessly without a plan—sticking with Brother Xun was the safer bet.
Meng Sheng’s face was full of embarrassment, being openly laughed at by three seniors. Yet, oddly enough, he found himself enjoying the atmosphere.
Chen Xun sized Meng Sheng up. His face, once full of youthful vigor, was now weathered by time and hardship.
“Meng Sheng, do you know where that teleportation array is? We might need to borrow it to return to Qian Nation.”
His tone was warm and reassuring, like a spring breeze. “If it’s inconvenient, there’s no need to force it. We can always take a flying boat back.”
“Senior, you flatter me too much.”
Meng Sheng’s expression shifted, and he quickly retrieved a titanium-white token from his storage ring. “This is the restriction token for the large teleportation array. Activating it will allow you to return.”
The token’s intricate inscriptions were complex, with faint ancient script—clearly an old relic.
The big black ox’s interest was piqued. It immediately stepped forward and examined the token with its divine sense. “Moo? Moo moo moo!”
Chen Xun nodded at the ox’s findings and smiled at Meng Sheng. “It seems this token won’t last for too many transmissions. The teleportation array must be unstable.”
“Yes, Senior. The materials for the ancient teleportation array couldn’t be fully gathered in Qian Nation. I only managed a partial repair.”
Meng Sheng carefully glanced at the big black ox—this spiritual beast had a deep understanding of formations. “However, the Baili clan’s teleportation array on this end is in perfect condition.”
The big black ox gave a small nod. Large teleportation arrays didn’t actually require tokens to activate; this token was merely a restriction key to stabilize the array.
With incomplete materials, the teleportation would naturally be unstable—risking spatial storms or directional misalignment. But with this token, some of those dangers could be mitigated.
“Alright, we’ll hold onto it for now and return it to you once we’re back.”
“Se—”
“No need. Take these as an exchange.”
Chen Xun cut him off directly and pulled out several items from his storage ring. “This is a bottle of superior-grade Supreme Purity Ancient Pills. They contain no pill toxins and are highly beneficial for Nascent Soul cultivators.”
Meng Sheng’s eyes widened slightly. Pill toxins… free of them? He had never even heard of such a thing.
Moreover, he had intended to give the token to Chen Xun as a gesture of goodwill, never expecting anything in return.
“Young man, do you practice alchemy?”
“Reporting to Senior—I do.”
“Then take this booklet. It contains some of my personal insights, written casually back in the day. It might be a bit disorganized, haha, but consider it a reference.”
Chen Xun handed over a white booklet, well-preserved with spiritual energy. A casually placed orange rested on top of it. “This orange is quite good—give it a taste.”
Meng Sheng accepted it with both hands, his heart filled with deep shock. The scene before him completely reshaped his understanding of the cultivation world.
“Old Ox, Little Red, let’s go.”
With one hand behind his back, Chen Xun walked toward the depths of the mountains. Their three figures gradually faded into the mist, leaving Meng Sheng standing there, still dazed.
Suddenly, he snapped back to his senses and looked toward the distant figures, gathering his courage as he called out, “Senior, may I ask your name?”
“In the Dao, we all strive forward, and though a thousand miles apart, the same wind carries us. Young man, I am Chen Xun.”
A hearty laugh echoed from the distance, blending with the mountain breeze. Exotic flowers and spiritual herbs fluttered in the air. The figure ahead raised a hand in farewell before vanishing into the forest.
Meng Sheng’s eyes were filled with deep respect. He remained silent for a long time before bowing deeply.
That silhouette would forever remain in his heart.
