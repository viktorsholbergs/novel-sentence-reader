In a small town, sandstorms were rampant, with debris blowing around and creating a constant howling sound.
The two culprits were standing by a street vendor eating noodles, occasionally getting sand in their mouths as they communicated telepathically.
"Old ox, I've compared the three alchemy recipes. There's no problem." Chen Xun's eyes were filled with determination as he took a big bite of noodles. "The next step is to gather the spiritual herbs."
"Moo~~" The big black ox was also eating on the ground, drawing curious looks from the vendor behind them, but the young man was indeed generous.
"Moo?"
The big black ox slowly lifted its head to look at Chen Xun. Except for the Jade Source Fruit, it had never seen the other herbs, only heard of them.
When they robbed the two sect masters, they also subtly inquired about the herbs. They were widely distributed and required special environments, none of which were found in Anyun Nation.
Their sect didn't have anyone who had cultivated the Water Spirit Technique to the third level, and in the Eastern countries, there were even cultivators who established sects to guard these spiritual herbs.
"But what is this 'Five Qi Ink Spirit Flower'?" Chen Xun looked at the big black ox in confusion. He had never heard of it. "Old ox, do you know?"
"Moo~" The big black ox thought for a moment and shook its head. It had never heard of it either, probably some spiritual herb used during the Nascent Soul stage.
"Damn." Chen Xun suddenly lost his appetite for the noodles in his hand.
His expression was uncertain. Not only this flower, but he also had no idea how to obtain the other dozen spiritual herbs, which were quite rare.
Moreover, their understanding of the sects and environments in the Eastern countries was still limited. It wouldn't be figured out in a day or two.
"Moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, telling him not to worry.
"Old ox, I'm not in a hurry, just thinking of a way." Chen Xun chuckled and started eating again. "We'll probably have to start with the major sects, but to get information, we need to focus on the three major forces."
"Moo~~" The big black ox's eyes were filled with wisdom. It had an idea and wrote a few words on the ground: Spirit Herb Garden.
"Old ox, that's a bit smart, but not much."
"Moo?"
"How could such rare items be casually planted in a Spirit Herb Garden? They must be carried around or kept near their caves." Chen Xun pondered. "However, if spiritual herbs need to increase their age, they must be nurtured in their original environment. If not, they have to be nurtured with the Water Spirit Technique. Not all Nascent Soul elders have the third level of the Water Spirit Technique, right?"
"Moo!"
"But we don't completely understand the distribution and structure of these three major forces. We need to plan long-term." Chen Xun nodded slightly and exchanged a glance with the big black ox, both showing a look of wisdom. "Maybe they left a few Nascent Soul elders to guard them. We need to learn more."
"Moo~" The ox nodded. That was certain. No one was foolish.
"We're not in a hurry. Let's not act like we have Nascent Soul enemies chasing us." Chen Xun laughed heartily. "We have no attachments in Qian Nation. It's perfect to hang around here."
"Moo moo!" The big black ox laughed, recalling the days when he was chased by a big yellow dog.
"Let's go, Old ox." Chen Xun drank some soup and shouted to the back, "Boss, we're leaving."
"Moo~" The big black ox also licked its lips.
"Okay, take care!" The boss came out with a smile. The man and ox duo both had a huge appetite, which made him a lot of money.
They covered their faces with scarves and gradually disappeared into the sandstorm, leaving Anyun Nation.
...
In the following days, Chen Xun and the big black ox wandered like travelers, gathering information across various countries. They witnessed small countries rise, flourish, and fall in the course of time, with large numbers of people displaced and constantly fleeing.
Chen Xun and the big black ox sometimes got caught in the chaos, just having noodles by the roadside. Then, shouts would come from the other end, saying that a large army had invaded the city, and they would run along with the fleeing people.
They also helped these people escape, killing many monsters or bandits to reduce casualties along the way. However, due to the sharp decline in the number of cultivators, many small countries have become more chaotic. The ambitions of mundane rulers were even greater than those of cultivators! An emperor's rage could result in millions of corpses and rivers of blood.
Sometimes, Chen Xun and the big black ox would sit atop a mountain, feeling a lump in their throats, and continually record their observations in a small booklet.
Having lived peacefully in the Qian Nation for so long, it wasn't until they ventured out that they realized how naive their thoughts had been.
Chen Xun no longer complained or blamed others. He realized that human nature was unpredictable, and the way of heaven was heartless, merely conforming to the changes in all things, and inherently fair.
The ox and him completely adhered to their principles, becoming fleeting figures in the histories of various countries.
Later, they joined one of the three major forces, the Four Elephants Alliance.
Arriving at a large city of cultivators, they donned new outfits and assumed new identities. They worked quietly in an inconspicuous shop, dealing in information and never involving themselves in fights.
In front of the shop, they planted two trees, both Crane Spirit Trees.
No one knew their origins, only that they were mid-Golden Core stage cultivators. The man was very kind, and even the black ox spirit beast had a gentle demeanor.
Other vagabond cultivators in the Four Elephants Alliance respectfully called him Elder Xun.
Their ordinary days were always so pleasant yet filled with a sense of helplessness. As time passed, the years flowed by, and a hundred years had gone by since they had been in the Eastern countries.
Major news came from the northern part of Wu Nation, announcing a significant breakthrough in exploration. It was said that many spiritual herbs beneficial for the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages had been found.
Cultivators from various countries were thrilled and set off one after another. That place was an entirely undeveloped land of opportunities, where the first to seize it would own it.
Even many hesitant cultivators, upon hearing about the merit points, convinced themselves to join their fellow Daoists on the journey.
The entire cultivation world seemed to empty out, with fewer and fewer cultivators seen on the streets. Chen Xun and the big black ox just sat in front of their shop, smiling foolishly, unaffected by the cultivators passing overhead.
They had bought many books on minor spells and formations and spent their idle time reading them. Unbeknownst to others, a large map was gradually taking shape in Chen Xun's hands, marked with bright red dots.
They watched the people coming and going from their shop, chatting, and drinking tea, and the days passed one by one.
Time went by, and the Crane Spirit Trees in front of their shop shed their leaves again, marking another hundred years.
It seemed that the hidden great cultivators of various countries could no longer hold back and set off for the northern border of Wu Nation.
Chen Xun's Fireball Technique finally saw a minor enhancement, now comparable to an ordinary Foundation Establishment spell, with significantly increased power.
However, the spell was still simple to cast, consumed very little spiritual energy, and had few restrictions.
He named the spell "Starfall."
The big black ox, on the other hand, was studying another branch of formations: restrictions.
They changed into matching outfits again, wearing gray hemp robes, and the sound of jingling bells echoed on the streets.
After reporting for duty, Chen Xun and the big black ox left the Four Elephants Alliance and departed from the city.
...
Tonight, the night sky was dim, with a hazy moon and sparse starlight.
In a mountain range where spiritual energy converged, dark clouds shrouded the mountains.
Just being in this place or even looking at it brought a chill.
This was the territory of the Juque Sect, guarded by a great Golden Core stage cultivator, where the 'Spirit Throwing Black Mushroom,' one of the auxiliary herbs for the Infant Formation Pill, grew. Due to its strict environmental requirements, the Juque Sect directly occupied this mountain range to provide spiritual herbs for the three major forces.
