The Foundation Establishment Realm was a life-or-death trial for countless cultivators. Over time, rumors had spread about miraculous artifacts that could bolster success. Among these, the belief that materials related to their respective immortal foundation could secure breakthroughs was the most widespread. Although the Azure Pond Sect had long since disproved this myth through rigorous testing, Yang Xiao'er still held on to the idea that it's better to believe than not.
The Six-Colored Rainbow Mist happened to resonate with her husband's immortal foundation, so she set up a formation to confine it outside his cave, hoping to improve his chances of success.
Yang Xiao'er stared at the light for a while, silently praying in her heart.
In reality, she needn't have been so worried. Li Xizhi possessed exceptional natural talent, with a deep understanding of spells and scripture. He had also chosen an auspicious time to attempt his breakthrough and had the additional support of the Essence Gathering Pill and Profound Cluster Pill that she had procured from her family. The likelihood of failure was very slim.
Still, since it concerned her beloved, Yang Xiao'er couldn't help but be anxious, waiting patiently on the platform.
Beneath her, the sound of tinkling bells echoed softly as a middle-aged man ascended the platform. He had an unremarkable face and a somewhat earnest demeanor. Cupping his fist respectfully, he said, "Junior Sister, I must return to the family for a while."
This man was Yuan Chengzhao, a senior disciple and member of the Yuan Family. He was a late-stage Qi Cultivator, but today his face bore visible worry and hesitation.
Their master, Yuan Tuan, had left for the Eastern Sea Market and hadn't returned for several years. Being a member of the Yang Family, Yang Xiao'er was well aware of the situation—perhaps even more so than Yuan Chengzhao himself. She reassured him softly, "Worry not. Your esteemed clan still has six Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. No matter what, they will hold on."
Yuan Chengzhao shook his head and said softly, "If the six ancestors could truly work together, it would not be a problem... but..."
He smiled bitterly and continued, "My clan brother Yuan Chengdun is truly extraordinary in talent. Although he is said to be of the direct lineage, he was adopted from a branch family. Ancestor Huyuan is pushing for him to ascend the mountain as an elder… this has turned everything into a chaotic mess."
Yuan Chengzhao continued, "With our master still missing at the Eastern Sea and no steady hand to preside over the family, everyone covets those few treasures, turning the situation quite ugly."
This was the Yuan Family's internal conflict. Yang Xiao'er remained silent. Such disputes were not uncommon—when an ancestor fell, the resulting chaos often spread like ripples in water. The Yuan Family's predicament was, in fact, relatively mild.
Yuan Chengzhao, who had spent most of his life cultivating on the mountain, knew little of such matters. Just hearing rumors of the unrest at home left him anxious. Pacing restlessly, he vented his frustration, "What is the point of fighting over this? Why bother? If Chengdun ascends, so be it. With someone of his abilities, how could he remain stuck running errands at the foot of the mountain? Those few treasures are indeed wondrous, but could they not be shared in rotation? What is the point of all this struggle?"
Seeing his agitation, Yang Xiao'er realized he might suffer when returning home. She reminded him gently, "The struggle is not over positions alone. Behind it are vested interests, factional power, and even the laws that govern family hierarchies. Do not underestimate it; otherwise, you will end up like the Jiang Family of Jade Lake."
Yuan Chengzhao hesitated, then nodded in understanding. Yang Xiao'er, still deep in thought, asked, "When your elder failed to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, it triggered rainfall across four prefectures, lasting for months. The phenomenon was astonishing! It seems he was only one step away from success."
Yuan Chengzhao sighed. If a breakthrough succeeded, it would bring prestige to the family and joy to the sect, with congratulations pouring in from all directions. Yet failure meant a catastrophic loss of vital qi and prestige, leaving the family to suffer in silence—a stark and bitter contrast.
Yang Xiao'er dropped her gaze and murmured, "My family is no different. Our ancestor has been in seclusion attempting a breakthrough for decades. We wait in anticipation for a sign of success, yet quietly fear what might come instead..."
At this point, both of them suddenly looked up, sensing something. From the east, a vibrant rainbow light streaked across the sky, descending upon the mountain. In an instant, misty spiritual fog rose, and iridescent clouds filled the air.
"Senior Brother has done it!" Yuan Chengzhao exclaimed joyfully. Yang Xiao'er, unable to contain her excitement, leaped into the air, soaring down toward the light. Sure enough, the door to the cave dwelling had opened, and from within emerged a young man clad in a radiant feathered robe.
His features were refined and noble, his demeanor graceful and commanding. His broad shoulders and composed manner exuded an air of confidence and elegance. A faint smile played on his lips as he stepped forward and drew Yang Xiao'er into his arms.
Yang Xiao'er was stunned. The transformation in her husband's aura after his breakthrough was remarkable. Her cheeks flushed as she stammered, "This Universal Dawn Mist has refined your temperament… you seem even more regal now!"
Li Xizhi swept his spiritual sense across himself and indeed noticed that his appearance had become more refined and dignified. However, he didn't think much of it. With a casual grasp, he captured the Six-Colored Rainbow Mist and studied it closely, "A fine spirit item! It can be forged into a dharma artifact."
With Yang Xiao'er at his side, he ascended to the mountain peak just as Yuan Chengzhao approached them.
"Congratulations, Senior Brother!" Yuan Chengzhao offered his heartfelt congratulations, the worries on his face finally lifting. Not wanting to disturb the couple, he soon departed.
Li Xizhi watched him leave with a smile before turning to Yang Xiao'er. He led her back into the cave dwelling and embraced her gently, his voice soft and warm, "How have you been lately?"
Yang Xiao'er, cheeks still tinged pink, responded with a shy hum. Her excitement overflowed, and tears of joy glimmered in her eyes as she smiled.
Li Xizhi kissed her forehead before letting her go. Yang Xiao'er's gaze softened further as she looked at him, her eyes brimming with tenderness, refusing to look away.
The woman naturally saw her beloved as handsome. She leaned against him like a cat, listening as Li Xizhi said, "This Universal Dawn Mist excels at stealth techniques, rainbow-gathering, and spellcasting. Once I ride its light, I can move faster than most cultivators of the same realm. When casting spells, my speed will be even more remarkable. What is rarer is that it can condense rainbow mist to confuse enemies, strengthen a mountain or land, and nurture spiritual qi."
Yang Xiao'er smiled and said, "It is truly an excellent immortal foundation for one who holds a domain."
Li Xizhi paused, then added, "My breakthrough went smoothly enough. It has been years in the blink of an eye, and I do not know how things are at home. Now that I have entered the Foundation Establishment Realm, I should hurry back for a visit… I am sure my father will be delighted."
A look of eager expectation appeared on his face. Yang Xiao'er understood his feelings, though she knew nothing of what had happened in the grotto heaven. Just as she was about to share some happy news, an urgent knock echoed at the stone door. Li Xizhi stepped forward to open it, his face showing slight confusion.
Standing at the door, Yuan Chengzhao lowered his head and said quietly, "Senior Brother, I heard some news from outside… Yu Muxian is dead."
Li Xizhi froze, momentarily unable to rejoice at the news. Seeing his junior brother's somber expression, he recalled his past discussions with his younger brother, Li Xijun. In an instant, his heart sank, and he furrowed his brows, asking, "Who killed him?"
Yuan Chengzhao replied, "He and your honored father… perished together."
Li Xizhi's face turned pale, and he staggered back two steps. Yang Xiao'er hurriedly reached out to steady him. The three stood in silence for several moments, the stillness broken only when Yang Xiao'er realized her face had become damp.
Li Xizhi's tears trickled down his neck and fell onto his feathered robe. He pressed his lips together, forcing himself to say, "Thank you for telling me, Junior Brother."
He turned back to glance at the cave dwelling. When he faced forward again, his tears had vanished, and his expression had steadied. Locking the formation over the cave, Li Xizhi spoke softly, "I will go to the main peak to request leave for some matters and return home for the mourning."
Yuan Chengzhao added in a low voice, "I also need to return home. Why not travel together?"
