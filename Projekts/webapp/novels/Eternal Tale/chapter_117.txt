"But after two hundred years, if the friend does not continue to pay the spirit stones, the token will become invalid, and we will send someone to reclaim the cave residence."
"Thank you, thank you." Chen Xun carefully took the token and showed it to the big black ox for a while, "Then we won't disturb you any longer."
Just as they were about to leave, they were suddenly stopped.
"Friend, please wait; let me say one more thing."
"Please speak."
"If the friend is willing to pay for spirit stones for a thousand years, it is also acceptable. Even if the person is not present, we will not reclaim the residence, and it can also be used by future generations." The young man remained seated, with a slight smile on his lips, "This is also the sincerity of Yuxu City towards fellow cultivators."
Many years ago, a major incident occurred. A Yuanying Patriarch from his country had hidden his cultivation in a yellow-grade cave residence to recuperate secretly. Others coveted the stability and hidden power of Yuxu City.
He decisively paid for spirit stones for a thousand years, not wanting to be disturbed.
Who knew that four hundred years later, the residents' caves were taken back by others and sold...
Isn't this embarrassing? When the Yuanying Patriarch found out, he was furious. Representatives from the Top Ten Sects personally came to apologize, just to smooth things over. The cultivation world is not just about fighting and killing.
This rule on Qin Immortal Mountain was also established because of this incident.
Although he could tell at a glance that Chen Xun and his spiritual beast were not hidden old monsters, it was his duty to mention it.
As for what will happen in the future, he couldn't control it either. In fifty years, he would have to return to the sect to report.
After listening, Chen Xun couldn't help but give a thumbs up: "Truly worthy of Yuxu City, thank you for informing us."
"Moo!" The big black ox also responded politely.
"Friend, take care. If you have any questions, you can come to the Repairing Heart Pavilion to find me."
"Alright!" Chen Xun bowed respectfully and then left with the big black ox.
The young man sighed lightly. Unconsciously, he had walked to the window. The wind through the window stirred the bamboo, and a hint of melancholy appeared in his eyes.
Perhaps behind the refined and courteous facade, there were many untold stories.
After leaving the Repairing Heart Pavilion, Chen Xun and the big black ox hurriedly passed through the mountain guard formation.
Qin Immortal Mountain was quite large, with undulating peaks and dense forests, and the spiritual energy was much richer than in the city. The cave residences were far apart from each other, and there was also a set of defensive concealment formations surrounding them.
The winding path up the mountain was deep and secluded, rarely visited by people. The dense forest appeared particularly serene.
They walked cautiously, following the guidance of the token, afraid of triggering any restrictions set by others.
If they intruded without the consent of the cave residence owner, it would be disrespectful to the Top Ten Sects, and the consequences could be imagined.
"Old Ox, from now on, we'll have our own home, and it's legally purchased!" Chen Xun's eyes were filled with excitement, as if he were suppressing his emotions. He hugged the ox's head with one hand, "Our own home!"
"Moo!" The big black ox rubbed against Chen Xun, showing extreme joy in its eyes.
Even though they managed the medicinal garden territory in the Five Elements Sect, it always felt lacking.
"Hahaha..." Chen Xun didn't know why he was so happy, feeling even happier than when he broke through to the Golden Core stage.
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox's tail kept wagging. They understood each other's hearts.
Their cave residence was secluded, a bit far from the foot of the mountain, and even farther from the mountain top. Looking into the distance, it was still faintly visible, much larger than from afar.
Most importantly, there were many crane spirit trees in the mountain, so they could cut wood to make some wooden products, which made them very happy.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood outside their cave residence for a long time without taking a step.
The entrance to the cave was quite spacious—larger than any cave they had ever lived in before. It was surrounded by exotic flowers and plants, with a clear stream flowing in front of the entrance.
Inside the cave residence, there was a small medicinal field, as well as a small alchemy room, a small refining room, and a room for spiritual beasts.
Although the cave was deep, it was not dark. Various crystals were embedded in the walls, emitting a faint, non-glaring light, seemingly nourished by spiritual energy.
The walls of the cave resembled ancient turtle shells, intricately carved, and sculpted, exuding a harmonious natural beauty.
"Incredible... absolutely incredible!" Chen Xun suddenly shouted, startling the big black ox, who was mesmerized by the surroundings.
"Moo!" After the big black ox recovered, it gave Chen Xun a fierce nudge.
Chen Xun was pushed back several steps but remained excited. "Old Ox, why is it that others can sell their cave residences for spirit stones, but we can't?"
"Moo?" The big black ox fell into thought. It was indeed a question worth pondering. After all, the caves they dug weren't that bad...
"Ah, it's because we're not as professional. We don't pay attention to these details."
Smack!
Chen Xun slapped the big black ox hard, feeling frustrated. "Look, the area within the array covering a three-mile radius is all ours. We could make a fortune out of this!"
"Moo!" The big black ox's pupils dilated. It didn't understand the concept of covered area, but when Chen Xun said they could make a fortune, then they definitely could!
"Old Ox, let's get to work!"
"Moo!"
Excited, they started inspecting everything. Chen Xun grabbed his axe and went to chop wood, while the big black ox roamed around the cave residence.
It wanted to find a secluded place to grow spiritual herbs. Although Chen Xun mentioned alchemy, the medicinal field was too obvious.
In the end, it decided to dig a hole in the ground of the cave residence, right in the room for spiritual beasts. It began to set up arrays around it because it felt that the arrays outside the cave were not that reliable.
Meanwhile, Chen Xun was busy outside the cave, doing some carpentry work. He even made a plaque for their home.
He started inscribing words: "Chen Xun and the big black ox's home."
They worked in tandem, bustling about. If there were any nice stones nearby, they would bring them back to decorate the surroundings.
From time to time, shouts from Chen Xun and "moos" from the big black ox could be heard from inside the cave residence.
This was the first time they had been so serious about arranging their cave residence, striving to make every detail perfect. Even the pots and pans were placed in their designated spots.
Their status had now become second only to their main magic treasures, and no amount of spirit stones could replace their bond.
Two days later, the cave residence finally quieted down.
A ray of sunlight from the eastern horizon slanted in, dispersing the morning mist, which seemed to be thinning and dissipating. The night's accumulated fog gradually dispersed, leaving a light and airy atmosphere.
Chen Xun and the big black ox leaned against a huge rock, eyes slightly closed, enjoying the fragrance of flowers and the mountain breeze. They didn't speak a word, appearing remarkably relaxed.
Chen Xun had already made plans for the future and was completely at ease.
Over the next month, Chen Xun began refining Foundation Establishment stage pills - Frost Spirit Pills—the prescription of which he obtained from the Five Elements Sect.
It was highly beneficial for early Foundation Establishment cultivation and was a popular pill on the market.
When Chen Xun began refining this pill, he chose an auspicious time and casually said, "I'll just do it as I please."
The big black ox admired him so much that it worshiped Chen Xun on the spot, starting to set up an altar for him. Chen Xun punched it against the cave wall, and it took a while for the big black ox to come to its senses.
