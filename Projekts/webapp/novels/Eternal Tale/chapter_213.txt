One month later, Chen Xun and the big black ox finally sensed some changes, and it became clear that the God-killing power was indeed targeting their spiritual consciousness.
They were sitting atop a tree, their eyes scanning the surroundings. As the saying goes, "The higher you sit, the farther you can see," and their spiritual consciousness was more effective here than their eyesight.
"Old Ox, the Five Elements Immortal Path may be about to undergo another change."
"Moo~~"
The big black ox felt deeply about it. They had been studying the changes in their spiritual consciousness, and now the Five Elements Immortal Path had only caused an anomaly in the spiritual energy of their bodies.
Chen Xun took a deep breath. The God-killing power was still far from enough to use the Five Elements power as a medium to transform their spiritual consciousness towards the Five Elements Immortal Path.
"Moo!"
"Huh, big fellow."
Chen Xun turned his gaze toward the direction of the big black ox's voice. There was a small mountain composed entirely of this kind of mineral, with an intense dark glow and flickering at a rapid frequency.
The spider web-like network within the mountain was enough to make one's scalp tingle.
**Buzz—**
The flying boat slowly moved towards it. They looked down at the small mountain, and the brilliant Five Elements divine light erupted from their bodies, wrapping and decomposing from top to bottom.
They had become quite adept at decomposing this kind of mineral along the way—fast, accurate, and ruthless.
At this moment, the small mountain of mineral was being decomposed and consumed by Chen Xun and the big black ox at a visibly slow pace, with the dark wind swirling and making its last struggle.
"Old Ox, this is to rid the immortal world of harm; we can't leave it behind!"
"Moo moo!!"
After an incense stick's worth of time, they exchanged glances, and grinned, and the entire mountain turned to ashes, becoming dust in history.
Chen Xun shivered, feeling the God-killing power. His spiritual consciousness had not grown, but there was a sudden sensation of enlightenment.
"Old Ox, do you feel it?"
"Moo!"
"Indeed, the spiritual consciousness of our Five Elements Immortal Path also has its acupoints, defined as divine acupoints. With this God-killing power as a supplement, it helps us break through these acupoints!"
"Moo~~~!"
The big black ox was excited all over, releasing a long breath. The elder brother's Five Elements Immortal Path was indeed advancing further.
**Buzz!**
The flying boat continued its journey. Chen Xun's eyes were increasingly bright. What exactly were these minerals? They were certainly not ordinary.
The big black ox didn't think much of it. It scanned everywhere for flickering dark glows, following the elder brother's instructions and helping with the work.
**Boom!**
**Boom!**
The Plains's bottom began to produce roaring sounds again, and the howling of the dark wind seemed to grow louder and more tragic.
One year later, Chen Xun and the big black ox were sitting on the deck of the boat, their eyes calm, while a dark glow swirled above their heads.
Their spiritual consciousness was undergoing a remarkable transformation, with surging spiritual power pouring out and the surrounding dark wind instantly sweeping in.
"Old Ox, stop!"
"Moo?"
"This path created by my ancestor is natural for me to comprehend first."
"Moo~" The big black ox, trusting his elder brother, immediately withdrew his spiritual consciousness, and the dark glow above him faded.
Chen Xun's eyes were bloodshot, with slight bleeding at the corners. His spiritual consciousness was being destroyed; he needed to break free from the constraints of the spiritual energy immortal path step by step.
The big black ox's eyes widened, observing Chen Xun's changes. What was the elder brother doing?!
At this moment, in Chen Xun's mind.
The Five Elements Nascent Souls were shrouded in a hazy glow, their expressions showing pain. The disintegration of the spiritual consciousness could already affect the Nascent Souls.
He was now experiencing both pain and pleasure; the disintegration seemed to purify, accompanied by the powerful fluctuations of the Five Elements power, with the God-killing power constantly surging.
Chen Xun could faintly glimpse a thread of the Five Elements spiritual consciousness network in the void.
"Break for me!"
He let out a painful cry. The Five Elements Nascent Souls gradually coalesced into a human form above his head, tightly binding the God-killing power; otherwise, it would follow the disintegration of the spiritual consciousness.
**Boom!**
Chen Xun felt millions of thunderclaps exploding in his mind simultaneously! A prototype of an acupoint was gradually forming, but it did not appear in his body.
It was quite ethereal and elusive, like the place where spiritual consciousness first sprouted during the breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment stage.
"Old Ox, bring more minerals!"
"Moo!"
The big black ox's eyes widened, transforming into a beam of divine light. Without a word, it swept through the Plains, and the minerals were continuously gathered onto the boat's deck.
Chen Xun waved his hand, and the minerals were rapidly decomposed by the Five Elements power, turning into God-killing power to strengthen himself.
He slowly closed his eyes, his mind bombarded by the sounds of thunder.
An acupoint was forming independently from the earth and human acupoints, slowly taking shape like a small black hole, mysterious and unfathomable.
For several days, the big black ox never stopped, constantly moving minerals. Chen Xun didn't say stop, so it continued.
Chen Xun sighed with relief, glad to have the big black ox by his side; otherwise, the formation of the divine acupoints might have been in vain, rotting away and never forming.
"That's enough. We've taken the first step."
Chen Xun's spiritual consciousness erupted with God-killing power, turning into a vast storm. The surrounding ground cracked, shattered, and disintegrated!
One thought shattered the ground!
"Moo?!!" The big black ox was shocked, its scalp tingling and unable to speak coherently. What kind of spell was this, "Moo moo moo??!"
Chen Xun hadn't used the Five Elements power, so why did the surrounding ground shatter?
"Hehe, is this the limit of this body..." Chen Xun's pupils were deep and dark as he looked at the big black ox, showing an inexplicable, low laugh.
"Moo??!" The big black ox, scared, retreated into the boat's formation and quickly summoned the incense burner.
"Hahaha... Damn it, Old Ox, come over here."
"Moo moo~~"
The big black ox, excited, let out a breath and hurried over to Chen Xun, rubbing against him vigorously.
"Old Ox, my divine acupoint is open, and I can now use this God-killing power, but one divine acupoint is far from the limit." Chen Xun patted the big black ox's head, his eyes filled with joy. "Old Ox, let's mine. I'll open your acupoints too."
"Moo~~" The big black ox looked at Chen Xun in confusion, not quite understanding.
"Let's go. I'll explain to you while we mine. I'll start by analyzing the booklet."
"Moo~"
They suddenly burst into laughter on the boat, which began to move, travelling everywhere. They didn't know where they were going.
Wherever there were minerals, they went. They weren't in a hurry, with plenty of lifespans ahead, and vowed not to leave until they had mined it all.
**Buzz—**
**Buzz—**
A massive flying boat slowly sailed through various places, its deck piled high with minerals.
All of them were flashing dark glow, dazzling and eye-catching—rare treasures in the immortal world. Chen Xun and the big black ox thought so and couldn't get enough of them.
In the following days, they were thoroughly busy, starting to cultivate their divine acupoints and using these minerals to break through.
Chen Xun could feel the difference between divine acupoints and spiritual consciousness.
They were no longer afraid of the God-killing power. Instead, they could turn the virtual into the real, using divine acupoints to attack silently.
Three years later, Chen Xun and the big black ox had completely opened their divine acupoints on the boat, creating a total of sixteen divine acupoints!
However, they had reached a bottleneck. Their spiritual consciousness had not increased; they had only converted their Nascent Soul spiritual consciousness into divine acupoints.
They were no longer afraid of using spiritual consciousness to explore, and the Tian Duan Plains had completely become their domain. They had no idea how many minerals they had mined.
Although the number of divine acupoints could no longer increase, they could still decompose and store the God-killing power.
