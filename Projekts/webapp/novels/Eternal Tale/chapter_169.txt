He slowly raised his head to look at the night sky. Amidst the sky, clouds were shattered and dispersed.
**Boom!**
A celestial sound echoed through the heavens and earth; distant thunder rumbled as if it came from ancient times.
The weather was changing. Heavy thunderclouds rolled in, and an atmosphere of grim determination arose between heaven and earth. The wind and sand throughout the land stilled, awaiting the arrival of a true king.
While the heavenly tribulation was preparing, Chen Xun was also preparing.
A green smoke curled around him, Qi Condensation talismans spread in all directions, his eyes slightly closed, he looked up and shouted:
"I am breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, and I did not expect the heavens to bestow a blessing. Thank you for your selfless gift! I shall receive it devoutly. Back then, in my ignorance, I offended the heavens. I hope for forgiveness!!" Chen Xun kept shouting, his hands never idle, with eighteen incense burners surrounding him, "With merit upon me, may the Buddha bless me!!!"
"Moo!!!"
The big black ox realized more, already kneeling in mid-air. Big brother's methods opened its eyes, and it even began to form new ideas.
At this moment, the thunderclouds had gathered above Chen Xun, and bolts of purple lightning exploded, brewing a terrifying force.
The wind had picked up. The howling wind roared like a tidal wave, but Chen Xun had already shielded the incense burners and other items with a protective barrier, unaffected.
The majestic heavenly might carried a destructive thunderous aura that rampaged within the thunderclouds.
The thunderclouds raged like the fury of the heavens, and with thunderbolts locking onto Chen Xun's aura, a pillar of lightning struck down!
**Boom!**
Lightning arcs spread across the ground, rumbling loudly. The dazzling light made it impossible to see what was inside; it seemed like Chen Xun was being obliterated.
The big black ox's eyes widened; its consciousness was unable to discern what was happening inside.
"Damn, thank you for the body-tempering power!" A voice came from the ground, filled with great joy. Chen Xun was unscathed, even standing up and cupping his hands.
The heavenly might within the thunderclouds was as vast as the ocean, ready to pour down at any moment, unleashing dragons of electricity!
**Boom!**
Before Chen Xun could finish speaking, a thick lightning bolt pierced from the heavens to the earth, boundless and terrifying, shaking the entire land once more.
The lightning tribulation pierced the surrounding sand sea, shattering the area. The sound of the lightning burst, making one's ears bleed, unbearably.
"Moo~~~~" The big black ox was dumbfounded, constantly snorting. Even Chen Xun's protective barrier was not penetrated...
"The heavens are generous and magnanimous! I accept this pure thunder power!" Chen Xun, who had stood up, was forcefully blasted to the ground, feeling the changes in his body. The cracks on one of his Golden Cores were growing larger.
One after another, the furious lightning bolts continued to strike, while the ground still emitted green smoke. The one undergoing the tribulation remained devout, without any sense of hardship or hatred.
"Not enough, I need more." Chen Xun felt the changes in his Golden Core and swallowed another Nurture Pill. The cracks on the surface of the Golden Core expanded more rapidly.
**Boom!**
The heavenly tribulations continued to descend fiercely, turning the ground around Chen Xun into scorched earth. Yet he faced it without fear, feeling nothing but reverence, gritting his teeth, and enduring the strikes.
Time passed slowly, the thunderous explosions of the grand lightning tribulation growing louder.
Chen Xun had already closed his eyes and sat cross-legged, with the eighteen incense burners still representing his devotion. At this moment, a gentle light sphere rose from within him.
One after another, Nurture Pills continued to be swallowed, causing a terrifying transformation both inside and out.
The big black ox had hidden away; the power of the heavenly tribulation was too terrifying, not wanting to affect Chen Xun.
The light sphere was growing larger; even under the dark cover of the lightning tribulation, it remained dazzlingly bright, gradually enveloping Chen Xun's head.
At this moment, Chen Xun's mind wandered as if he were in another world. It felt like a dream. You knew it was fake, yet you couldn't help but be immersed in it.
However, the external protective barrier of spiritual energy still surrounded him, adding both power and defense. Even in the face of heavenly tribulation, consumption was only slightly greater.
Chen Xun seemed to be in a forest, a world filled with crane spirit treesâ€”quite absurd. Yet, his gaze remained clear. His demeanor was transcendent and detached, holding firm to his heart, completely unaffected by external influences.
Throughout his journey, no cultivator had experienced as much as he had before breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, for he had already surpassed the lifespan of the Golden Core stage.
He instinctively wielded an axe, chopping down a large swath of crane spirit trees. He didn't understand what the Heart Refinement Tribulation was; he just acted according to his heart.
Various illusions came one after another, but Chen Xun remained a mere observer, never getting lost in them and always aware that they were false.
He met many old friends, chatted with them, saw Little Hei, the old village chief, Old Sun, Master Ning...
Chen Xun felt deeply moved. This tribulation was quite pleasant, allowing him to see so many old friends, even if it was just to say hello.
Each past scene seemed to want to pull him in, but he remained serene and peaceful, facing everything with a smile.
"I know this is a dream..." Chen Xun's lips curled into a warm smile as he slowly closed his eyes.
Outside, the heavenly tribulation continued to shine violently, with lightning coursing through the thunderclouds.
**Boom!**
In the next instant, the thunderclouds roared, lightning surged, and a massive bolt of lightning struck down again!
Chen Xun's eyebrows twitched slightly. Multicolored divine light shimmered around him, and within the light sphere, a boundless and vast power surged like an ocean.
The light sphere transformed into a gigantic light shadow that reached the sky and earth. An arm extended from it, grasping the descending lightning bolt directly!
The light shadow bathed in terrifying lightning, not as menacing and fierce, but with an indescribable domineering aura.
**Crack!** **_Crack..._**
The earth trembled, lightning flashed endlessly, and a bolt of lightning was crushed deeply, turning into pure body-tempering power.
Countless lightning bolts intertwined, creating a terrifying sight. A new round of tribulation began. Intense light shone from the thunderclouds, cascading like a waterfall, boundless and vast.
Chen Xun's aura, enhanced by the light shadow, became as imposing as a mountain, heavy and majestic, constantly amplifying.
The big black ox was almost scared into a faint, feeling weak all over. Looking at the enormous light shadow that reached the sky, I felt a deep fear of life and death.
Chen Xun's expression grew more comfortable. The tribulation seemed to be gradually retreating, and radiant light began to emerge in the dark night.
**Crack!**
A crisp sound came from within Chen Xun's body, tempered by the tribulation. Some sort of shackle seemed to have completely broken.
His flesh and blood pulsated violently, his bones crackling, and a tremendous power spread from the depths of his flesh.
The thick thunderclouds in the sky had dissipated, and seven-colored radiance illuminated the surroundings, lighting up the entire desolate night sky.
"Moo~~" The big black ox stared in amazement at the surroundings; it was so dazzling...
Chen Xun slowly opened his eyes, and a majestic light shadow stood behind him with five heads and ten arms! He gazed down at the heavens and earth like a magnificent sun, radiating majesty.
The form of the light shadow terrified the big black ox, causing it to lie on the ground, sweating profusely. What kind of overwhelming power was this...
After a thousand years of cultivation, he had finally reached the pinnacle of the cultivation world in the Qian Nation, becoming the Patriarch Chen Xun!!
Radiant light shone through the night, celebrating with the sun and moon, the stars, and the entire universe.
