The End! Demon Realm Survival!
* * *
Emi’s strike delivered with all her mind and soul.
Her rage.
Her overflowing murderous intent.
It couldn’t even scratch the black dragon’s cornea.
The overwhelming disparity in their existences as living beings.
That was made utterly clear.
For a mere 7-year-old human’s fist to strike the legendary entity living since the mythological era was simply far too small.
Yet.
<<<Ohhhh……>>>
Yet, the black dragon trembled.
<<<Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!>>>
And it shed tears.
That previous strike.
The all-out blow unleashed by that minuscule human.
A strike that should have been insignificant to it, unable to harm even its eye.
However, that strike.
That fist.
That human!
If only for an instant, undoubtedly.
Undoubtedly, undoubtedly!!
It had left the black dragon awestruck.
And undoubtedly!!
It had instilled terror in him!!
That strike had contained a mere glimpse of what the black dragon had awaited obsessively!
It was convinced of that much.
<<<OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!>>>
The black dragon was overwhelmed with emotion.
Hence the tears.
It gently caught the falling human’s body in its right hand.
Observing her condition, she seemed unable to even move a single finger.
Breathing raggedly with her shoulders.
Yet the flames of rage still burned in her eyes.
Murderous intent overflowed from her.
Brimming with the will to live!
<<<Magnificent>>>
The black dragon inadvertently murmured that single word.
<<<That was a magnificent battle. Human, you, what is your name?>>>
“………..”
The human remained silent in response to the black dragon’s question.
Only continuing to glare at it.
The black dragon couldn’t help but wryly smile.
<<<My name is Gazangist Oll Deorthol. You may call me Oll. ……Human, won’t you tell me your name?>>>
“……Emi.”
The human answered in a faint voice.
<<<I see, Emi. So that is the name of the one fated for me.>>>
The black dragon murmured those profound words, incomprehensible to Emi.
Just what was this black lizard babbling about?
It really was insane, wasn’t it?
Such thoughts crossed her mind.
<<<However, hmm. Taking a closer look, you’re still just a juvenile, aren’t you? Mmm, I acted prematurely, yes, far too premature. I got overly excited. My apologies, Emi.>>>
In that manner, the black dragon effectively apologized to Emi with a “Whoops, I got a bit carried away there! Sorry about that!” sort of attitude.
While exasperated, Emi lacked the physical and magical strength to react.
Thus, she simply accepted the apology in silence.
<<<As an apology and reward for entertaining me despite your small stature, accept this.>>>
Saying that, the black dragon promptly bit into one of the fingers on its left arm.
Pitch-black blood gushed out, dripping down.
The black dragon poured that blood into Emi’s mouth.
“……?!”
The instant it entered, searing pain coursed through Emi’s entire body!!
“Gah!? Ah, aaah, GAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!?”
Overwhelmed by the agony, Emi shrieked and thrashed about on the black dragon’s palm!
The black dragon’s blood.
It contained an immense magic power exceeding human intellect.
Even a single drop, if ingested by an ordinary person, would prove a lethal toxin their body and soul could not withstand, resulting in rupture and death.
However, the black dragon was convinced Emi, this small human, was not the possessor of a soul that would perish from such a degree.
She would subjugate even the raging dragon’s blood, make it her own power, and rise again, stronger and mightier.
It was convinced of this.
“AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!! Ah, ah, AAAAAAAAHHHH!!”
<<<Grow stronger, Emi.>>>
Toward the thrashing girl on its palm, the black dragon spoke with a gentle, affectionate smile.
“AAAAAAAAHHHH!! AAAAAAAHHHH!! AH, AAAHHHH!!”
<<<Wander the world. And devour the world. And at last, devour me. Splendidly demonstrate your ability to slay me. You already belong to me. Next, you shall make me yours.>>>
“Aaaahhhh!! Aahh……! Ah……aaaaaahh……”
<<<I waited. I continued waiting for so very long. Thus……I shall continue waiting, even if it takes another few thousand years. For the time when you grow strong enough to kill me.>>>
“Ah……! Ah……Ah, ah……”
<<<Grow stronger, Emi.>>>
“………..”
Emi no longer even twitched.
Her eyes rolled back, having lost consciousness.
Yet she did not perish.
Seeing her state, the black dragon nodded in satisfaction before casually tossing Emi toward the nearby Jacoby River.
Emi’s body, dropped from dozens of meters high, plunged into the raging muddy torrent with a resounding splash before quickly vanishing from sight.
At the other end of this river lay the human world.
For now, it would be best for her to return there and rest her body.
The black dragon calmly smiled.
Then it continued gazing steadily along the river’s flow into the distance, unflinching.
Author’s note: This concludes Arc 7.
“The protagonist has been growing stronger lately, so the battles haven’t been too difficult” → “Alright, let’s have her fight the mythologically strongest being!”
……This arc really exposed my lack of skill, or rather poor judgment, in battle power balancing.
Thank you for reading up to this point.
Your bookmarks, star ratings, impressions, reviews…I am truly grateful for them all.
Once Arc 8 is completely written, I will post the next update. So there will be a brief break until then.
I appreciate your continued support for “The Reincarnated Extra” going forward.
