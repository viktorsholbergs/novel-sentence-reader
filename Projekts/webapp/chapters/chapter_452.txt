Li Yuanjiao carefully stowed away the two items before tossing the storage pouch back to the rogue cultivator, who was still bowing while kneeling before him. Observing the man, Li Yuanjiao discerned that despite his ragged appearance, the man practiced a proper Qi cultivation method. His hands were unusually soft and fair, showing that he was likely versed in the arts of immortal cultivation.
This aroused Li Yuanjiao's suspicion.
"Are you a rogue cultivator?" he asked.
Recognizing that Li Yuanjiao was no easy target to deceive, the rogue cultivator secretly thought to himself, This man is cautious and didn't kill me outright… Surely, he isn't a devil cultivator! Perhaps he belongs to one of the three sects or seven gates, or a prestigious immortal clan… These people are knowledgeable; deceit would surely backfire...
Adjusting his strategy, the rogue cultivator lifted his head, shedding any previous semblance of cowardice, and explained in a respectful manner, "I was once a cultivator from Wu State. My sect was destroyed by devil cultivators, forcing me to seek refuge in Yue State…"
Li Yuanjiao, impressed by his composed tone and demeanor, contemplated recruiting him, thinking to himself, If I treat him with kindness, perhaps I could acquire the secret techniques of Wu State and an ally for my family…
However, Li Yuanjiao was inherently distrustful. Sensing the man's true essence for a brief moment, he felt an unnerving familiarity. A chilling thought flashed through his mind suddenly, causing him to mutter in shock, "Slaughter Jun Gate?!"
Startled at being recognized so quickly, the rogue cultivator immediately pressed his forehead to the ground again. Realizing that he could no longer conceal his identity, he replied solemnly, "Yes... May I inquire who Senior is…?"
Li Yuanjiao recalled the old monkey and the Slaughter Jun Kui Light technique he had acquired years ago.
He mused to himself, Such a coincidence! How could we dare to involve ourselves with them right now? The Slaughter Jun Gate was devastated during the devil plague… Who knows they might be scheming?!
Besides, this man is no ordinary character; he might be a serpent dragon with a significant fate!
Deciding against taking advantage of the situation, Li Yuanjiao dropped the damaged dharma artifact from the devil cultivator onto the ground and emptied his storage pouch.
Several bottles of the devil cultivator's blood pills, over a dozen Spirit Stones, and a couple of low-quality dharma artifacts, along with the Fire Baleful Qi and Yang Nourishing Technique manual came tumbling out.
After a brief inspection of the manual, he hastily repacked them and said, "I have received favors from Slaughter Jun Gate… Consider these items as repayment. Take them and sell them after you leave!"
For the first time in their conversation, the rogue cultivator's composure wavered, now stricken with genuine shock. After a stunned silence, he hurriedly asked, "Senior, may I ask for your name?"
Already riding on the wind, Li Yuanjiao simply replied, "This is not the time to talk, leave quickly!"
The rogue cultivator's eyes reddened slightly, managing only to call out, "Tu Longjian will never forget the kindness you have shown him today! I shall repay you generously in the future!"
Eager to avoid trouble, Li Yuanjiao swiftly departed. Once he landed safely back in his cave dwelling, he breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders.
He mused quietly, "I don't really care about the repayment, I just hope he won't bring danger to our family… Given that demon cultivators have the backing of an immortal sect, there must be more to the Slaughter Jun Gate incident than meets the eye, just like the mystery surrounding the Xiao Family… My family has received the two legacies with fear. Only those who have lost their minds would involve themselves with those from Slaughter Jun Gate…"
Li Yuanjiao had briefly examined the Yang Nourishing Technique in Tu Longjian's possession. It appeared to be a method for converting one type of spirit fire into another, but it required numerous spirit items and extensive knowledge. However, the manual was thick with a lot of content. Cautious of potential traps, he dared not delve too deeply into it.
After thinking for a moment, he decided that it should be safe to examine the storage pouches, so he took out the three of them excitedly.
The storage pouches from the father and daughter were ordinary, but the final pouch from the daring demon cultivator seemed of superior quality. Li Yuanjiao looked at it for a bit and grew suspicious again as he mumbled, "I'll have someone open this back at home rather than risking it myself…"
He had handed over the dharma artifacts from the father and daughter to Tu Longjian, so there was little left in his possession—only two jade bottles.
One was left by the fleeing demon cultivator. It was slender, about two fingers wide, and adorned with silver patterns. Although small, it looked exquisite. Li Yuanjiao channeled his true essence into it, watching as colorful brilliance danced across its surface before it released a white mist.
The mist continued to rise, gradually creating a faint veil of concealment around him. Under its cover, his body seemed to vanish, leaving the cave dwelling suddenly empty.
The mist, perhaps attuned to the Jing Dragon King immortal foundation, seemed to resonate intimately with him, swirling around him protectively. It was only then that realization dawned upon Li Yuanjiao.
This must be the dharma artifact that the demon cultivator used to conceal himself! I wonder where he got it from… The patterns on the bottle are definitely unusual. They're nothing like what I've seen before.
He inverted the bottle and immediately heard the sound of rain before a stream of crystal-clear spring water poured out like flowing silk, weaving through the air like a snake.
Li Yuanjiao peered closer, intrigued.
Engraved at the bottom of the bottle were the words—Li Qianyuan from the Li Family of the Wei State.
"Wei State… So the Li Family still existed in the ancient Wei State…"
No wonder I couldn't detect that demon cultivator; this artifact is a Foundational Establishment Realm dharma artifact... He was decisive, cautious and even had such a prized item in his possession.
The Profound Patterned Bottle not only concealed one's figure but also served as a protective dharma artifact when inverted. The mist within could ward off spells and enhance wind control, making it a truly versatile artifact.
"Excellent! I'll name it the Profound Patterned Bottle."
Acquiring this artifact made Li Yuanjiao's journey worthwhile. The Azure Manifestation, a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, was a generous gift from Yuan Tuan when she visited the Li Family. Although such artifacts were easily obtainable for peak masters of the three sects and seven gates, they were treasures to clan cultivators.
Another jade bottle contained a spirit fire known as the Profound Yang Li Fire. Li Yuanjiao was unfamiliar with this bright golden-red flame, but he could feel its intense heat painfully searing his spiritual senses.
Gazing toward the sky, he left the cave dwelling on a gust of wind, activating the Profound Patterned Bottle, and flew amidst the mist toward the Profound Peak Gate.
Meanwhile in the Li Family…
Although Li Yuanjiao had been away for some time, news of his breakthrough had spread across the six mountains. The cultivators at home rejoiced, and a few guest cultivators breathed sighs of relief and could finally rest easy.
Li Tongya had been absent for over a decade, raising suspicions among the guest and external cultivators. However, given his formidable reputation, none dared to inquire further.
After all, he was Li Qiuyang and Chen Donghe's mentor, and could subdue even An Zheyan. His penetrating gaze, having once swept over everyone, still lingered vividly in their memories even after more than ten years.
Li Yuanjiao's breakthrough further solidified everyone's confidence. Several families sent congratulatory gifts, masking any jealousy with outward expressions of congratulations.
In the old central hall, Li Yuanping calculated the family's finances meticulously, occasionally writing something on his desk. Li Qinghong stood at his side with her spear. Having consumed a talisman pill, she now radiated the aura of a Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer.
Li Yuanping reviewed the ledger, carefully explaining the details to Li Qinghong, who was listening attentively.
"With this new system, our family's surplus this year has decreased by seventeen or eighteen Spirit Stones," he reported.
The Li Family's most productive territory was Mount Yue's Wutu Mansion. With seventy Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators working tirelessly, it generated twenty Spirit Stones annually. After accounting for seven to eight hundred jin of Spirit Paddies as salaries, a surplus of fourteen Spirit Stones remained.
Next was Huazhong Mansion, which earned sixteen Spirit Stones and after paying out six to seven hundred jin of Spirit Paddies as salaries, and a surplus of about ten remained.
The remaining Lijing, Huaqian, and Yuting were less fertile, each yielding only seven or eight Spirit Stones. With fewer workers, these mountains managed a surplus of two to three Spirit Stones each, totaling eight altogether.
