"Don't worry, old ox, once we have money, I'll buy you a wooden carving of a little female cow."
"Moo, Moo~"
The big black ox immediately understood and happily mooed twice.
That day was the last day of the year, and sky lanterns were slowly rising from the river, carrying the people's good wishes for the coming year, and illuminating the entirety of Panning City.
Chen Xun looked up at the sky, a faint smile unconsciously appearing on his lips.
"Old ox, shall we be a little extravagant today and release sky lanterns of our own?"
"Moo! Moo!"
The big black ox's eyes sparkled; there was no way it would refuse. It had plenty of wishes in its heart.
The riverbank was crowded with people, and there was a chance that even some cultivators were among them. Thankfully, Chen Xun found people selling lanterns in some corner of the city, so he went ahead and bought two. That way, they didn’t need to squeeze into the crowded areas.
"Old ox, what's your wish? They say writing it down makes it more effective."
Chen Xun held a piece of charcoal and looked at the animal. "Didn't I teach you how to write? Go ahead, hold it and write."
"Moo!"
The big black ox snatched the charcoal with its mouth, and its eyes showed a thoughtful look as it began to write on the sky lantern.
"Hehe… I hope it's not something like a little cow."
Chen Xun chuckled sneakily, looking at the sky lantern of his companion. If it turned out to be a little female cow sitting on the sky lantern, it would be truly awesome.
"Forever… forever what?" Chen Xun frowned.
The big black ox's writing was crooked and twisted.
_Follow… Chen_
Looking at the writing, his heart skipped a beat, and he looked fondly at the animal.
Soon after, the two sky lanterns were slowly released, blending into the myriad of lights, and gradually disappearing.
"Moo?"
The big black ox nudged Chen Xun.
“Now that I think about it… if you reveal your wish, it probably won’t come true,” Chen Xun said playfully.
Startled, the black ox made a wish again, although in secret this time, and didn't nudge him anymore.
The man and ox started to wander around Panning City at night, and Chen Xun took the opportunity to scout for any odd jobs to do in the city. After all, he was now skilled in all kinds of martial arts.
Chen Xun continued to focus on enhancing his swiftness this year as well, and after reaping his point, he went ahead and increased his speed. He also gave a little boost to the black ox.
The next day, Chen Xun went to a blacksmith shop in the city, presenting himself in a formidable manner, which stunned the owner, who thought they were there to cause trouble.
"Young man, we don't hire oxen here."
"I am a mighty blacksmithing god, and I feel that your smithery might be missing something without me."
"What are you talking about…?"
"Why don’t you hire us, boss?" Chen Xun smiled brightly, revealing his arm. "Two for the price of one. And with the help of my ancestral Big Black Ox, I guarantee your business will flourish."
**_Bang!_**
Chen Xun was kicked out.
The blacksmith shop owner spat, "Do you think I hire just anyone with questionable backgrounds?"
"Moo!"
Furious, the black ox spat back in response. How dare the owner insult them?
Chen Xun quickly restrained his companion and said coldly, "There are other places that will welcome us. Let's leave."
The owner crossed his arms, and several other blacksmiths appeared behind him. Their stance indicated that if Chen Xun kept pushing, things would get physical.
Silently, Chen Xun held onto the ox’s rope, not saying another word, and started running as he pulled the animal along.
"Tch!" The people at the smithery sighed and waved them off, then returned to their work.
On their way back, the black ox kept nudging Chen Xun, urging him not to be angry.
"It's okay. I've done some research, and there's another smithery on the street nearby. I heard their business is struggling. Let's check that one out."
"Moo!"
The ox nodded.
When they arrived at the second smithery, Chen Xun was shocked. It seemed like it was already on the brink of going out of business. An old man was sitting on a chair, dozing off.
"Old man." Noticing there were no customers, Chen Xun led the black ox inside, "...Hey."
The old man was startled and quickly got up. Groggy, the old man’s eyes were still cloudy and unfocused. "What do you want, young man?"
"Hehe, I am a mighty smithing god. Are you hiring blacksmiths?"
"Haha... Yes, we are." The old man nodded abruptly. "All the blacksmiths in the shop have left since there's no money for me to pay them."
"It's alright, boss. Just give us a place to stay."
"That's fine then." The old man smiled happily. "You can stay in the backyard of the shop if you’d like."
With both parties reaching an agreement, the duo got to work. Chen Xun arranged their pots and pans, while the ox looked for places to stash the rice.
"This world is indeed vast." Chen Xun sighed.
The shop was so large that even the black ox could move around freely without any issues.
An hour later, they began to work together. The shop echoed with clangs. The old man's eyes widened, amazed by the tremendous strength they displayed.
"Young man, judging by your technique, this isn’t your first time smithing, is it?" The old man's eyes gleamed as he crossed his hands behind his back. "Your technique is a bit rough, though."
"Of course, old man. I won't hide it from you. I have five years of experience. Any place that hires me will surely benefit." Chen Xun boasted. He enjoyed blacksmithing; it was a good way to practice controlling his strength. However, he still lacked the finesse required for specialized work.
"The way you forge won't do." Seeing the way Chen Xun wasted his strength, the old man shook his head. "Let me show you."
As the old man took over, Chen Xun was left impressed at his unique blacksmithing technique. It was different from any other he had seen in the village. However, the old man was soon breathless. "I'm getting old, I'm getting old. You try."
The old man waved and stepped to the side. He glimpsed at the black ox and couldn’t help but notice a glimmer of intelligence in its bell-like eyes.
"Alright."
Chen Xun imitated the old man's technique, and surprisingly, it worked. It seemed that his control over his strength was gradually improving.
In the following year, Chen Xun, accompanied by the black ox, practiced blacksmithing daily. The old man, Mr. Sun Kaiyue, was there to provide guidance and even offered some pointers to the ox.
Whether it was immortals or ordinary people, everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Chen Xun had benefited greatly from Mr. Sun Kaiyue’s wisdom, and his days working in the smithery were fruitful.
"Mr. Sun, our shop's business is getting better and better." Chen Xun grinned.
Now that the shop was making money, he and the black ox had managed to earn some, hiding it in the backyard.
"Hehe, that's great." Sun Kaiyue smiled.
Mr. Sun Kaiyue once had a son who unfortunately died while seeking immortality in the Ningyun Mountain Range, and had been living alone all these years. However, since Chen Xun came to the shop, Mr. Sun Kaiyue’s face had brightened up considerably.
Chen Xun's speed and quality of work were much higher than those of other workers in the various smitheries in the city. Word spread quickly, and many people came to the shop, asking for custom ironware. When they left, their eyes were filled with satisfaction.
"Chen Xun!"
A loud shout came from the street, and a burly man with two others walked towards them, carrying a long knife.
"Zhang Ge is here."
Chen Xun greeted them with a smile. "What is that you want forged, Zhang Ge?"
Zhang Ge’s full name was Zhang Jiang. He was the senior disciple of a martial sect, known for his boldness. He often visited the smithery with his fellow disciples.
Zhang Jiang approached, shouting, "I need a hundred big knives. Can you do that for me?"
A substantial order! Chen Xun's eyes lit up as he continued forging. "Of course, of course. When do you need them, Zhang Ge?"
"Within two months. But if you have them ready in one month, I'll pay extra." Zhang Jiang grinned.
“You're being too polite, Zhang Ge. I'll have them ready for you within a month. No need for extra payment."
Chen Xun looked playfully at Zhang Jiang; they acted like brothers. "Come pick them up at the same time next month."
"Excellent! See that? That’s how you conduct business."
Zhang Jiang exclaimed and glanced at the two people behind him. They nodded in agreement; people in the martial circle liked dealing with someone like Chen Xun.
"Chen Xun, make sure that big black ox of yours doesn't end up on someone’s plate. Such intelligent old animals are hard to come by."
"This ox is my family's ancestral heritage. It won't be eaten," Chen Xun quickly reassured.
"Alright then, I'm off. If anyone dares to cause trouble in the smithery, inform Zhang Ge." Zhang Jiang laughed heartily and turned his gaze to the big black ox behind them. "Black ox, see you later, farewell from Zhang Ge."
"Moo!"
The animal turned its head and gave a moo in response.
"Hahaha..."
Raising his hand and waving, Chen Xun bid them farewell as they left the shop.
