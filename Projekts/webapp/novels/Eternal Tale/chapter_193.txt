"Who is in charge of the Five Elements Sect now?" Chen Xun's mood was quite sour as he glanced toward the Ji family members trembling in the backyard.
"Ancestor, the Sect Leader, and others have gone to the Northern Territory and have not yet returned." A Golden Core stage cultivator stepped forward, showing great respect. "I am currently acting as the Sect Leader."
However, he was nervous inside, wondering why the Ancestor seemed displeased. The Five Elements Sect had never mistreated the Ji family.
Chen Xun calmed himself, then looked at the disciples from each peak and said, "The younger generation is promising. Cultivate diligently and do not slack off."
"We will heed the Ancestor's teachings!"
"We will heed the Ancestor's teachings!"
All the disciples were extremely excited, each feeling as though they were being personally watched. With the Ancestor here, how could the Five Elements Sect not flourish?
"Liu family, Shi family, Ji family, and you four, come to the Sect Leader's Hall."
After speaking, Chen Xun headed toward the main peak. A deep snort from the big black ox behind him caused a slight tremor in the ground.
"Yes, Ancestor," the four Golden Core stage cultivators responded with great joy.
The members of the Shi and Liu families, standing at the other end of the sky, were both flattered and shocked, not expecting that their ancestors truly had connections with the Ancestor.
Half a day later. In the Sect Leader's Hall, Chen Xun sat on the main seat atop the steps, looking down below.
The big black ox stood in front of Chen Xun, its eyes fixed on Ji Dingren and Ji Yan, who were kneeling in the center of the hall.
The four Golden Core stage cultivators behind them looked terrified, bowing in respect. It seemed as though the Five Elements Sect had done something wrong.
The Liu and Shi family members, however, sat upright, having never done anything to tarnish the Ancestor's reputation.
The two family heads quietly sneered. The Ji family had relied on their relationship with the Ancestor to do many shady things within the Five Elements Sect.
Several young juniors stood behind the side seats, their eyes filled with confusion, not understanding the grudges of the older generation.
"This matter is not the fault of the Five Elements Sect; I was unclear in my instructions back then." Chen Xun sighed lightly, lamenting that human nature is unpredictable, especially after gaining power. "Investigate this matter thoroughly, and then expel them from the Five Elements Sect, leaving them to their fate."
"Ancestor, please don't! Ancestor!" Ji Dingren wept bitterly, unwilling to fall from grace. "We did not do this!"
Ji Yan trembled all over, prostrating himself on the ground. The pressure within the hall was unbearable for a mere mortal like him, leaving him speechless.
"If I were to take action, you would already be dead," Chen Xun's voice grew colder. "Return to the mortal world and do what you are supposed to do."
As soon as he finished speaking, a faint killing intent filled the hall. Everyone shivered, their eyes filled with even greater reverence.
Anyone who could cultivate the Nascent Soul stage could not be a benevolent person, and even one's Ancestor should never be offended.
The four Golden Core stage cultivators bowed their heads, already understanding the Ancestor's intention. A hint of killing intent flashed in their eyes.
It seemed that the Ancestor had not returned to handle this matter and would not stay long. Such an investigation was naturally left to them.
Reading the situation was always a necessary skill for a cultivator.
"After the investigation, keep the true members of the Ji family and teach them well. Do not show leniency because of my presence; be even stricter." Chen Xun's eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at the Liu and Shi family members. "You are all descendants of my old acquaintances. Do not disappoint me."
Everyone stood up and bowed deeply, full of respect. "We will remember the Ancestor's words in our hearts."
"You six, stay. The rest may leave." Chen Xun glanced at the juniors, smiling softly. He understood their thoughts and acknowledged them.
"Yes, Ancestor."
The juniors were thrilled. This was the Ancestor's power, and they couldn't help but aspire to be like him, standing tall before others.
The big black ox, in a foul mood, waved its hoof, sending the two Ji family members flying out of the hall, crashing heavily onto the ground, and coughing up blood.
They were then dragged away by the enforcement cultivators outside the hall, who looked very displeased.
It turned out that this group of Ji family outsiders had been throwing their weight around in the Five Elements Sect, but the Ancestor never regarded them as anything important.
Now, only the four Golden Core-stage cultivators who manage the Five Elements Sect and the heads of the Liu and Shi families remained in the hall.
"I have something precious to entrust to you. Do not let it spread beyond this room," Chen Xun said, producing six storage bags. "You have all risen to prominence on the path of cultivation, so I won't say much more."
With a wave of his hand, the storage bags landed in the hands of the six individuals.
Instinctively, they used their spiritual senses to inspect the contents, and their expressions changed dramatically—inside were extraordinarily rare spirit pills and medicinal herbs!
After a moment, their expressions returned to normal. They solemnly cupped their hands and said, "We understand."
With these items, the Five Elements Sect could quietly rise in power, but they knew well not to boast about it. The Ancestor's intentions were clear.
Chen Xun smiled and nodded, pleased with their understanding. They were seasoned individuals, making communication straightforward.
"Moo!" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, still in a bad mood.
"Go ahead and check," Chen Xun nodded, understanding its meaning. "It should be in the backyard of the Ji residence."
The big black ox grinned and disappeared from the hall. It wanted to find the true descendants of Senior Brother Ji, not those distant relatives who were merely taking advantage of the connection.
"I may take a few juniors from the Five Elements Sect to personally teach."
"Ancestor, that would be a great honor! Please feel free to choose."
"Ancestor, there may be unrest in the Northern Territory. The Sect Leader and others might face great danger. If some juniors could accompany you, our Five Elements Sect's legacy would be ensured."
"Ancestor, we will not speak of this to anyone and will guard the Five Elements Sect diligently!"
The six men stood in the hall, bowing with their joy, now replaced by serious discussions about the future of the Five Elements Sect.
"The cultivation world may soon face significant upheaval. The Nascent Soul-stage cultivators who stayed behind have already headed to the Northern Territory," Chen Xun nodded heavily. "I will have the old ox set up a formation to isolate us from the outside world. If a great disaster occurs, these resources will ensure the survival of the Five Elements Sect."
The six exchanged glances, then looked at Chen Xun together, saying, "Ancestor, we will not let you down!"
"Good, very good," Chen Xun's eyes gleamed as he repeated, "This is the Five Elements Sect I want to see."
The six men bowed deeply, their hearts filled with ambition. With such an Ancestor, how could the Five Elements Sect not thrive? Even if it cost them their lives, they were determined to protect the Sect.
Half a month later. A thunderous roar echoed, shaking the earth, and all the disciples of the Five Elements Sect felt a deep tremor.
The four Golden Core cultivators stood respectfully at the peak, bowing as the Ox Ancestor set up the formation with immense power.
The day before, Chen Xun had descended into the earth and buried numerous Crane Spirit Trees, which had been growing for tens of thousands of years, deep beneath the Five Elements Sect.
These trees were now releasing rich spiritual energy, waiting for time to work their magic.
"Farewell, Ancestor! Farewell, Ox Ancestor!"
"Farewell, Ancestor! Farewell, Ox Ancestor!"
Loud farewells echoed from all directions of the Yuzhu Mountain Range as the two Ancestors prepared to roam the world once more.
At this moment, a flying boat had already risen from the mountains, its grade indiscernible.
But apart from those six, the other disciples did not know that three very young cultivators were also standing on the flying boat.
They were overwhelmed with a mix of nervousness and excitement, unsure of their destination.
One was named Liu Han, a fifteen-year-old girl with two small braids and clear eyes at the sixth level of the Qi Refinement stage, possessing three spiritual roots.
Another was named Shi Wujun, a thirteen-year-old boy with a handsome appearance, at the fifth level of the Qi Refinement stage, possessing two spiritual roots.
The last was named Ji Zhao, a fourteen-year-old boy with a resolute face but a somber expression. He had no cultivation yet and was born with five mixed spiritual roots.
**Buzz—**
**Buzz—**
The flying boat suddenly accelerated, scattering the clouds as it soared, the farewell voices becoming inaudible.
The three stood at the center of the boat, faces flushed with excitement and anxiety, as they looked toward the figure of one man and one ox standing at the front—the true Nascent Soul-stage grand cultivators of the world of cultivation...
