Chi Buzi's vision darkened for a few moments before a dimly lit secret chamber appeared, cold and icy, with one or two flickers of white mana light.
This is... a cave dwelling?
Chi Buzi's gaze shifted, noticing the floor, intricately patterned, with osmanthus trees bearing ethereal white flowers that were fragrant yet chilling.
What is this... it looks somewhat like the Moon Glazed Tree, our sect's Purple Mansion Realm spirit root.
Given that this was the place where Supreme Yin Moonlight was obtained, some anomalies were expected. Chi Buzi quickly looked away, then saw a stone platform ahead which was shrouded in a white mist, exuding an aura of mystery.
This is…
Chi Buzi's heart stirred, but then he heard rustling noises. Golden and white osmanthus flowers fell, their golden stamens and pleasant fragrance particularly striking in the misty moonlight.
Rustle, rustle…
Several lively, adorable toads and rabbits hopped out from the dark corners, trampling on the fallen osmanthus petals.
Li Yuanjiao finally straightened up, allowing Buzi to see what was on the platform.
Suspended on the stone platform was a small grayish-green sphere, inscribed with ancient and profound runes. Suddenly, a pair of eyes appeared on it.
They were gentle yet indifferent and majestic.
On the peak of Mount Lijing, Chi Buzi's hand, which was hidden in his sleeve and performing the hand seals of his spell, began to tremble violently. Tears of blood streamed from his eyes that were closed tightly, trailing down his cheeks and making him look especially terrifying.
Drip, drop.
Two droplets of blood tears fell to the stone floor, shattering two bricks, then rolled like beads, producing crisp, echoing sounds.
Buzi's arrival was too sudden, a consequence of his reckless pursuit of Supreme Yin Moonlight for Li Chejing's Dao foundation years ago.
Although Si Yuanbai had claimed to have obtained the moonlight himself to protect the Li Family, deceiving the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, no one had anticipated that the matter would resurface years later. Eventually, some greedy individuals took a chance and personally visited the Li Family.
"I guess there's no running away this time…"
The immortal mirror had not regained its full power, but its inherent rank was exceedingly high. Once it was used for calculations, it was equivalent to predicting the fate of those above the Dao Embryo Realm. Lu Jiangxian had borrowed its power back then and was well aware of its capabilities.
Whether it was Master Monk Minghui or Maha Jinlian, they were merely following Li Qinghong's trail. When Lu Jiangxian directed them to the mirror, they immediately suffered significant losses.
The talisman seed of the mirror was even more domineering. Those in the Li Family who bore the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed had their souls, fates, and cultivation all linked to it. As long as Lu Jiangxian willed it, no one could touch them.
Now, with Buzi searching Li Yuanjiao's soul, he should have found nothing. Seeing Buzi's persistence, Lu Jiangxian grew increasingly fearful. If Li Yuanjiao's soul search failed, it would only raise more suspicion and complicate the situation. Ultimately, he might be exposed.
The Supreme Yin Profound Light was only at the Foundation Establishment Realm, but it was powerful enough to instantly kill a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator or even threaten a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. However, Chi Buzi was not a stationary target and could escape into the Great Void, making it impossible to hit him.
Seeing Buzi initiate the soul search and about to reach the mirror, Lu Jiangxian gritted his teeth and thought to himself, I might as well use the talisman seed as a bridge and connect to Chi Buzi's spell immediately.
Although Lu Jiangxian was not skilled in soul-searching techniques, his proficiency in shamanic talisman had grown considerably over the years. Moonlight surged as it connected to fate, and the immortal mirror lit up, forcefully crashing into Chi Buzi's sea of consciousness.
Although I have not recovered, my divine sense far exceeds ordinary spiritual senses! Only by using this technique to counterattack can I hope for a chance at survival…!
————
Li Yuanjiao's consciousness drifted in a haze for a long time before suddenly clearing. A cool sensation rose from his Qihai acupoint, and he snapped his eyes open. Before him was Chi Buzi's hand, pressed against his forehead.
All around him was pitch-black and gloomy, the corners shrouded in darkness, and the atmosphere was oppressive. It was the time of day when baleful qi was at its peak.
The sky had already darkened, indicating that nearly two hours had passed. The blood-red setting sun, accompanied by dark red clouds, flowed on the horizon, signaling an ominous portent.
He glanced around and saw that the ground was covered with glittering red jade beads, lying quietly and reflecting dazzling colors in the dim light, creating a rather beautiful scene.
"Daoist Master..?" Li Yuanjiao called out cautiously, unsure of what Chi Buzi had done to him with his divine ability. He bowed his head in silence.
I am still alive… Chi Buzi must not have discovered anything.
Chi Buzi gave no response.
A sense of unease rose within Li Yuanjiao. After a long moment, he began to step back slowly. Chi Buzi remained silent, his sleeve hanging limply. When Li Yuanjiao finally looked up, he saw that the Daoist Master's face was grim, and his eyes were tightly shut.
The darkened twilight illuminated Chi Buzi's face, revealing two streams of blood tears. The sight struck Li Yuanjiao like a thunderclap, leaving his mind blank.
Chi Buzi! What is this..?!
Drip, drip…
Blood flowed down continuously Chi Buzi's cheeks, dripping from his chin as two blood beads hit the ground, transforming instantly into sparkling red jade beads. They collided with the ones on the ground, creating a series of crisp clinking sounds.
Li Yuanjiao now understood how the jade beads had come to be. Though he felt somewhat relieved, he was also horrified and took a step back. Chi Buzi remained motionless like a statue in the dim twilight.
Li Yuanjiao cautiously extended his spiritual sense to scan Chi Buzi, only to find nothing but an empty shell where the previous oppressive aura had been.
The jade bottle containing the talisman pill had fallen from Chi Buzi's sleeve and shattered on the ground. The pill rolled out and settled in a crack between the bricks.
Silently, Li Yuanjiao moved out of the courtyard. His father, Li Xuanxuan, lay stiffly on the ground. Li Yuanjiao checked his breathing, which was steady and long, then spotted a bloody wound on his head, indicating that he had been knocked unconscious.
Li Yuanjiao immediately took to the air, his spiritual sense sweeping the area. The two clan guards outside the courtyard seemed to have been affected by a spell and were sound asleep, snoring loudly.
Seeing that some were beginning to stir, Li Yuanjiao hurried back into the courtyard. He closed the gate hurriedly and helped Li Xuanxuan to his feet, using a spell to awaken him.
Li Xuanxuan gradually regained consciousness, groggy and bewildered. Upon seeing Li Yuanjiao, he asked in shock, "Where is the Daoist Master?!"
Li Yuanjiao gave a bitter laugh, shook his head, and helped Li Xuanxuan up to his feet. Opening the courtyard gate, he saw the two clan guards standing straight, showing no signs of their earlier slumber.
"Go fetch Qinghong and Yuanping!" Li Yuanjiao ordered.
After the guards left, Li Yuanjiao led Li Xuanxuan to the backyard.
The sky grew darker, and Chi Buzi remained standing there, tears of blood continually dripping from his stoic face. Li Xuanxuan felt dizzy at the sight. The red jade beads covering the ground gleamed brightly.
"Jiao'er…"
Li Xuanxuan trembled as he scanned Chi Buzi with his spiritual sense. The man stood like a jade pillar, and it was hard to believe what he saw. He checked repeatedly.
The colorful light of Chi Buzi's divine ability and overwhelming aura had vanished. The oppressive presence that once traversed the Great Void was gone, leaving only his thin green robe on his jade-like body.
Chi Buzi's face showed slight pain, but still, the bloody tears continued flowing.
"…Is he dead? …Is he really dead?"
Li Xuanxuan's face turned pale, and he staggered back a few steps, filled not with relief or satisfaction, but with trembling fear.
"The Azure Pond Sect… how many years has it been since a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator was killed…"
