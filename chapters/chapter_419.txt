Located in the desert, the street of Smoke Valley Market was paved with sandstone. After walking for a bit, Chen Donghe and Li Yuanjiao heard the calls of merchants hawking their wares. As they raised their gaze, a sea of people stretched before them.
During their walk, Li Yuanjiao shared the news of Li Xuanfeng's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm with Chen Donghe, who looked slightly better upon hearing it, though his tone suggested that he had already expected this.
"Xuanfeng has always been extraordinary since young. He's the most talented among all his brothers, so his achievement was to be expected," Chen Donghe had remarked simply.
After walking a little more, Chen Donghe had pretty much returned to his usual self. He pointed at the bustling crowd and explained, "Despite the barrenness of Smoke Valley Desert, it is rich in spirit resources and ores. Cultivators from all directions flock here, making the number of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators here far surpass those at Cloud Crowned Peak."
He looked around cautiously, his voice diminishing to a whisper before shifting to mana transmission.
"Ultimately, it's due to the Golden Feather Sect's lax control over the temples and their handling of rogue cultivators. This balance allows many lower-ranked cultivators to thrive peacefully here, their numbers dwarfing those at Azure Pond."
Li Yuanjiao observed the crowd around them and nodded in agreement. "The Azure Pond Sect has the largest number of Purple Mansion, Foundation Establishment, and Qi cultivators though. It sees less return from the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators than it could gain from regular annexations and purges… This also ensures that the incapable naturally yield to the more capable and talented. Thus, valuable resources aren't squandered on mediocrity."
After serving the Azure Pond Sect for such a long time now, the Li Family had naturally developed deep connections and insights over the years. Li Yuanjiao elaborated, "The many Embryonic Breathing Realm families in the region can only cultivate Spirit Paddies and must contend with others… They will never be able to compete with Foundation Establishment prestigious clans with high-ranking cultivators in their ranks."
His gaze lingered on the market stalls briefly as he sighed.
"Yet, I must admit that the Azure Pond Sect's systems and strategies are more ruthless and sophisticated, enabling them to evolve from a minor sect on Mount Azure Pond to the formidable entity that they are today."
Chen Donghe fell silent. The atmosphere grew somber, prompting them to shift the conversation. Li Yuanjiao furrowed his brow.
"Uncle Donghe, I brought a bottle of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi with me. It's a common item, yet I've seen none for sale. Why is that?" he asked.
Chen Donghe pointed at the pervasive yellow sand and explained, "Minor Pure Spiritual Qi can only be collected from mountains and forests, which are absent in the desert. The people have found various ways to resolve this issue since ancient times. Historically, the locals have devised various alternatives… Nowadays, most have adopted Minor Quicksand Qi as a substitute. Minor Pure Spiritual Qi is now rarely seen and not worth much."
Chen Donghe's explanation enlightened Li Yuanjiao. The two then searched for a shop and traded the Azure Blades for fifty Spirit Stones.
Although the Azure Blades were mid-quality Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts, it was unfortunate that the curved dual blades were rarely seen. After several rounds of negotiation, it managed to only fetch a moderate price.
Li Yuanjiao accepted the Spirit Stones with a sigh of relief.
No wonder most Qi Cultivators wield Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts… Fifty Spirit Stones will take an ordinary Qi Cultivator over ten years to save by just gathering qi without active cultivation. If they are actively cultivating, they will also need to buy supplies and rations, which can easily triple or quadruple this period… That's about forty years of savings for a single dharma artifact. How many such forty-year spans does one have in a lifetime?!
He then retrieved a devil cultivator's sledgehammer that he had gotten from Li Qinghong from his storage pouch. This inferior Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact was worth only thirty Spirit Stones. After selling the remainder of the Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts, including Li Qinghong's nine Spirit Stones, Li Yuanjiao managed to amass nearly a total of a hundred Spirit Stones.
With Minor Pure Spiritual Qi being both cheap and rare here, Li Yuanjiao decided to keep it for now. Chen Donghe pushed six Spirit Stones into Li Yuanjiao's hands, rounding out the majority of the sum, leaving just over a dozen Spirit Stones unaccounted for.
Xizhi's letter mentioned that Yuan Tuan could provide some Spirit Stones, but relying on a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's favors for just a few stones really isn't worth it.
Having gathered all their items, the two exited the market and flew across the vast desert. Li Yuanjiao hesitated slightly before asking Chen Donghe, "Is there a way to earn Spirit Stones in the desert?"
Chen Donghe pondered briefly before replying, "There are ways, but most would take years, and it's unlikely you could gather more than ten Spirit Stones."
Upon hearing that, Li Yuanjiao could only perish this train of thought. He handed over the few pills in his possession to Chen Donghe, then asked, "Uncle Donghe, how's the progress with the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi?"
"It's about 80% ready," Chen Donghe replied as he pulled a jade bottle from his storage pouch and added, "It'll be ready in another year and a half!"
"Good," Li Yuanjiao acknowledged with a nod of approval, "I'll head back to the clan first. Take care, Uncle Donghe… After some time, I will come find you again."
After exchanging a few parting words and promising to pay respects to Li Tongya on Chen Donghe's behalf, Li Yuanjiao rode away on the wind.
The Yu Family of Linghai Prefecture had been a prominent clan for generations. Its descendants pledged allegiance to various immortal peaks within the Azure Pond Sect, often competing fiercely among themselves for power and influence.
In the abandoned city, streets and alleys lay dry and deserted, save for the faint sounds of conversation emanating from the great hall at the city's highest point. Here, a few of the Yu Family's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators stood in an awkward line.
Historically, the heads of these family branches rarely met, communicating instead through messengers even for internal discussions. Yet this time, they found themselves together in this desolate city, their expressions both a mixture of respect and tension. They were all clad in distinct attire.
At the end of the hall sat a black-robed monk, his belly protruding as if he were six months pregnant. His face, gleaming with grease, shifted between broad grins and labored gasps for breath.
"Are you satisfied, Master Monk?" asked the eldest of the Yu Family, stepping forward with a smile.
"Absolutely! I have no complaints! Your family has always been the most generous… offering up sixteen thousand souls! Truly, the Yu Family possesses the greatest wisdom in not clinging to mortal coils," Murong Xia responded with a huge grin.
"Hahaha! I'm glad to hear that, Master Monk!"
The old master of the Yu Family laughed as a gust of wind swept through the empty streets, a sense of satisfaction welling within him.
This one is about to become a Maha! Without the exchange of interests between the immortals and the Buddhists, how could the Yu Family have ever connected with such a powerful figure? Now is the perfect opportunity to earn his favor before he attains the Maha status!
With a broad, obliging smile, he continued with forced sweetness, "Is this city sufficient for you, Master Monk? If not, I can find more people of great virtue and wash them well before sending them into your belly for a good time!"
The monk, half reclining on a grand golden seat, hummed a few notes. His protruding belly was exposed, and it was visibly marked with blue and purple veins.
He simply laughed off the offer.
"No need… no need! I've already gathered 106,756 people… Any more, and they might rupture my blessed land."
He winced, grappling with the discomfort in his belly briefly. After several labored breaths, he added with a broad grin, "Since embracing the Virtuous Benevolence Zen Dao, I've abandoned The Merciful One's feeble ways… Now, having realized the way, I will soon ascend to Maha! Then, I shall reclaim the cultivation of my previous lives and reach even greater heights!"
