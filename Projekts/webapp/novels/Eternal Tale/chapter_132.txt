"Old ox, I've made a hundred-year plan." Chen Xun took out a booklet and placed it in front of the big black ox. "Take a look and see if there's anything to add."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded and stared blankly at it, its head still being held by his hand. "Moo moo!" The big black ox seemed a bit anxious and quickly began to write and add to it.
They should also find out what was auctioned at those two events. Their knowledge should also count towards their cultivation.
Chen Xun suddenly realized this and quickly added it. There would always be oversights.
At this moment, the warm sunlight spread down, filtering through the dense leaves and casting golden spots of light on the two figures.
They seemed to be writing furiously, almost quarreling. The clear stream reflected the blue sky and white clouds.
Silently, they added a point of immortality to their defense for the year.
The next day, the plan began!
Firstly, they would infinitely enhance their cultivation. Chen Xun and the big black ox announced the formal closure of their cave and ceased all non-essential activities.
The big black ox cultivated spiritual herbs, while Chen Xun practiced alchemy. Afterwards, they would take the Five Elements Pills together to begin their cultivation.
The hustle and bustle inside and outside the cave suddenly became still, only the sound of the wind and the flowing stream remained.
Seasons changed, occasional heavy snow covered the earth, and the sky and earth seemed to merge into one.
The towering crane spirit trees around them still stood firm, displaying remarkably robust vitality. Although common, upon closer inspection, they could be considered the top unique trees in the cultivation world.
The surroundings were still concealed by formations, without a sound, tranquil, and harmonious.
However, occasionally, the terrifying spiritual energy fluctuations from inside the cave would cause the crane spirit trees to shed countless yellow leaves.
There were also many cultivators who had not returned from Qin Immortal Mountain. They must have exchanged cultivation insights during their exploration of the mysterious realm and fell into demonic cultivation, resulting in their deaths.
Yu Xu City still retained the scene of prosperity in the cultivation world, with powerful cultivators waving tens of thousands of spirit stones, and minor cultivators traveling for days for just a few spirit stones.
The sky remained the same sky, but people were no longer the same people.
As time flowed by, when looking back suddenly, only Chen Xun and the big black ox remained, accompanying each other, never leaving each other's side. A hundred years had passed.
A person and an ox slowly walked out of the cave, surrounded by spiritual energy, with dust flying around them as if clearing the way. Their momentum was overwhelming.
Their spiritual consciousness instantly filled the inside and outside of the cave, every change in every place was remembered, and they were inspecting any suspicious areas.
"Heh heh."
"Moo~"
Their eyes were cold, emitting a low laugh with every step, each step as if stepping on the pulse of the earth.
There were even rainbow lights flashing around them, accompanied by rumbling sounds, no cultivator dared to approach and try the terrifying and heavy spiritual energy.
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged a tacit glance, the corners of their mouths gradually lifting.
Finally, after the accumulation of countless spiritual herbs and pills, they broke through. The resources consumed were enough to make a major sect kneel, cry out that they couldn't afford it, and ask them to leave.
Mid-Golden Core stage cultivators!
Their physique, spiritual energy, and spiritual consciousness had all ascended a level, the changes immersing them as if it were the most wonderful thing in the world.
This was something that even the system's upgrades couldn't achieve. The marvelous power of heaven and earth was vast and boundless; even eternal beings couldn't fathom it.
And the Five Elements Pills had indeed reached their limit, unable to further enhance their cultivation.
But the Golden Cores in their bodies had all grown in a circle and were quite full, no longer giving off a withered and dim feeling.
"Old ox, take a few days' rest, and let's make another hundred-year plan." Chen Xun's eyes were calm; everything was just a matter of course. "Let's go down the mountain and buy two Red Lightning Wolves!"
"Moo?!"
"I'm feeling happy today!"
"Moo~~"
"Hahaha..."
From outside the cave came wildly arrogant laughter and the sound of high-pitched ox calls. Their figures gradually disappeared from the cave, descending the mountain.
The immortal points accumulated over the past century have been added to defense, speed, and the essence of all things.
Their current points are: Strength 90, Speed 139 (90), Essence of All Things 140 (90), Spiritual Energy 140 (90), Defense 140 (90).
However, they missed the perfect opportunity of this hundred-year event, as after buying meat, they ran to inquire about the auction items.
Unexpectedly, there was an eight-hundred-year-old Yu Chen Grass available. Upon hearing this, they lamented and prepared to return to perform rituals in disappointment, shouting curses at the Gods and Buddhas.
Though, life is never perfect; perhaps a slight regret can make the cultivation life more enjoyable.
On their way back, they also renewed the lease for their cave for another two hundred years.
They were greeted by a stranger, who sincerely said only one sentence in the end: "Hope fellow Daoists will come again next time."
Qin Immortal Mountain, Yellow-ranked cave, night.
After a sumptuous meal, Chen Xun and the big black ox sat under the starry sky and began discussing their future again.
The Yuan Chen Ginseng they had cultivated was already endless for generations, only lacking the Yu Chen Grass and the Night White Mushroom.
"But, Old Ox, we don't need to rush." Chen Xun chuckled and scooped up some stream water, shimmering in the moonlight. "My axe skills and your formations. Our personal magic weapons and the strategy to earn spirit stones all need to be started in the next hundred years. In the end, we just need to participate in that auction."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox smiled; it had never been in a hurry, just following its big brother.
It also played with the stream water with a hoof, eyes thoughtful, and glanced at the Crane Spirit Tree inadvertently.
Chen Xun had mentioned wanting to refine the alchemy furnace into a personal magic weapon, and he actually wanted to refine the formation flag into a personal magic weapon as well, as a main controller.
"What's wrong, Old Ox?" Chen Xun also glanced at the Crane Spirit Tree.
"Moo moo!" The big black ox suddenly danced with excitement, mooing crazily.
"You want to refine a set of formation flags into a personal magic weapon? And you want to use the Crane Spirit Tree?" Chen Xun shook his head and laughed heartily, "Have you forgotten that formation flags require special materials for refinement? They are filled with..."
"Moo?!" The big black ox suddenly got excited and ran to Chen Xun's side.
At this point, a light flashed in Chen Xun's mind, and his pupils contracted: "Spiritual Qi... only by communicating with the heavens and the earth in this way, can we achieve the effect of the formation."
He slowly looked towards the Crane Spirit Tree; this wood was indeed a spiritual tree with innate Spiritual Qi.
But in the cultivation world, most of the Crane Spirit Trees were of ordinary age, too fragile to be used as materials for refining tools.
However, Chen Xun and the big black ox knew that this tree had reached a certain age; its terrifying vitality and hardness were unparalleled.
And for such a Crane Spirit Tree to grow to such an age, it must be in an extremely terrifying place of spiritual Qi accumulation, which simply does not exist in reality.
"Okay, Old Ox, I'll try it later and help you refine a set." Chen Xun looked pensive, "Once we have enough spirit stones, we'll go buy those refining books and materials for formations."
"Moo~~~" The big black ox kept rubbing against Chen Xun, almost ecstatic.
"With me around, Old Ox, you're in good hands!" Chen Xun snorted coldly, his eyes showing disdain for the world, "I'd like to see who dares to disrespect me. In the future, I'll have to visit him and reason with him."
"Moo!!"
The big black ox once again admired Chen Xun, prostrating itself by the creek, bathing in incense, and stepping forward to worship...
Bang!
A silver light flashed by, and a fist bigger than a sandbag struck, flipping the big black ox over and floating away with the stream, its eyes filled with sparkling stars.
