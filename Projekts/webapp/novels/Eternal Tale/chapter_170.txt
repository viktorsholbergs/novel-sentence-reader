In the midst of the radiant glow, Chen Xun's gaze appeared lost, as if he couldn't quite grasp the monumental changes occurring within him.
This was a new realm altogether. Achieving the Nascent Soul stage utterly overturned his entire perspective on the cultivation world, incomparable to the Golden Core stage.
"The Nascent Soul is like nurturing a new life within oneself; the Primordial Spirit materializes, connecting with the heavens and earth." Chen Xun continued to refine himself, the enormous figure of light on his back flickering. "Even if the physical body is destroyed, the Nascent Soul can escape."
He murmured to himself, a flash of lightning glinting in his eyes. The colossal figure of light suddenly wavered, beginning to split.
Suddenly!
The light figure dissolved into five-colored radiance, disappearing into the heavens and earth. Above Chen Xun's head, five ethereal figures appeared, sitting cross-legged, absorbing the essence of the five elements from their surroundings.
They resembled infants, sacred and transcendent, shrouded in a halo of light, their faces rosy and serene.
Their faces bore a striking resemblance to Chen Xun, like five miniature versions of him.
"Is this the legendary divine ability..." Chen Xun's expression turned peculiar, but he was still immersed in the experience. "To comprehend the art of splitting the Nascent Soul without a teacher! Doesn't that mean I now have five lives?"
As he spoke, three of the Nascent Soul figures merged back into his body, and a powerful, indescribable force surged forth from within him. The constraints of the system's enhancement points were finally broken, allowing him to continue enhancing.
Their current immortal points were: Strength 140, Speed 140, Essence of All Things 140, Spiritual Energy 140, Defense 140.
Chen Xun's expression shifted as he carefully sensed the rising power within him, beginning a true all-encompassing elevation.
In the distance.
"Moo~~" The big black ox snorted in astonishment, its eyes wide open, staring at Chen Xun without blinking.
A massive wave of shock surged in its heart!
Now, with lightning flashing across his body and large strands of black hair turning silver, Chen Xun seemed like a completely different person.
Even from such a distance, the ox could sense the terrifying might emanating from him, entirely different from the breakthrough from the Foundation Establishment stage to the Golden Core stage.
"Old Ox, where the hell are you?!"
A thunderous, cursing voice echoed like rolling thunder, snapping Chen Xun completely out of his trance as he looked around for the ox.
"Moo!!" The big black ox excitedly called out, transforming into a streak of light.
The tribulation site was filled with large pits of flowing sand; the scent of scorched earth was thick in the air, and the colorful radiance completely faded.
Chen Xun had regained his original appearance; his divine might was subdued, and the five Nascent Souls sitting within his body appeared quite tiny.
He looked overjoyed, glancing at the approaching big black ox, hugging it tightly: "Old Ox, how about that, hahaha!"
"Moo moo~~!" The big black ox happily broke free from Chen Xun, running in circles around him.
Chen Xun laughed heartily, his eyes shining brightly as he watched the circling big black ox, wanting to share this immense joy with his brother.
"Old Ox, let's find another place."
"Moo~"
The big black ox grinned and came over to nuzzle him again.
Chen Xun looked around the vast land, feeling no arrogance, as a greenish light appeared in his hand, which he gently waved.
**Boom...**
Where the spiritual energy passed, it exploded like thunder in the plains, and the entire sandy sea became wild, with sand spiraling up to a hundred feet high, gradually burying all traces.
As a Nascent Soul Patriarch, every gesture carried immense power, capable of destroying the surroundings, with no one daring to oppose.
"Moo!!" The big black ox marveled at Chen Xun, utterly impressed.
"Hehe, this is just one-tenth of my strength." Chen Xun said, holding the ox's head and raising his head high, "Old Ox, let's go; I'll tell you about the taboos of the tribulation."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox still looked shocked, staring blankly at Chen Xun.
They turned into a streak of rainbow light, treading through the sky, driving away the strong winds around them.
"Old Ox, the power of the heavenly tribulation is not frightening; what concerns me is the Heart Tribulation."
"Moo~"
"What would you do if you saw me... die in front of you?"
"Moo? Moo moo moo?!!"
The big black ox let out a terrified cry, not understanding why Chen Xun would say such a thing. It would surely kill itself without hesitation if that happened.
"But this Heart Tribulation is terrifying because it makes you lose yourself in it." Chen Xun's face was serious, reminding the ox with each word, "So remember to stay true to yourself. It's all fake!"
"Moo~" The big black ox's pupils trembled. Even knowing it was fake, it still found it hard to accept.
"Next, I'll tell you about the ten thousand ways I might unexpectedly die."
"Moo!" The big black ox roared angrily, not wanting to listen.
"You must listen." Chen Xun frowned and rarely scolded the big black ox, "Once we get through this hurdle, we can live a great life."
The big black ox's eyes showed sorrow as it quietly nuzzled him. It knew that Chen Xun had not yet stabilized his Nascent Soul and had rushed over to help it almost immediately.
Chen Xun looked deeply at the big black ox, knowing it had a simple mind and could cause trouble during the Heart Tribulation.
"Old Ox, listen carefully. For instance, you might watch as I am killed by Senior Brother Ji..." Chen Xun began explaining various ways he could die and different accidents, his face solemn.
The big black ox listened in horror, trembling all over and struggling even with the hypothetical scenarios Chen Xun described.
They walked on air for three days and nights, with Chen Xun speaking non-stop and the big black ox's breathing growing heavier.
Another night fell.
The last rays of the sun faded, and the night sky descended like a velvet curtain in a theater.
They found a place to land, with Chen Xun looking more nervous than the big black ox.
The latter stood on all fours, looking up at Chen Xun with eyes full of sorrow, as if reminiscing about old friends.
**Boom!**
"Damn it, I'm not dead!" Chen Xun roared angrily, kicking the big black ox away. It felt like the ox was preparing to erect a tombstone for him.
"Moo!!"
The big black ox, half-buried in the ground from the kick, suddenly snapped back to reality. Right, big brother wasn't dead; it was all hypothetical.
"Old Ox, these thirteen Nascent Formation Pills are for you."
A medicine box floated in front of Chen Xun, and with a wave, it moved in front of the big black ox.
He had explained all the precautions and possible accidents. If the ox couldn't pass this tribulation, it would be a disgrace to him.
Chen Xun's eyes flashed with lightning, his aura becoming unknowingly oppressive.
"Moo moo!" The big black ox nodded solemnly, remembering every word Chen Xun said.
It would not disappoint him, and he wanted to continue walking this path alongside its big brother.
"Old Ox, breakthrough to Nascent Soul, and we'll find you a little cow!"
"Moo!"
The big black ox let out a long cry, emerging from the sandy sea, and took out all the incense burners from its storage bag, lighting each one.
In an instant, the big black ox sat down, mooing continuously, even bringing out the now-blank merit book.
It opened its mouth wide and took out the 'Five Qi Ink Spirit Flower' from its storage ring, scattering the petals everywhere.
Chen Xun's eyelids twitched wildly at this sight. The ox had more incense burners than he did—at least thirty—and had brought out all its belongings.
"Moo!!"
The big black ox's eyes were full of devotion, surrounded by rising blue smoke from the incense burners, shrouding its body in mist.
Chen Xun's body turned into a point of light, appearing far away, watching the big black ox from a distance.
**Rumble!**
Suddenly, a sense of foreboding arose. The sky and earth were filled with an indescribable killing aura as Chen Xun looked up.
The heavens changed color, the wind and clouds surged, and thunder rolled like crashing waves.
The heavenly tribulation was coming, and its target was the big black ox.
**Boom!**
A deafening sound echoed as thick lightning spread out in an instant, covering the area with crackling sounds.
