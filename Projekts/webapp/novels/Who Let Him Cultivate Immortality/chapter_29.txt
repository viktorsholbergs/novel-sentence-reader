Chapter 29: The Concept of the Ancient Great Era
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
“I’ve read your mission report. Using wisdom to eliminate a painted skin demon, you did a great job.”
Lu Yang felt joy in his heart; receiving praise from the eldest senior sister was not easy, and the trip to Taiping Village was worthwhile.
After briefly commenting, Yun Zhi thought of the implications behind the painted skin demon and her brows slightly furrowed.
“In the past hundred years, with the arrival of the great era, various hidden forces have become restless, ghosts and demons run rampant. Although the Great Xia Dynasty seems calm, countless disasters are hidden within. The dynasty, too proud to seek help from the five major immortal sects, keeps its troubles to itself.” Yun Zhi sighed lightly, her words not really meant for Lu Yang.
Lu Yang caught a term in his senior sister’s speech: “The arrival of the great era?”
He had never heard of this term, nor seen it in books.
Yun Zhi spoke ethereally, as if not of this world: “A hundred years ago, the Great Elder of Heaven’s Mysteries Sect emerged from his death meditation, spilling blood over Qing River, questioning the heavens with his life, and what he found out remains unknown.”
Heaven’s Mysteries Sect, known for predicting everything, emphasizes natural justice and karmic retribution. They were the ones who questioned the insurance proposed by the Luodi Commercial Chamber.
“The Great Elder then announced to the world, claiming the arrival of the great era, heralding the resplendence of ancient times in cultivating immortality.”
“Usually, it’s considered good if a single spiritual root disciple emerges from each generation of the five major sects. In your generation, there have been ancient barbarians, three single spiritual roots, and even rarer immortal bodies. I’ve heard that other sects have also recruited many geniuses not inferior to single spiritual roots in the past hundred years. From this, we can glimpse a corner of the ancient great era.”
Yun Zhi rarely curved her lips in a barely perceptible smile, seemingly mocking: “The ancient great era is said to be glorious, but in reality, it is extremely chaotic. The great era is also a troubled era, with various forces and interests intertwined. Demons and monsters scheme against each other, human hearts are unpredictable, and life and death are in the hands of fate. Countless innocents die before a great cultivator emerges, far less peaceful and stable than the present.”
Lu Yang felt his senior sister’s smile was very cold.
He had read descriptions of the ancient great era in books, where strength reigned supreme, and the victor was king, with no distinction between right and wrong. The human race was just one of the strong factions at that time, far from the dominant status it holds on the continent today.
Demons emerged, dragons and tigers fought, heroes roamed the world, building their reputation with blood and bones, resolutely killing, and countless great beings became legends admired by millions, unattainable goals for cultivators. It was truly exciting, making one wish to travel back to that era and show off their talent.
It was in such chaotic times that various heroes had the opportunity to emerge.
But seeing his senior sister’s expression, Lu Yang realized that the ancient great era was good for the talented, but a hellish nightmare for ordinary people.
Life was uncertain, with no guarantee of survival till dawn. A common skirmish among the upper echelons could reduce one’s own people to slaves and prisoners, subjected to enslavement and slaughter, with no stability whatsoever.
The descriptions of the ancient great era in books were grand because the authors themselves were high-level cultivators who yearned for those scenes.
From the perspective of ordinary people, the picture would be entirely different.
Lu Yang realized that since becoming a cultivator, he seemed to have forgotten that he was once a mortal.
That shouldn’t be the case.
Yun Zhi did not elaborate further on this topic, as it was too early for Lu Yang: “Do you have anything else to ask?”
“Well, senior sister, do you have any spells for traveling quickly?”
“Of course, but what do you need such spells for?”
The disciples of the Dao Seeking Sect had an agreement with the Luodi Commercial Chamber. When traveling, all expenses related to accommodation and transportation were charged to the Dao Seeking Sect’s account. Lu Yang didn’t even need to spend spirit stones to ride the flying boat. Why learn a travel spell?
Lu Yang scratched his head, rarely showing embarrassment: “It’s nothing, just want to learn, to save money for our Dao Seeking Sect.”
Yun Zhi didn’t doubt him: “You have this intention, and as your senior sister, I cannot disappoint you. You’ve just established your foundation, and there aren’t many spells you can use.”
Lu Yang chuckled and rubbed his hands together: “As long as there are some I can use.”
“Your cultivation over the past year has been seen by me, worthy of the name Sword Spirit Root. I have a flying sword technique here that allows you to ride a flying sword and travel freely across the world.”
“There are also teleportation spells, which refine your spiritual consciousness, allowing it to be strong enough to move your body and fly at will. The speed is not as fast as the flying sword technique, but it’s less strenuous and helps in battles.”
“Transformation spells are another option. Once mastered, you can transform into a bird and soar freely in the sky.”
“Little junior brother, which one will you choose?” Yun Zhi casually mentioned several spells for Lu Yang to choose from.
“…Well, are there any spells for traveling that don’t involve flying?”
Yun Zhi looked at Lu Yang with interest: “Oh? Why do you want a travel spell that doesn’t require flying?”
Lu Yang stammered, unable to articulate his thoughts.
Yun Zhi didn’t press further: “There are indeed such spells, but they require a high level of Taoist understanding and sufficient magical power. You might be learning them a bit too early.”
“It’s okay, I’ll give it a try. If it doesn’t work, then so be it.”
“This spell is called ‘Shrinking the Earth into Inches.’ It’s extremely difficult to master. Here’s the mantra. Once you’ve memorized it, I’ll start teaching you.”
Yun Zhi gracefully lifted her hand, effortlessly opened a space, and took out a golden piece of paper, neatly filled with elegant characters.
Lu Yang carefully took the golden paper, knowing its worth. He feared damaging it.
After Lu Yang left, Yun Zhi resumed her meditation. With a gust of cold wind, a hoarse and resentful voice echoed in her ear, chilling to the bone as if coming from the deepest abyss.
“My dear disciple, how much longer will you keep your master imprisoned here?”
The voice seemed to emerge from the depths of hell, causing shivers down the spine.
“The number of times I have taught you is few, but you’ve managed to cultivate to your current level. I am proud of you as your master.”
“They say ‘a day as your teacher, a lifetime as your father.’ You cannot neglect the kindness of your master’s teachings and imprison me here.”
“The Dao Seeking Sect has been without a master for ten years. You’ve been exercising the master’s rights on my behalf. Aren’t you afraid of gossip affecting your illustrious image as the eldest senior sister?”
“You accepted a disciple on my behalf, and even though he is a sword cultivation genius, I won’t delve into it.”
“But at least let your master out to meet my disciple. It’s absurd to have him worship my portrait instead of the real person. Won’t people laugh if this gets out?”
The voice contained a certain magic, stirring emotions and making one unconsciously want to believe and release the voice’s owner.
Yun Zhi, immersed in her cultivation, ignored it completely.
The aged voice, seeing Yun Zhi unmoved, turned its thousands of words into a long sigh, disappearing as if it never existed.
Yun Zhi remained focused in her meditation, unaffected by the disturbance.
