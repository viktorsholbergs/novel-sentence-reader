Having acquired the devastated Mount Huaqian, the Li Family's craftsmen and laborers who had been idle for years, finally found a place to unleash their skills.
The population surplus from various towns also found a new place to live, instantly revitalizing the area. A large number of craftsmen flooded into the ruins at the foot of Mount Huaqian, beginning construction and repairs.
The entire ebony mine fell within the Li Family's territory, still protected by the formation plates left by the Lu Family. However, without the Lu Family's cultivators meddling unnecessarily, there was no longer a need to support a group of idle people who did nothing but eat, drink, and entertain themselves—significantly improving efficiency.
The Lu Family had neglected the well-being of the people, resulting in many tragedies in the villages under Mount Huaqian. When the news spread, it deeply moved the residents of the towns.
The local theater troupes selected a few examples to adapt into performances, drawing large crowds to the Liyuan Theater. It was so lively that there were no seats that were left empty.
Even Li Xuanxuan watched half of a show secretly, then left with a shake of his head and a smile.
With this comparison, the previously taken-for-granted prosperous life of the residents in the four towns suddenly became interesting again.
With silver in their pockets, the men spoke with more confidence, and all industries thrived. Everything was moving in a positive direction.
The area between the two mountains now had over a hundred thousand residents, with over a thousand infants born each year.
Only one or two individuals with spiritual orifices were identified, but most of them lacked talent compared to those of the Li Family's bloodline, which have absorbed individuals with spiritual orifices for decades.
Most of these individuals were integrated into the Li Family and sent to watch over the spirit fields in various towns.
A fresh snowfall covered the entire mountain. Li Xuanxuan, who was in high spirits, carried a bag of Spirit Rice up the mountain. He quickly entered the courtyard.
He waited until Li Tongya finished drawing a talisman before approaching with a bright smile.
"Second Uncle, this is the first batch of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice of the year… totaling seventy jin!"
Yellow Jade Spirit Rice, a new offering since the Li Family became a Qi Cultivation Realm clan, could be sold for four to five times the price of ordinary Spirit Paddies.
It was harder to grow, requiring frequent spirit rain and the occasional adjustment of the earth's veins. If the cultivator was only at the first stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, it might take five or six of them to even be able to manage a single spirit field.
Only cultivators at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm could take care of the spirit field alone.
"Not bad."
Li Tongya nodded in contentment, examining the bag's contents.
The Spirit Rice, with its grains shining like yellow jade and brimming with spiritual qi, prompted him to say, "Truly a cultivator's nourishment! The spiritual qi is truly abundant. Our Li Family now needs to contribute three hundred jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice and two thousand jin of ordinary Spirit Paddies every five years. The rest, like various medicinal herbs, are easy; we can have the weak Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators plant those… You must manage these two types of Spirit Paddies well!"
"Don't worry, Second Uncle!" Li Xuanxuan assured as he cupped his fist, saying solemnly, "Now that we have Mount Huaqian, I've already dispatched people to cultivate it. Our Li Family can now produce four hundred and fifty jin of Yellow Jade Spirit Rice and over three thousand jin of ordinary Spirit Paddies every five years, which is more than enough!"
Li Tongya began drawing another talisman, pondering for a moment before responding, "Just remember, let those cultivators with lesser talents and lower cultivation realms work together on these spirit fields. Do not waste the time of cultivators who have condensed the Jade Capital Chakra on farming! Let them learn talisman arts... or strive to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. You need to balance it well, ensuring it doesn't feel too unfair to everyone—nor too fair."
"I understand."
Li Xuanxuan nodded obediently, before leaning in to whisper, "After managing our household for many years, I know well how to allocate our cultivators. Those with ordinary talents using common Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques will never break through to the Jade Capital, so I understand how to arrange them!"
"Good!" Li Tongya commended, now storing the talisman he had finished. He then asked, "Where is Feng'er?"
"He has gone to the prefecture with his savings to forge a dharma artifact. It has been three days, and he has not yet returned."
After Li Xuanxuan answered, he saw Li Tongya smile softly and say, "Being in seclusion for so long must have bored him. Let him have some fun."
Li Xuanxuan paused, then remembered something and said softly, "Second Uncle, there's news from the Chen Family. Chen Erniu passed away last night."
Li Tongya paused slightly, the tea bowl he had just picked up not reaching his lips before he placed it back on the table. He let out a somber sigh.
"It was inevitable... The elder was a cornerstone of our community decades ago, accomplished and with a clean family reputation. Truly rare! He was also related by marriage to our family… Let's go together to pay our respects."
Seeing Li Xuanxuan nod, Li Tongya's expression turned complex as he sighed quietly, realizing how the older generation had dwindled—Li Mutian, Liu Linfeng, Li Chengfu, and now Chen Erniu... He was nearly becoming the oldest among the related families.
The biting cold wind rushed through the remnants of the mountains into Lijing Town. It plastered the faces of people with bright white snowflakes and reddened the cheeks of children playing in the streets who still chattered incessantly despite the biting cold.
"Clan Brother Pingyi, Uncle Xiewen is a town leader! Last month, most of the cultivators in our clan went to Mount Huaqian. Did your father tell you what that was about?"
Surrounded by children either surnamed Li or Ye or from related families, they were all wearing cotton clothes and were looking up at the boy in the middle.
Li Pingyi glanced around before responding, "My father mentioned that there are three villages under Mount Huaqian with just over five thousand people. They have now received orders from the mountain to establish their own towns… This trip was for consolidating and exploring spirit fields."
Li Pingyi—the legitimate eldest son of Li Xiewen and the legitimate grandson of Li Yesheng, appeared quite clever.
With the younger generation not yet grown up and Li Yuanxiu being a quiet child who disliked causing trouble, Pingyi had become the default leader of the children, much to his delight.
"But that... Ah! It's people from the main residence!"
Before the children could ask more, two groups of clan soldiers suddenly appeared from both sides, trampling the snow piles on the streets into nothing.
Seeing the group of children, someone turned to report back.
The children scattered in a panic, yelling and screaming.
Amidst the chaos, Li Pingyi, being pushed and shoved around, fell to the ground with a loud thud. "Don't run! Don't run! You've all been spoiled by your fathers and uncles... Hey, don't push! They're only catching those who are lazy and tyrannical... We're just children, what's there to run from?!" he shouted, dizzy from having been pushed around so aggressively.
But before Li Pingyi could finish, the street had already cleared of children. As he got up, he found himself alone except for a pair of brown leather boots in front of him.
Without thinking, he cupped his fist and said, "My father is Li Xiewen! I'm not sure who you are..."
The area fell eerily silent, and the surrounding clan soldiers struggled to contain their laughter.
Li Pingyi slowly looked up, only to find his father Li Xiewen staring back at him, furious yet incredulous. Startled, Pingyi cried out, "Father! How did you find me here?!"
Li Xiewen glared at him, finding the situation rather amusing despite his stern appearance. He pretended to be angry, scolding, "Damn it! Using my name to engage in such antics?! We'll settle this when we get home. Now, come with me!"
Li Xiewen was strict on the surface but he was deeply pleased with his son. After all, he had been much duller back when he was the same age, constantly infuriating Li Yesheng. Had it not been for his brothers being even less capable, it's uncertain if he would have been the one to assist Li Xuanxuan in managing the town and mountain affairs today.
Li Yesheng and Li Xiangping had ventured beyond the mountain together, facing multiple life-and-death situations.
Li Xiewen, assisting Li Xuanxuan with the affairs of the four towns and two mountains, married a woman with a spiritual orifice.
Earlier this year, it was discovered his child did not possess one. Li Xiewen had already planned Li Pingyi's future, intending for him to follow Li Yuanxiu and continue the family's legacy...
Following behind, Li Pingyi eyed his father's white clothes and whispered, "Who died..? Such a grand affair…"
Li Xiewen nodded in approval of his son's observation, saying solemnly, "An elder from the Chen Family, one of the earliest town leaders who had connections with those on the mountain. Act solemnly; this funeral is significant. Don't disgrace me."
