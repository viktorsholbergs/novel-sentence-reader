Li Xuanling descended from the mountain, having already condensed the Radiant Lure Chakra and broken through the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.
His blade was polished so well that one could see their own reflection in it, crisp and clear as day. Clad in a plain, long robe, he bore a striking resemblance to Li Tongya.
The mountain folk matured early, and despite being only thirteen or fourteen years old, Li Xuanling had already grown considerably.
With a composed demeanor and steady gaze, he often reminded his older cousins—Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanfeng—of Li Tongya.
As late spring enveloped the land in vibrant green, the Spirit Paddies—now a year and a half old, were ready for harvest.
Villagers wielded large axes infused with the Golden Light Spell to cut down the paddies, while a few cultivators of Embryonic Breathing Realm outside of Li Family carefully husked the grains.
Observing the bustling activity in the fields, Li Xuanling smiled and approached for a closer look.
All of a sudden, an ear-splitting whistle pierced through the air, causing everyone to cover their ears in immediate discomfort.
“Who goes there?”
Li Xuanling’s expression turned solemn and alert as he instinctively placed his hand on the hilt of his sword. Looking up, he spotted a golden figure soaring through the air.
“A Qi Cultivator?!” he muttered to himself as he frowned, trying to make sense of what he was seeing.
He quickly took out a Signaling Talisman, ready to alert the surrounding area.
“Hahahahahahahahaha!”
The figure with a pitch-black longbow in hand let out a hearty laugh as he absorbed his golden true essence back into his body, revealing his face.
“Brother Xuanfeng! Y-You... you’ve emerged from seclusion?!” Li Xuanling exclaimed, his voice filled with astonishment as he stowed away the talisman he had previously readied, his face brightening with joy.
“T-This is great news!”
Li Xuanfeng laughed, and Li Xuanling immediately noticed how his gaze was a lot more piercing now that he had attained the Qi Cultivation Realm. His true essence was so powerful that it rustled the leaves around him as he descended.
“Can’t you have more confidence in me? It’s just breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm… it’s hardly worth celebrating!” he teased with a playful smile.
Despite his modest words, the pride on Li Xuanfeng’s face was evident. “What’s been happening at home these past months?” he asked, trying to change the subject.
“We have nothing but good news for you! An ore vein has been discovered!” Li Xuanling’s excitement was palpable as he shared the news. “Unfortunately, Father is still in seclusion. I must inform him about you immediately!” he said, immediately turning around and wanting to depart on his newfound mission.
“Hold on!” Li Xuanfeng interrupted with a shake of his head, stopping Li Xuanling in his tracks.
“You can tell him that later… tell me more about what happened recently. What kind of spirit mine is it?”
Li Xuanling was about to speak when he noticed Li Xuanfeng abruptly raising his head, his gaze fixed on the figure soaring through the air. “Who’s that?” he asked in a mix of confusion and curiosity.
Li Xuanling followed his gaze and saw a person riding the wind, emanating a true essence of Pure Spiritual Qi. Clad in a white robe with a rosy face framed by white hair, he held a jade scepter in hand.
It was Lu Sisi.
“Greetings, Senior!” Li Xuanling cupped his fist and greeted Lu Sisi respectfully.
“This is the senior from the Lu Family in the east,” he explained to Li Xuangfeng, noticing his confusion.
Realization dawned upon Li Xuanfeng as he cupped his fist and responded with a smile, “Greetings, Senior!”
Lu Sisi arched an eyebrow at him and appeared to think for a while before speaking.
“You’re…?” he asked slowly, unsure.
Although Li Xuanfeng felt slightly annoyed by the fact that this person had simply ignored Li Xuanling, he made sure to maintain a neutral expression as he introduced himself.
“I’m Li Xuanfeng of the Li Family.”
Realization dawned on Lu Sisi, who looked at him, taking him in as he rubbed his chin. After a while, he turned to the woman behind him. She wore a plain dress and her face was covered by a veil. Upon hearing Li Xuanfeng’s introduction, she raised her head to look at him.
“What brings you here, Senior?” Li Xuanling cupped his hand and asked respectfully.
Although Lu Sisi had ignored him a few times before, he looked at Li Xuanling this time and replied, “We’ve come to discuss a matter with your family’s elders.”
Li Xuanling promptly welcomed Lu Sisi to the mountain. Having grown accustomed to the place after several visits, Lu Sisi made himself comfortable in the mountain courtyard.
Li Xuanling arranged for tea to be served and went to fetch Li Tongya right away.
With Li Xuanxuan currently in seclusion to break through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, it fell upon Li Xuanling to manage the mountain affairs, leaving him with little free time.
As Li Tongya arrived, Li Xuanling took a moment to catch his breath outside the courtyard only to find Li Xuanfeng by his side in a fit of temper.
“That old man brought a young maiden along… I bet he’s here to arrange a marriage! What a clever and sly move!”
Li Xuanling paused, recalling the presence of the white-clothed girl.
“Father may not necessarily agree to it…” he remarked dryly.
Li Xuanfeng merely laughed mischievously, before he made his way toward the courtyard.
“Brother Tongya… I’ve prepared several spirit items and three spells as a dowry. What do you think of this… matter?”
Li Tongya frowned. Lu Sisi had personally come to propose a marriage, offering gifts including spirit items and spells as a dowry to marry off a daughter of their family. He insisted on marrying the girl to one of the two unmarried sons in the Xuan generation.
Li Tongya felt a sense of skepticism stirring within him.
The Lu Family’s proposal seemed unusually humble.
While he might readily agree to the girl marrying into the minor sect, Li Tongya could not help but consider carefully as this involved marrying the direct descendants of the Li Family.
The girl Lu Sisi brought along possessed a spiritual orifice. However, she was not particularly gifted as she had not even condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra and had only attained the first stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at fourteen years old.
Even so… Li Tongya could not help but be surprised by the unusually humble gesture.
“Lu Sisi seems hesitant about the long-term implications..."
With the Li Family’s rising strength, expansion into the east was only a matter of time. Li Tongya could not deny that he had never thought of annexing the Lu Family.
Making their daughter—who possessed a spiritual orifice— a concubine was out of the question. He would have to choose between Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling for the marriage.
However, Li Tongya foresaw potential problems. If he married the Lu Family’s daughter and they had a son within ten years, it could lead to complications. He would be burdened with accusations of exploiting his in-laws, tarnishing his reputation both internally and externally.
Glancing at Lu Sisi, whose smile masked his worries, Li Tongya feared that outright rejection might provoke retaliation. He stroked his chin and pretended to be deep in thought before answering tactfully.
“The children in our family are still young… if you seek a good marriage, it would be best to wait a few more years.”
Lu Sisi accepted this response with a smile as if he had already anticipated this to be the answer.
“That sounds fine… I shall return in a year to propose again!”
After discussing the Ebony Ore Mine and other trivial matters, Lu Sisi took his leave.
As they left the courtyard, Li Xuanling’s gaze met the sorrowful eyes behind the veil. It evoked a sense of empathy within him, and he could not help but feel sorry for the girl.
“What a pitiable person…”
When Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling entered the courtyard, Li Tongya’s expression immediately lit up.
“Xuanfeng?"
Upon confirming Li Xuanfeng’s cultivation at the first heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Tongya expressed his approval with a proud smile.
“Well done!”
Li Xuanfeng chuckled, and a glint of light golden true essence appeared in his hand as he spoke.
“This is the Golden Edge True Essence formed by the Golden Light Edge Technique… it’s swift and sharp, comparable even to the wind itself. It may disappoint slightly in terms of endurance… but overall, it’s quite impressive.”
Li Tongya nodded approvingly, his expression filled with satisfaction and pride.
“Good! You’ve done well. Xiangping’s spirit in heaven would surely find solace in this!”
A brief silence followed, during which Li Tongya sensed the need to steer the conversation away.
“What are your thoughts on the situation of the Lu Family?”
“The old man is scared.”
Li Xuanfeng responded almost immediately with a shake of his head, a trace of triumph lighting up his features.
“The juniors of the Lu Family are useless and he’s aging… naturally, as we grow stronger, they are now growing more fearful!”
Li Xuanling nodded and added, “I recently investigated the matters that you’ve tasked me with, Father. I learned that a member of the Lu Family from the previous generation once cultivated in the Azure Pond Sect… however, they passed away over eighty years ago, and there’s little else known about their lineage.”
“I see,” Li Tongya responded.
Taking a sip of tea and gazing to the east, his mind was lost in contemplation.
