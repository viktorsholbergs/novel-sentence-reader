Mount Qingdu.
Time flowed like a gentle stream. Mount Qingdu had fully established itself as a peak in the lake, seamlessly connected to the earth veins beneath it. It was no longer possible to tell that the mountain was moved here.
Li Xijun was practicing swordsmanship on the mountain. Compared to his brothers, he was not particularly gifted with swords.
Over the past two years, Li Ximing had broken through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm with the help of pills, and his cultivation was progressing well. Li Xizhi had also reached the seventh heavenly layer, while Li Xijun remained stuck at the sixth heavenly layer.
The last three heavenly layers of the Qi Cultivation Realm are really challenging. I'm less talented than them and had only managed to keep pace before due to receiving some advantages… It's only natural that I've fallen behind now.
Li Xijun remained positive, practicing his swordsmanship day and night. As he swung his long sword, he gradually developed a certain grace, thus attaining mastery of this technique.
"Threefold Moonlight is indeed difficult! After years of hard work, I've finally made some progress," he murmured happily to himself.
While he continued training, he noticed a monk landing on the peak with a long jade box slung across his back, gazing at him warmly.
"Master Monk, you're finally back!"
Kongheng had been away for two years. If it was not for Li Xizhi writing home, Li Xijun might have feared something had happened to the monk during his journey.
He glanced at the jade box on the monk's back before his eyes lit up with excitement. He exclaimed joyfully, "The dharma sword is done?!"
Li Xijun currently possessed no valuable treasures. Li Yuanjiao had given him Glazed Dusk, a string of red beads before, but he had given the protective dharma artifact to his younger sister, Li Yuexiang. For now, a sword was all that he had.
Even a calm person like Li Xijun, who seldom displayed joy, was elated by the fact that his elder brother had crafted a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact for him.
"Indeed!" Kongheng replied, nodding in affirmation.
He removed the jade box from his back and carefully took out the long sword inside it. The blade was thin, long, and white like fresh snow, gleaming coldly in the light.
Kongheng presented the sword with both hands.
"This sword measures three chi, nine cun, and three fen in length, weighing ninety-two jin and twelve taels. It is a Foundation Establishment dharma artifact crafted from cold iron and metal essence. As shimmery as the flowing water and as pure as white frost, it is named Hanlin."[1]
Li Xijun was entranced, unable to tear his gaze away. With trembling hands, he accepted the sword, nodding in awe.
"Good... Good..." he murmured in a daze.
The Hanlin Sword clanged as Li Xijun held it in his hand. Suddenly, the two characters inscribed on the blade lit up, emitting a radiant white light, as if rejoicing.
Turning his hand and holding the sharp sword upside down, the white tip touched his other shoulder, exuding a chilling aura. He measured the sword's length for a moment before expressing his satisfaction once again.
"Good!"
He raised his eyebrow and swung the sword, summoning a gust of cold wind around him. A cold light danced in the air before transforming into three streams of white, crystalline light that twirled and swirled around him.
"Threefold Moonlight!" he exclaimed.
Li Xijun exhaled deeply, and the three streams of light vanished. After so many years, he could finally execute the sword technique he had honed with the Hanlin Sword in his hand. The technique froze the rock beneath his feet and caused it to shatter into pieces.
"Nice!"
A deep and hoarse voice interrupted him. Li Xijun recognized it instantly. He quickly sheathed the sword and bowed respectfully.
"Greetings, Ancestor!"
Li Yuanjiao emerged slowly from the stone path with a pleased smile.
"You have a natural talent for swordsmanship. Your diligence and passion for the sword will ultimately bear fruit," he praised softly.
He paused, continuing with a hint of nostalgia, "Ancestor Tongya practiced swordsmanship for thirty years before mastering this technique… You've caught up with him."
Li Xijun immediately refuted this with respect.
"How can I possibly compare to the ancestor? I'm slow-witted! I've studied this sword technique for twenty years… The Ancestor may have practiced swordsmanship for thirty years but he had learned this technique in less than ten, after receiving this sword manual… It's unfair to compare us like that!"
Seeing the terror in Li Xijun's expression, Li Yuanjiao could tell that Li Xijun genuinely revered the ancestor and showed humility.
"Well, at least you're doing better than I did!" he remarked, clearly pleased.
Li Xijun was about to respond but Li Yuanjiao interrupted him with a wave of his hand, then took the Hanlin Sword. He inspected it closely and remarked in a deep voice, "The material is excellent… I suspect it's second only to the Qingche Sword. Its value will surely reflect that. Fortunately, it was modified and not forged from scratch… Send thirty Spirit Stones to Zhi'er. Make sure he doesn't stubbornly refuse it, lest it hinders his cultivation."
Li Xijun nodded. The Li Family had been doing well, with hundreds of Spirit Stones accumulated over the past few years. Spending a few dozen wasn't an issue for them now.
Li Yuanjiao returned the sharp sword to him and mumbled, "It's a well-chosen name."
Li Xijun pursed his lips, while Kongheng remained silent too. After a moment, the monk excused himself and quickly left.
Li Yuanjiao took out a small letter and said in a serious tone, "This is the letter Zhi'er sent home. It's been delivered to my cave dwelling for some time already… Take a look."
Li Xijun nodded, glancing at the letter briefly before replying, "In my opinion… I'd go overseas immediately. At least I can start looking for an island to establish a foothold, and at the same time, I can ensure Situ Mo is too distracted to target Profound Peak Gate."
"After all, Profound Peak Gate has a good relationship with our family, and Kong Tingyun is a friend of Second Uncle. We should join forces with her; at least we can ensure Situ Mo suffers a setback!" he added.
His mind raced as he made quick deductions.
"It would be best to identify Situ Mo's allies or connections and eliminate them first. That way, he won't be able to trace our whereabouts, greatly reducing the threat."
He continued softly, "Kongheng should stay here since he is the best at defense. With the family's grand formation in place and Situ Mo overseas and absent, we should have nothing to worry about."
While Li Xijun said that, he knew that once everything had been determined, the family would not necessarily need to be guarded by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.
However, he knew Li Yuanjiao was cautious by nature, so he held back from saying more.
Li Yuanjiao had been in seclusion for over two years, healing from his injuries. With the aid of numerous spirit pills, his cultivation had even improved slightly.
"That's a feasible plan… However, if Situ Mo's ally is indeed a Buddhist cultivator from Zhao State, we may struggle to find this monk without Kongheng's assistance, let alone confront him," he commented.
Li Xijun nodded slightly and replied, "Auntie is a powerful combatant and must go. So, Uncle is suggesting that we should leave Senior Wushao behind instead?"
Li Yuanjiao simply nodded in confirmation.
"Yes. We'll need that snake demon to guide us in the Eastern Sea, so we may as well deal with Situ Mo first, then let Qinghong return home to take his place."
"I guess that's the only way…" Li Xijun sighed softly before continuing with a doubtful voice, "but I worry that as soon as we set out from here, that person will be able to deduce our plans!"
"I asked Kongheng about this before. That person will have to pay a certain price to deduce my position, so it's not like he'll immediately find out. In this case, it's better to make a swift decision and leave immediately to catch Situ Mo off guard..."
Though Li Yuanjiao spoke confidently, a flicker of doubt lingered in his heart.
My family has gradually gained influence and can at least gather some news now… The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators likely won't make any moves. However, my greatest concern is the possibility of a group of Master Monks from Zhao State lying in wait!
He pondered this for a moment before deciding to send Kongheng to the Eastern Sea first, deliver a letter to Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate to inquire about the current situation, and then strategize from there.
1. Hanlin Sword is about 131 cm long and weighs 46.5 kg. Mortals like me can't imagine swinging something this heavy around. ☜
