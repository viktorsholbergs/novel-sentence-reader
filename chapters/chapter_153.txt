Li Tongya had just finished dealing with the Lu Family members on Mount Huaqian. Knowing that time was of the essence, he did not dare to delay any further.
He immediately rose to the wind and hurried toward the Lu Family's ancestral home in the distant Mount Tiaoyun, which was to the east.
"The Lu Family surely has more than these three legacies… When the Ji Family annihilated the Wan Family, although Wan Xiaohua destroyed the Wan Family's formation legacy before dying, the Lu Family also obtained many essential insights into the path of formation. Later, when the Lu Family broke through the Ji Family's defense on Mount Huazhong, they must have acquired these things as well… However, breaking through Mount Huaqian took a lot of time, and it's uncertain what the situation is now in the east."
After flying on the wind for the time it took to burn a stick of incense, traversing through dense, overlapping forests, Li Tongya finally caught sight of Mount Tiaoyun appearing before him. However, he was met by a young man instead.
This young man was clad in golden armor, holding an axe that glowed with the luster of jade, covered in a bright red layer of true essence qi shield. He clearly had attained the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
Lifting his head, he revealed a pair of spirited eyes, looking to be around fourteen or fifteen years old. He was staring at Li Tongya quietly as if he had been waiting for a long time.
"Excuse me..." Li Tongya started, slightly confused.
"I am An Jingming from the An family! I extend my greetings to you, Senior Tongya! I have been waiting here for a long time," the young man interrupted him with a cheery voice.
The young man's voice was clear and respectful and he was sizing up Li Tongya with a sharp gaze. He thought to himself, This must be Li Tongya! He certainly looks dignified and composed… I wonder if the sword in his hand is as remarkable as the rumors say..?
Li Tongya carefully observed him for a while, surprised by his youthful appearance, and thought, This is the rumored prodigy An Jingming from the An Family… so young! He looks to be only about fourteen or fifteen years old but has already attained the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Truly astonishing!
Li Xuanfeng, who was now twenty years old and having just passed this winter, had just reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. But even so, this achievement was aided by the increased cultivation he had received during the ceremony.
Furthermore, the Li Family's Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra was vastly superior to those of other families. Without it, Li Xuanfeng would have needed an additional three to five years to reach the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
The attainment of the Qi Cultivation Realm at the age of fifteen is a feat that even Jing'er in his year might not have matched.
Li Tongya remained silent for a moment, but An Jingming had already begun to speak, his tone painfully polite.
"I'm afraid I've made Senior Tongya come all this way for nothing… My elders have already negotiated with the Ding Family from Mushroom Forest Plain about Mount Tiaoyun. Although the remnants of the Wan Family have been absorbed by your family, and Mount Huaqian naturally belongs to the Li Family, the An Family dares not interfere. However, Mount Tiaoyun has already been promised to the Ding Family."
Li Tongya felt a bit displeased but did not continue the conversation. Instead, he laughed and said, "You are indeed young and promising… Aren't you afraid that by coming out so rashly, you might be harmed by the Yu Family?"
"Of course I am afraid! It is precisely because of fear that we led the Ding Family to Moongaze Lake."
An Jingming sighed softly, a hint of melancholy not befitting his age appearing on his youthful face.
"What my An Family has done is not honorable. I am willing to offer the An Family's share of the ebony mine as an apology, and I ask for Senior Tongya's forgiveness," he added respectfully with a slight bow of his head.
Li Tongya smiled at him, knowing that there was no longer hope to recover Mount Tiaoyun, and pondered to himself quietly.
The Vein Searching Technique is still in the hands of the An Family… If they were to withdraw their share and pull out their manpower, would we not have to ask for their help again? That would give them an opportunity to manipulate us! What a cunning little rascal!
But Li Tongya was not going to fall for it. He waved his hand and laughed, saying, "Come now, our families are pretty much neighbors. There's no need for us to come to such a pass… The An Family can retain a twenty percent share. We can all make money together!"
An Jingming smiled at this, nodding slightly. Suddenly from the west, a figure flew swiftly, with a dark longbow on his back that seemed to blend with the night.
It was Li Xuanfeng.
Li Xuanfeng had just steadied himself when his gaze collided with An Jingming's. They stared at each other for a moment before An Jingming quickly smiled and lowered his head while Li Xuanfeng appeared eager to test his mettle, the arrows in his quiver vibrating, creating a tinkling sound.
"That settles it then. I bid you farewell!"
Fearing being detained by Li Xuanfeng and Li Tongya working together, An Jingming hastily took his leave and headed north.
"That guy is very young but not weak in strength!" Li Xuanfeng praised.
Li Tongya nodded, commenting warmly, "This An Jingming is much more difficult to deal with than An Zheyan, definitely no simple opponent! Clans like the Lu Family, lacking successors, are ultimately in the minority. Both the An and Yu Families are in a state of revival."
Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly, but he did not think highly of Yu Mugao one bit. He only took An Jingming seriously and flew back west with Li Tongya in silence, laughing as he said, "An Jingming is a worthy opponent, but Yu Mugao is not! That person is uninteresting and insincere."
Li Tongya turned his head to look at him before reprimanding him in a serious tone, "Do not be careless! Yu Mugao is scheming and malevolent… He's not to be underestimated. It's better to face An Jingming than to confront Yu Mugao."
After chatting for a while, they landed on Mount Huaqian. Li Xuanling had just climbed up from the steps, his sword still dripping blood which trickled down, forming a puddle on the ground. Following him was Lu Anyu, who obsequiously called out, "Son-in-law! Son-in-law! There are a few more warehouses over here!"
"Father, Brother Feng!"
Li Xuanling did not heed his call, but instead cupped his fist at the two men and explained, "The Lu Family has a few more warehouses guarded by some loyal servants… I have taken care of them all. Apart from the secular gold and silver, I found thirty-one Spirit Stones and eight hundred jin of Spirit Paddies."
"Not bad."
Li Tongya nodded in satisfaction, and Li Xuanxuan assigned people to guard Mount Huaqian. Then, they all returned to Mount Lijing.
Lu Wanrong waited in the courtyard all night until she heard a lot of noises outside. She sent a servant girl to check and saw the servant returning beaming with joy. She whispered, "Miss, it's our Lu Family's people! We've managed to save their lives after all!"
"Don't talk nonsense! What Lu family? There won't even be a Lu surname anymore. If you don't remember this, losing your life will be the least of your worries, and you'll even drag me down with you!" Lu Wanrong hissed as she sighed lightly, her anxiety easing slightly.
However, with resentment in her tone, she continued, "I only hate that my cousin is as stupid as a pig! This matter could have been settled decently by both families… Given the Lu Family's inevitable dissolution by the other clans, if we had offered up the mountain and left before the Li Family made their move, it would have saved the Li Family's face and preserved the Lu Family's inner dignity without putting the Li family in a difficult position."
"Now… look at this mess! Not only is our clan destroyed and people killed, but it also puts both the Li Family and myself in an awkward position. It's truly infuriating," she muttered in anguish.
The servant beside her was at a loss for words, but then Lu Wanrong suddenly glanced up and a soft whisper left her lips.
"My dear…"
The door creaked open, and Li Xuanling entered gracefully, dismissing the clan soldiers around him. He smiled as he said, "From now on, there is no Lu Family. Those who wish to stay may pledge allegiance to my family; those who don't wish to stay, we have let them go eastward."
"Congratulations, my dear!" Lu Wanrong praised him softly, then frowned and asked doubtfully, "Did you really let them go..?"
Li Xuanling touched her head and lifted her up, chuckling lightly.
"Not really, but they believe it's true."
Lu Wanrong paused for a moment, then sighed in resignation.
"Well… it's done."
Li Xuanling looked at her for a while, but his thoughts were elsewhere.
Brother Xuan's eldest son, Yuanxiu, is now five years old, and our family has only two talisman seeds left. Father is planning to adopt another child under Fourth Uncle, which means there will be new demand for the talisman seeds… How will we have enough for the next generation?
Moreover, if the eldest son does not have a spiritual orifice, should we wait for a child with one to be born before giving it to them, or should the direct eldest have priority? It's not the scarcity that troubles us, but the uneven distribution. These matters are complex! If not handled well, it could lay the groundwork for fraternal strife... It requires deep contemplation and caution.
Thus, he lost the mood for celebration. He simply smiled at Lu Wanrong before saying softly, "There are still matters to attend to in the mountains… I need to go up once more. Rest for now, and I will come to see you tomorrow."
Seeing Lu Wanrong nod blankly, Li Xuanling then left. However, he stopped after a few steps and turned his head to look at her. He said in a serious tone, "I remember you had a clan brother who came to report earlier, still staying at the Li Family. What about him?"
Lu Wanrong knew whom Li Xuanling was referring to and quickly responded, "He's a mere mortal."
Li Xuanling then felt relieved and left the courtyard, murmuring, "Even mortals should not be underestimated… I should remind Brother Xuan about this."
