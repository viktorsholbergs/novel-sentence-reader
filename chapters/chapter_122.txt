Li Xuanfeng returned to the Li Residence and quickly reported the situation at the mine to Li Tongya.
Li Tongya nodded solemnly, taking in his words carefully.
“In a few days, I’ll visit the mine myself and personally oversee it, but first… you need to make preparations. Get Xuanxuan to fetch this year’s tributes, then head to the prefecture to submit the tributes on behalf of our family.”
Acknowledging Li Xuanfeng’s nod, Li Tongya retrieved a storage pouch from the stone table in front of him and handed it over.
“In this pouch is our sum of money—aside from the tributes for these five years along with our family’s savings of one hundred and fifteen Spirit Stones, it also includes a portion of River Pure Qi. This is nearly a decade’s worth of savings for our family… when you reach the Xiao Residence, look for Xiao Yongling. We’ve had good relations with them, so I trust him to arrange for a formation master to set up a defensive mountain formation for us,” he instructed.
“If there are any leftover Spirit Stones, spend them to purchase a good dharma artifact for yourself in the market. You can seek counsel from the Xiao Family regarding the Ebony Ore Mine. Gather news about your fourth uncle’s whereabouts if you can too… The Xiao Family is reputable and Xiao Yongling is a smart man, I trust that he wouldn’t cheat our Spirit Stones,” he added after a moment of brief contemplation.
“Understood,” Li Xuanfeng replied and nodded obediently.
Li Tongya paused briefly before issuing another instruction. “Make sure you remain humble and avoid conflicts… don’t be tempted by Spirit Stones. If any incidents occur on your journey, prioritize your safety at all times!”
Li Xuanfeng listened attentively to Li Tongya’s advice, nodding vigorously before taking his leave to bid farewell to Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling in the courtyard.
He left Mount Lijing, then flew eastward along the Guli Road.
Just as he crossed into the Lu Family’s territory, he could hear distant thunder that came from the west, though it was faint. Pausing to listen, he could not discern its source and resumed his journey to the east.
As soon as Li Xuanfeng exited Mount Lijing, the sky suddenly rumbled with thunder. In fact, it was so loud and thunderous that it startled Li Tongya greatly and caused his ears to ring.
“Who goes there?!” Li Tongya shouted as his eyes snapped open and he rushed out of the cave dwelling.
What greeted him was a crimson sky above Moongaze Lake to the north, where several fiery clouds converged, painting the entire area above the lake with the hue of flames.
Hidden amidst the sky were faint glimmers of a dharma artifact that floated above it all.
“The island at the heart of the lake... That’s where the market at Moongaze Lake is!”
In an instant, a massive transparent protective barrier enveloped the small island at the heart of the lake. Li Tongya’s true essence surged as he levitated into the air and noticed a dozen figures levitating in the sky.
“The market of Moongaze Lake has been operating here for over two hundred years under the Azure Pond Sect’s approval… do you understand, fellow Daoists?”
As Li Tongya stood in the air, he heard an old voice reverberating across the lake. It was tinged with anger—and it clearly belonged to the owner of Moongaze Lake’s market.
“I heard that the owner is a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm… it seems the assailants are at least cultivators of the Foundation Establishment Realm as well,” Li Tongya pondered quietly to himself as he flew over thirty miles and observed the market from afar.
Initially, there had been a large island at the heart of Moongaze Lake, precisely where the market stood. However, with the onset of the attack, the hidden island emerged. It resembled a fairyland, boasting lush greenery and pristine waters, with pavilions and buildings scattered across it which only served to enhance its beauty.
“Quit acting, Chen Taoping! You’ve been hiding in Moongaze Lake for two centuries… if it weren’t by chance, we wouldn’t have discovered you!” spoke another voice—this one firm and unwavering. It echoed across the vastness of the lake.
Li Tongya listened intently, his spiritual sense tingling as he twisted his head to observe the western sky. There, he spotted an approaching figure who was adorned with tattoos, wearing animal bones and jades.
It was Mu Jiaoman.
Mu Jiaoman had also ascended up into the sky to check in on the situation after catching wind of the commotion. Caught off guard by Li Tongya’s gaze, he hesitated briefly before awkwardly greeting him through voice transmission.
“Brother Tongya…”
Li Tongya noted the fear in Mu Jiaoman, whose body language suggested that he was ready to flee at any given moment.
Li Tongya ignored him. Instead, he focused his attention on the unfolding events over at the lake.
After a brief pause, the old voice responded once more.
“Chen Taoping? Who is Chen Taoping? I am Zhang Cuotian… fellow Daoist, you should not be compelled by others and offend the immortal sect for nothing.”
However, the other voice laughed coldly in response, almost in mockery.
“Don’t try to stall for time… the Azure Pond Sect has granted us permission. Today marks the end for you Lingyu Gate remnants! We have borrowed the Deadly Thunder Formation Destroyer, I’m afraid your formation won’t be able to protect you!”
As soon as he finished speaking, fiery rain and lightning descended from the sky, striking the grand formation with such fierce intensity that it caused its glow to flicker slightly. The lake was illuminated in bursts of white and red while rogue cultivators gathered around to watch the unfolding scene in astonishment.
Li Tongya estimated that the grand formation would collapse within the time taken for an incense stick to burn. The sky erupted in a cacophony of colors and sounds as several figures clashed in midair, their battles creating strong shockwaves that sent ripples across the lake.
“What a big commotion! These people are probably at the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm and on the cusp of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.”
As Li Tongya observed the chaos, he noticed a group of figures completely disregarding the shockwaves of the battle and barging into the market that was no longer protected by the grand formation. It was obvious that they were driven by malicious intentions.
“That’s very tempting indeed…”
Li Tongya narrowed his eyes at Mu Jiaoman whose eyes were clouded by greed, looking as though he himself wanted to join those nuisances.
However, Mu Jiaoman's greedy expression was replaced with shock as soon as he met Li Tongya’s fierce glare.
“Fifth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm?! How is that possible?!” Mu Jiaoman exclaimed. He clearly recalled that Li Tongya was only at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm when they fought… how did he attain the fifth heavenly layer in just two years?!
Li Tongya said nothing but just returned a tight smile, causing Mu Jiaoman to shudder involuntarily. Without looking back, Mu Jiaoman swiftly retreated—several hundred meters away through a shamanic spell.
Meanwhile, Li Tongya refocused his attention on the clashes unfolding over the lake. He stroked his chin and mumbled, “It’s too dangerous for me to go there… I should just wait here until those people come over.”
He found a better spot to wait and settled in to observe the situation in the market, patiently anticipating the emergence of those who had robbed the market.
“Chen Taoping! Where is the River Mountain Sutra?!”
As the battle in the sky intensified, an old man dressed in a flowing white robe and wielding a spear, found himself outnumbered three to one. He fought valiantly but was gradually pushed back, clearly losing. His jaw was tightly clenched in frustration.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about!” he yelled out in anguish.
“Hmph, still keeping up with the tough act even when you’re already on the verge of dying,” one of the cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm sneered coldly. His dharma artifact blazed with lethal intent and with a swift strike, he narrowly missed severing Chen Taoping’s arm by probably only a few millimeters.
“Although the Lingyu Gate has been destroyed, its legacy must remain concealed. Once we capture you, you will reveal the River Mountain Sutra’s location!”
“Bah!” Chen Taoping spat, waving his spear. “I seek no revenge for my destroyed gate! I only wish to live out my days in peace on this lake… why do you deny my wish and continue to haunt me?!” he yelled.
His assailant frowned and replied, “When the Lingyu Gate was destroyed, the River Mountain Sutra was lost among the sixty-one jade slips… this is a grave matter! We have searched for it for more than a century now… but to no avail. If not for this, we would not have resorted to such measures either!”
“All of you are so… cunning.”
Chen Taoping’s expression turned sorrowful as he found himself cornered.
However, his expression soon hardened. “If I had the River Mountain Sutra in my possession, I would have attained the Purple Mansion Realm instead of lingering around at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm! I wouldn’t have had to hide!” he spat fiercely through gritted teeth.
His assailant paused for a moment upon hearing his statement but continued waving his dharma weapon which unleashed beams of golden light that exhausted Chen Taoping.
“Our orders are clear. We must capture you and extract the information we seek,” he declared with a vindictive voice.
