Li Qinghong stepped onto the stone-paved road on Mount Lijing—a path that was laid decades ago, and now the time that had passed by was evidenced by how it was now fully covered with moss.
She heard it was laid during the time her third granduncle, Li Xiangping, led the family. In fact, a few of the craftsmen involved were still alive.
Walking up the mountain, Li Qinghong looked around. It had been days since she last saw her younger brother, Li Yuanyun. After searching the mountain, she finally found him in their aunt Li Jingtian's side courtyard.
The boy sat there, engrossed in a wooden slip. Entering the courtyard, Li Qinghong felt a twinge of unease.
"Brother Yun…"
Having received a talisman seed on the mountaintop almost a year ago, Li Qinghong had been busy with cultivation and spear training. Li Yuanyun rarely visited the main courtyard, and their infrequent encounters left Li Qinghong with a sense of guilt; especially since knowing her brother could not cultivate.
"Ah, you're here, Big Sis! It's been quite a while since I last saw you," Li Yuanyun exclaimed as he brightened up, setting aside the wooden slip.
Li Qinghong smiled sweetly, noticing the wooden slip titled 'Two Hundred Years of Linghai Prefecture's Scenery—Annotated by Li Jingtian' on the table.
Curious, she asked, "You used to dislike these long and boring history books… What made you start reading them?"
Li Yuanyun chuckled.
"Since I can't cultivate, and I certainly can't compare to Brother Xiu in managing our home, I thought I'd find something I can do. I've come to our aunt's place to study, hoping I can be of help to her in the future."
His words hit Li Qinghong like a physical blow, causing her to awkwardly change the subject with a forced smile.
"Have you gained anything from reading this?"
Li Yuanyun sighed softly, picking up the wooden slip again. "After reading this, I feel only... fear," he muttered.
Puzzled by his response, Li Qinghong asked curiously after composing herself, "Fear..? What's there to be afraid of?"
"I always thought our family was harmonious, with Mount Yue already subdued and our parents in a loving marriage. I believed we lived in a peaceful world…" Li Yuanyun confessed, his voice betraying a hint of terror as he gripped the wooden slip tightly.
"...But this book showed me the turmoil beyond our borders, lands awash with blood, filled with plots and schemes. The endless cycle of conspiracies makes one realize how vile the world can be. Our Li Family might seem stable now, but who knows what dangers lurk in the shadows? It's disheartening to see how filthy this world truly is."
"Sister, although being born into the Li Family means being clothed in silk and feasting on delicacies where even a mortal without spiritual orifice can enjoy a life of pleasure, I am truly terrified. I fear waking up one night to find our family's protective formation shattered, shimmering immortal swords descending from the sky, and dying in my sleep without knowing why," Li Yuanyun confessed, his eyes reddening with emotion.
Li Qinghong was speechless for a moment. However, she composed herself and found her words, speaking softly, "Father once said: the rules of this world are set by immortals… Would immortals care about the morality of mortals? Of course not! They would resort to any means necessary..."
"Sister," Li Yuanyun lifted his head to look at her, speaking softly, "I've read our family history. Mount Huaqian was taken from the Lu Family, which was also our mother's maternal home… but it's destroyed now. I've seen Mother cry in secret, perhaps it is because of this…"
His voice trailed off.
Li Qinghong fell silent for a while before responding, "If the Li Family hadn't taken it, the An Family would have by the next day. The Li Family wasn't wrong, and neither was the Lu Family. The situation developed to this point as the only way out when there was no other choice. If the head of the Lu Family had been wise, this could have ended gracefully. The fault—if any, lies with him."
"You're right, Sister…"
Li Yuanyun put down the wooden slip, his mood seeming to have lightened considerably.
"It's a pity that my perspective is limited. Otherwise, I'd write a Two Hundred Years of Moongaze Lake's Scenery, surely as interesting as that of the Linghai Prefecture!"
Li Qinghong smiled softly and was about to speak when the courtyard door creaked open. A woman in her mid-twenties with long, flowing hair tied up behind her head walked in. She set down her paper parasol and greeted warmly, "Ah, you're here, Qinghong."
"Auntie!" Li Qinghong giggled, hurrying over to embrace Li Jingtian. However, she was not expecting to see another middle-aged man with a dignified air following her aunt into the courtyard.
He greeted her politely.
"Oh, you're here too, Uncle!" Li Qinghong exclaimed in slight surprise.
Chen Donghe nodded. The children found their uncle, who was a Qi Cultivator, stern and unfamiliar since they rarely saw him. Feeling awkward in his presence, they quickly excused themselves.
Li Jingtian nodded, smiling as she saw them off. She then turned back to the courtyard, noticing Chen Donghe examining the rows of wooden scripts on the table.
"What are you looking at?" she asked softly.
Chen Donghe stroked his chin, marveling, "The Li Family's bloodline is truly extraordinary. The speed at which Qinghong and Yuanjiao have broken through to the Profound Scenery Stage is astonishing! Even Xuanxuan and Xuanling were exceptional back in the day. It seems they were born cultivators!"
Li Jingtian lowered her gaze to hide the flicker of sadness in her eyes. She simply turned her head away and laughed.
"That's nothing surprising. After all, they carry the bloodline of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."
Chen Donghe nodded without giving it much thought. Once he confirmed there were no others around with a sweep of his spiritual sense, he spoke softly, "I don't mean to worry you, but these days I've made some observations that unsettle me… I'm considering whether to discuss it with Second Uncle or Xuanling on the mountain. I need your insight on this."
"What's the matter?" Li Jingtian asked as she joined him at the table, listening as Chen Donghe spoke seriously, "Currently, our family has dozens of external cultivators. Although most are only at the first or second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, they shouldn't be underestimated. These individuals are distributed across various territories to cultivate spirit fields, or assigned as guardians of towns, responsible for tasks like demon extermination and healing."
Pausing here to allow Li Jingtian a moment to digest the information, Chen Donghe continued, "These people represent the voices of various forces outside the Li Family… With several factions headed by three cultivators at the fourth and fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, their actions are not always clean. The Clan Affairs Courtyard doesn't strictly control them, and I fear that over time, this may lead to problems."
Li Jingtian pondered for a moment, her delicate hands neatly arranging the wooden slips on the table before she responded in a soft voice, "The Clan Affairs Courtyard has eyes and ears everywhere… I'm sure they have already noticed the issues you mentioned. It's likely that these matters have already been brought up to Xiu'er or perhaps even to the cave dwelling on Meiche Peak by now. If the family has yet to address this, there might be other considerations at play."
"These people represent not just themselves but also the interests of the branches and minor clans they come from. Conflict is inevitable, and who knows…"
Seeing Chen Donghe looking at her, Li Jingtian leaned in closer, whispering softly in his ear with a gentle voice, "The one letting them fight might just be our Xiu'er."
