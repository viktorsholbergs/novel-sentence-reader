【Beautiful Girl Detective Akashiterika!】The Superbad Treasure Theft Case 4
* * *
Now, guided by Director Rakigataa, Akashiterika and the others passed through the entrance hall where Steel Index and other exhibits were displayed, proceeded through the staff passage beyond… and reached the innermost part of the museum—the ‘treasure vault’.
The stolen Superbad Treasures were stored in this treasure vault until they disappeared, and they intend to start their investigation there.
“That’s… quite an old door, isn’t it?”
Even Akashiterika, although acquainted with Director Rakigataa, had never been to this place, inaccessible to the general public.
She muttered that, staring intently at the metal door of the treasure vault.
The only thing that looks new is the wooden plate above the door, with the words ‘Treasure Vault’ carved into it.
Judging from its material and simple, heavy design, the door itself was probably made about two hundred years ago.
It’s not exactly a work of art… but anyone would recognize it as a historical artifact at a glance.
That’s how old it is.
“Gufufu… When this museum was opened… my father, the previous director, renovated this mansion, which was passed down from our ancestors… but he didn’t touch this treasure vault at all.”
“What do you mean? Isn’t that a problem… in terms of security?”
“Not really, Akashiterika-sama.”
Saying that, Director Rakigataa inserted a key into the metal door and turned it.
Click—a sound echoed.
“The family motto of our Frozend Marquis House, which was also a warrior family… is ‘If you prepare, you will win’.”
Next, Director Rakigataa, putting strength into his thick arms, pushed open the heavy metal door.
What’s beyond the door isn’t a treasure trove… but a narrow corridor.
And at the end of it, there’s another door.
“In other words, ‘If you’re cautious and prepared for every possible situation, you can win any battle’. Generations of the Frozend family have been raised to live by this teaching, not just in times of war, but at all times. Therefore, our ancestor, who built this treasure vault hundreds of years ago, also set traps as a precaution to protect the treasures…”
And Director Rakigataa, turning around, started explaining to Akashiterika and the others.
“…………”
This is going to be a long story.
Having that intuition, Emi lightly erased her presence, ignored Director Rakigataa, and stepped into the narrow corridor beyond the metal door.
Incidentally, the reason she erased her presence is because of her occasional sense of propriety, thinking, ‘It’s rude to ignore him when he’s trying to explain things to us’.
If she thought it was rude, she could have just listened to him, but putting that aside—
Anyway, Emi didn’t listen to Director Rakigataa, and lightly erased her presence.
That was a mistake.
Because Emi erased her presence, Director Rakigataa couldn’t notice her movements.
“…Wait!?”
Even so, after a few seconds, Director Rakigataa noticed Emi moving ahead, and hurriedly tried to stop her, but—
He was a little… too late.
…The next moment—Click.
A sound echoed from under Emi’s feet.
And then—
Suddenly!
The wall to Emi’s right opened—Pakari—and a spear thrust out at a murderous speed!
“EMIIIIIIIIIIII!”
Akashiterika, startled by the sudden event, screamed, her face pale!
And Emi!!
“Oh dear.”
…Effortlessly… caught the spear… between her right index finger and thumb…!
But the traps in the treasure vault don’t end there!
Again, a clicking sound echoed from under Emi’s feet!
And this time, the wall to Emi’s left opened—Pakari—and a sword thrust out at a murderous speed!
“EMIIIIIIIIIIII!”
Akashiterika, startled by the sudden event, screamed, her face pale!
And Emi!!
“Oh dear.”
…Effortlessly… caught the sword… between her left index finger and thumb…!
But the traps in the treasure vault still don’t end there!
Again, a clicking sound echoed from under Emi’s feet!
And this time, the ceiling above Emi opened—Pakari—and a murderous iron ball, about a meter in diameter, fell down!
“EMIIIIIIIIIIII!”
Akashiterika, startled by the sudden event, screamed, her face pale!
And Emi!!
“Oh dear.”
…This time, she was hit directly on the head by the iron ball… but she seemed completely unfazed, without any visible damage…!
Now, since the traps seemed to have subsided for now, Emi let go of the spear and sword, shook off the iron ball on her head, and turned to Akashiterika and the others.
“Dang—”
And the moment she took a step forward, saying something!
She fell into a pitfall that suddenly opened up—Pakari—and was sucked into the bottomless darkness…!
“Emi…”
…But she immediately crawled out of the pitfall, and calmly returned!
And then, walking briskly towards Director Rakigataa!
“That’s dangerous! Is this a defective building!?”
She yelled, pissed off!
“It’s a trap! Listen to me! It’s not a defective building!”
Director Rakigataa also yelled back, childishly!
“Ah! Emi… Emi…!”
Akashiterika, relieved that Emi was unharmed, rushed to Emi and hugged her tightly!
“I see, the treasure vault is full of traps… If someone tries to steal the treasures, they’ll normally end up in the underworld…”
Detective Munodes, wiping the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief, organized the information!
“In other words, the one who stole the Superbad Treasure… is someone who wouldn’t die from the traps!!”
And then Detective Munodes, realizing something, his eyes widened!
“In other words, Emi-chan! The culprit… is youuuuuuu!?”
He shouted, and pointed at Emi!
“““!?”””
Emi, Director Rakigataa, and Akashiterika froze at the sudden accusation!
“…………”
But Akashiterika immediately regained her composure and started moving.
She ran towards Detective Munodes—Tat-tat-tat.
And then, she jumped—Pyon.
Silently, she unleashed a flying knee kick to Detective Munodes’ face!
“GUEHHHHHHH!?”
Detective Munodes was blown away by the force of the blow, and rolled off somewhere.
