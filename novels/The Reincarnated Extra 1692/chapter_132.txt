132Start the Operation, Deogandai!
* * *
“…Kukuku… Kakakaka… Kakakakakaka!”
While gazing out the window at the thundering wilderness of the ‘Dark Continent’ Sardisann that stretches beyond the Demon Lord’s Castle, Deogandai, a middle-ranked commander in the Demon Lord’s Army, was reveling in the memory of Caro’s haggard appearance after her demotion was decided.
“Ahh… Kukuku! Serves her right! That incompetent little girl with nothing but high stats!”
‘Stats.’ The specs of an individual.
They are the absolute limits predetermined according to one’s role when a demon is born.
An absolute disparity that cannot be overturned no matter how much effort the individual puts in.
Something that was abundantly bestowed upon the elite Caro, but only moderately given to Deogandai.
The root of the inferiority complex that Deogandai secretly harbors in his heart.
“Just watch, you executives…! In the end, what the Demon Lord’s Army needs isn’t incompetent fools who rest on their innate stats!”
The hierarchy in the Demon Lord’s Army is determined by the level of one’s stats.
It’s a stat supremacy system.
Amidst that, Deogandai takes pride in having achieved results beyond his stats by making the most of his own abilities, which while not low, are certainly not high either.
“One with the talent to fully utilize their own stats and aptitude… In other words, I am the one who is truly needed by the Demon Lord’s Army!”
He must make them understand that.
Through even greater achievements than before.
Through the success of this operation!
Thump!!
Still riding on his rising excitement, Deogandai spins around as if dancing and slams his fist on the call buzzer placed on his desk!
Boo…
A low trumpet-like sound can be faintly heard ringing in the next room through the wall.
A few dozen seconds later, a short female demon enters Deogandai’s office.
“Excuse me. Did you call for me, Deogandai sir?”
“You’re late, Longinus! How many minutes did you intend to keep me waiting?!”
“My apologies.”
This female called Longinus holds the position of a low-ranked assistant, and her job is to provide clerical assistance to Deogandai, a middle-ranked commander.
Since she has low stats and lacks combat power, low-ranked assistants are relatively looked down upon in the Demon Lord’s Army.
Even this time, despite Longinus wrapping up her work and hurrying over as quickly as possible, this is how she’s treated.
“Listen well! Unlike you, I am busy! Do you understand how much of a loss it is for the Demon Lord’s Army when you sluggishly move about and keep me waiting?! Hurry up and get it through your head!”
“My apologies.”
…Deogandai detests the stat supremacy system.
Yet even he unreasonably abuses Longinus, a low-ranked assistant.
No, more than that, Deogandai treats his subordinates exceptionally poorly compared to other superiors.
Simply put, he has a bad personality regardless of his ideals and beliefs.
He directs his envy towards those above him in status, and takes out his frustrations on those below him under the pretext of his own position.
That’s the kind of man Deogandai is.
On the other hand, Longinus is a woman with a relatively steely mental fortitude.
Even now, she tunes out Deogandai’s persistent sarcasm and ponders what to have for lunch.
“Hmph… Well, whatever. Now then, I called you here to check on the progress of the next operation.”
Finally, the sarcasm ends.
This time he wrapped it up in about a minute, which is on the shorter side for Deogandai.
The shorter the sarcasm, the more work can get done, so Longinus is quite pleased.
“I believe I had given you several instructions before, correct? Report on the extent of preparations for each one!”
“Yes. The necessary materials and monsters have already been fully prepared. The application for using teleportation magic has also been submitted, and approval is expected to be granted tomorrow.”
“Good… Very well. I’ll praise you for a job well done, considering you’re a fool.”
“Yes. Thank you very much.”
Brushing aside the long bangs covering the left side of his face with a flourish, Deogandai grins.
(Seriously, what’s with that hairstyle? It doesn’t suit him at all and looks gross.)
Longinus thinks to herself.
“Kukuku… In one week, another human town will vanish from existence. And another of my great feats will be etched into the history of the Demon Lord’s Army!”
An exceptionally loud thunderclap resounds.
Behind Deogandai, outside the window, the flashing lightning casts deep shadows on his grin.
“Consider it an honor to be destroyed by me…! Fortress City Liheid!!”
