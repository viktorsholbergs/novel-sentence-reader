"Yu Mugao looked incredibly arrogant, clad in fluttering black attire and wielding a divine weapon. He taunted, "The phoenix resides in the parasol tree~ Do you dare to descend, little cultivator?"
The tavern buzzed with activity as the audience craned their necks to hear better. Throngs surrounded a man clothed in gray at the center of the room, who stroked his goatee as he performed.
"An Jingming, a top-notch immortal talent, scoffed and retorted loudly, I am blessed with the bones of an immortal; favored by the heavens! How dare you, an insignificant centipede, refer to yourself as a parasol tree in my presence~"
As soon as the gray-clothed man had finished speaking those words, the crowd erupted into shouts and applause. He smirked, stroking his beard, evidently pleased with his own performance.
At the edge of the crowd stood a boy of about eleven or twelve, dressed in a leather coat with snow-white fur around the cuffs. It was easy to tell that he was the scion of a wealthy noble family.
Though everyone's attention was not focused on him, they nonetheless were aware enough to leave a space enough for him to stand. The boy held the hand of a younger child, around five or six years old, who looked clever and beautiful.
"Brother Xizhi! An Jingming sure is popular," the boy chirped in his tender voice.
The noble-looking teenage boy beside him simply waved his sleeve and chuckled.
"An Jingming was a remarkable talent who had performed countless heroic deeds during his lifetime, though his end was tragic… It's only natural that people remember him fondly."
The younger boy nodded, though he could hardly make out the distant applause over the din.
"And then..?"
The boy nodded though with uncertainty. Being small in stature, he could not get a clear view of the stage. The crowd was cheering loudly and he could barely hear his voice over the performance.
"And then?" he repeated eagerly.
"And then… the tales recount how he fought against many foes alone, vanquishing them in swift succession. From that moment, he roamed freely between heaven and earth, unfettered," Li Xizhi replied casually, his hands clasped behind his back.
"The tales..?"
Li Xizhi tilted his head, unable to resist asking his next question with innocence in his voice.
"What about in reality?"
"He was killed by the Yu Family. They preserved his severed head and it's probably displayed in the Yu Family's vault now…" Li Xizhi said as his expression darkened.
Every teenager had the dream of practicing qi for three years and establishing the immortal foundation in ten, so he could not help but feel sorry for An Jingming's tragic demise despite being such a talented man.
He held Li Ximing up and said gently, "If you spend less time watching plays and more time reading our family's history… you'll come to understand the bloody realities beyond these tranquil towns."
Li Ximing rested his head against Li Xizhi's chest and hummed in response.
All of a sudden, a figure appeared before them, carrying a sword at his waist. His face was solemn, but his voice was tinged with resignation as he said softly, "I looked everywhere for the both of you…"
Li Xizhi glanced at the man and replied, "Congratulations, Uncle Gongming… I supposed Qi Cultivators are built differently! You actually found us quicker than the Jade Court Guards."
Xu Gongming was in a good mood since he had just recently emerged from seclusion after achieving his breakthrough in the Qi Cultivation Realm. The praise from Li Xizhi caused a smile to appear on his face as he humbly replied, "You flatter me, Young Master."
The Li Family had enjoyed a period of peace over the past five years. News of Li Tongya single-handedly repelling the Yu Family and vanquishing a Maha had spread far and wide, earning him the reputation of the Celestial Moon Sword, garnering recognition even in the Wu and Xu States.
During these years, several members of the Li Family had attained the Qi Cultivation Realm. Madam Dou was among the first, cultivating with the Minor Pure Spiritual Qi. Her accomplishment brought great honor and prestige to the Dou Family.
Next was Xiao Guiluan, who cultivated a Grade Three technique from the Xiao Family with Clear Dusk Origin Qi. Specializing in detoxification and employing soft techniques to subdue enemies, her prowess exceeded that of ordinary Qi cultivators like Madam Dou.
With Xu Gongming's recent breakthrough and Li Xuanxuan who was currently working at the marketplace, the Li Family now boasted five Qi Cultivators, which was already sufficient enough to safeguard the family's interests.
"Why were you looking for me?" Li Xizhi, now at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, asked while holding Li Ximing in his arms.
Xu Gongming replied softly, "Second Old Master has returned from Wutu Peak and is speaking with the family head in town right now… He requests the both of your presence."
Upon hearing his father's return from Wutu Peak, Li Xizhi's demeanor grew serious.
"Understood. Thank you for informing me, Uncle Gongming!"
With that, he activated the Divine Movement Spell and hastened toward the foot of the mountain.
Li Yuanping, nearing twenty years of age, possessed a gaze that could exert pressure on anyone due to his many years of managing household affairs. Despite his pale complexion and cultivation merely at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, his presence commanded respect.
Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao, clad in his usual black attire, sat next to Li Yuanping. He had recently attained the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
Holding a pale purple jade slip, he asked in a deep voice, "Xizhi took Ming'er out again?"
"Yes…" Li Yuanping chuckled in response. "Xizhi will be leaving home soon, this is a good time for them to bond while they still can."
Li Yuanjiao nodded silently. A year earlier, Yuan Tuan of Qingsui Peak had emerged from her seclusion and broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm by successfully forming her immortal foundation known as Azure Manifest Peak. She had assumed the position of peak master since then, initiating disciple recruitment.
Upon emerging from seclusion, Yuan Tuan immediately sent a response to the Li Family's letter. She wrote warmly, first expressing condolences for Li Chejing's passing and then announcing her upcoming visit to Moongaze Lake in a few months to assess Li Xizhi's aptitude.
Although the Li Family lacked the methods of the three sects and seven gates for assessing root bone, Li Xizhi's rapid cultivation progress—reaching the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm in just six years—clearly qualified him to join the Azure Pond Sect.
Setting aside his brush, Li Yuanping noticed Li Yuanjiao's somber expression and asked, "What brings you all the way back here, brother…?"
Li Yuanjiao frowned and replied, "It's about time to submit tributes to the Azure Pond Sect."
"Don't worry, despite the waning demonic plague, our businesses in the markets are still thriving. We've seen an increase in unrefined Qi Cultivators out there and a bountiful harvest of spirit resources. We have enough for this year's tributes," Li Yuanping assured him.
"I've been busy with preparations for the past few days and have ensured everything is in order. Nothing will go wrong," Li Yuanping added confidently.
Li Yuanjiao nodded approvingly. "I'm relieved you've managed our affairs so capably these past years," he praised.
He then lowered his voice and continued, "However, I received word from Guiluan… Yu Muxian of Yuanwu Peak will oversee this year's tributes. He's already on his way to Moongaze Lake on the Dawn Cloudliner!"
"Yu Muxian?! That indeed complicates things..." Li Yuanping muttered as his expression darkened.
Li Yuanjiao exchanged a knowing glance with Li Yuanping, both aware of the delicate nature of the situation.
After all, Li Tongya had severed Yu Xiaogui's cultivation. Rumors speculated that Yu Xiaogui had been sustaining his life just by using spirit medicines and sacrificial rituals in recent years.
Yu Muxian enjoyed wide connections within the sect, with supporters on Yuanwu Peak who were ready to stand up for him.
However, Yu Muxian himself had yet to take any action, likely intimidated by the formidable reputation of the Li Family's Sword Immortal that echoed throughout the region. As a result, no one dared to find trouble with them.
Now, a Foundation Establishment Immortal Cultivator, personally arriving at Lake Wang Yue, carried significant weight. However, Li Yuanjiao could not help but feel uneasy despite the reputation of the Li Family's Sword Immortal heritage, linked with the Green Spike Sword Immortal and the Moon Que Sword, was indeed formidable.
Now, as a Foundation Establishment Immortal Cultivator, Yu Muxian was personally coming to Moongaze Lake. Naturally, Li Yuanjiao was secretly uneasy about this, even though the Li Family was widely known as the legendary Sword Immortal Clan, where the Qingsui Sword Immortal and Celestial Moon Sword were recognized as formidable brothers.
"No one knows the hardships of their own family better than themselves…"
Only Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping knew about Li Tongya's passing. Li Yuanjiao pondered silently for a moment before offering reassurance, "I once heard from my late uncle that Yu Muxian is self-serving and ungrateful. Moreover, our family enjoys the protection of an immortal clan… Perhaps he won't push matters too far!"
Li Yuanping nodded slightly as a semblance of relief crossed his pale face.
At that moment, a teenage boy draped in brocade strode into the courtyard, holding the hand of a little boy who was by his side.
Li Xizhi approached respectfully, cupped his fist, and greeted the men.
"Greetings Father, Uncle."
