Having said that, he ascended on his rainbow light. His wife, Yang Xiao'er, was already waiting in the air, her expression concerned. She glanced at him questioningly. Flying alongside her, Li Xizhi spoke in a playful tone, "The elders in our family are too obsessed with decorum. Years of operating as a clan have made them overly cautious… Seeing the ties between our families, they cannot bear to refuse outright. But so what? Yuan Chengdun merely wishes for us to protect his descendants. Protect them we shall, but must it involve marrying off my sister?"
He paused, his usually calm and gentle demeanor giving way to a ferocity reminiscent of his father, Li Yuanjiao. In a cold tone, he added, "Lacking courage and wisdom, oblivious to propriety… If Yuexiang fancies him, so be it. But must my sister endure grievances just to repay an ambiguous favor? What kind of logic is that?"
Yang Xiao'er held his arm gently and said, "Thankfully, these were just a few private words. Otherwise, it would not sound too good if it spread... Yuexiang is a thoughtful person, but Yuan Fuyao truly does not understand her."
"Enough..." Li Xizhi waved his hand dismissively and replied, "My sister handles herself well and has long prepared a fallback plan. What does it matter if it sounds good or not? Mark my words, if we give him the betrothal gifts, that boy will probably celebrate in secret."
The two returned to the peak, stepping into the main hall. Li Yuexiang approached with a smile, her eyes almost speaking on her behalf. Not much time had passed since they left, and everyone else was still in the hall. Li Xizhi said, "I have played the bad guy already. Little sister, go deliver the betrothal gifts to him yourself. You are good with words—he might even feel grateful to you."
Li Yuexiang responded softly, "Thank you for the trouble, elder brother."
Although Li Xizhi had taken it upon himself to handle the matter, he maintained a respectful tone towards Li Xuanxuan, saying earnestly, "Grandfather, I acted on impulse and spoke in a way that ended this matter decisively. I hope I have not delayed any family affairs..."
"Go, go... Do not talk nonsense to tease an old man like me." Li Xuanxuan lifted his foot as if to kick him. Li Xizhi smiled and stood up. Watching the siblings' seamless coordination, Li Xuanxuan sighed deeply and said in his aged voice, "This is already the best outcome."
Li Yuexiang retrieved several jade boxes from a cabinet in the hall. Inside were neatly placed embroidered pouches. She blinked her almond-shaped eyes and held them carefully before riding a fiery cloud down the mountain toward the cave dwelling.
Yuan Fuyao, lamenting in his cave, was startled when someone came to report that Li Yuexiang had arrived.
Summoning his energy, Yuan Fuyao quickly brought along two attendants and hurried outside. As he watched the elegant beauty descend on a fiery cloud, he blurted out, "Yuexiang, you are here! I..."
Just as he was about to explain, Li Yuexiang offered a gentle smile and gestured for silence with her hand. She retrieved several jade boxes from her sleeve and said with a soft laugh, "Take a look at these!"
Yuan Fuyao took the boxes, opened them one by one, and used his spiritual sense to peer inside. Within, he saw dazzling gemstones, shimmering elixirs, dharma artifacts, spirit items, precious herbs, and demon cores, piled like mountains and gleaming brilliantly. He was momentarily transfixed.
Inwardly, Li Yuexiang let out a soft sigh. Speaking gently, she said, "My elder brother mentioned that you do not wish to remain in our family for long. He believes that your character is upright, that you are a virtuous man with no ulterior motives."
Her words immediately startled Yuan Fuyao out of his trance. He opened his mouth to explain, but before he could, her next sentence left him speechless. "In that case, these items—originally left by Senior Yuan Chengdun as a betrothal gift for my family—are now returned to you in full. They are exceedingly valuable, so please take care of them."
Her words placed these treasures and herself on opposing sides, shattering any attempts Yuan Fuyao might have made to reconcile the situation.
"My family's promise to Senior Yuan Chengdun still stands. The Li Family will always provide you with a safe haven and protect you to the best of our ability." Li Yuexiang handed over the jade boxes, released them, and said softly, "Take care, Fellow Daoist."
She quickly departed on the wind, leaving Yuan Fuyao standing dumbfounded in place. Despite having treasures in hand that could sustain three generations of cultivation without worry, he didn't feel the excitement he had anticipated. Instead, he felt a strange sense of loss.
"What a fine woman." Pushing aside his feelings, Yuan Fuyao noticed his attendants' wide-eyed expressions of amazement. The emptiness in his heart gave way to a fleeting sense of security. Sighing, he murmured, "Now I have some leeway..."
Yet as his thoughts churned, he found himself muttering again, almost bitterly, "Now there is no leeway at all..."
This year, the Li Family's sacrificial rituals at the foot of the mountain were smaller in scale compared to previous years. The flooding of the surrounding lands made it unsuitable to carry out grand ceremonies. In the great void, Lu Jiangxian observed from afar, noting that the population in the affected prefectures had drastically declined, and resentment and grievances were rising.
"The situation in Mushroom Forest Marsh is nearly settled," he murmured.
While the Li Family could not see what was happening on the plains, Lu Jiangxian saw it all clearly. Within the Yuan Family, the faction aligned with the Chi Family was gradually taking control. Yuan Huyuan's position grew increasingly precarious, and it seemed unlikely he could hold out much longer.
"It is not just this lingering Yin rain... but also the anguished cries of millions of commoners that are disrupting the Profound Balance Atmosphere." Lu Jiangxian quietly observed, unable to intervene directly. He simply reached out in the reflection of his mirror and drew in the talisman qi from the sacrificial ritual, refining it slightly before infusing it into Li Xizhi, who stood at the altar.
By now, Lu Jiangxian was no longer the same as before. Narrowing his eyes, he watched as glowing pathways of energy appeared on Li Xizhi's body, draped in his feathered robe. The talisman qi began to form two distinct patterns.
One was surrounded by faint vermilion runes, a color somewhere between red and pink, sharp and angular with its strokes turning at precise angles, "Vermilion Flowing Rainbow."
This talisman had two primary effects. First, it enhanced the innate talent of any offspring born to the bearer, making them more gifted and intelligent. Second, it strengthened the bearer's mana, increasing the power of their immortal foundation and improving their flight speed.
The second was encircled by a halo of light orange, fading gradually into pale yellow and white at its edges, its script radiant and warm, "Rainbow Pierce Skyway."
This talisman preserved and revitalized mental strength, bolstered the spirit, and allowed its bearer to better comprehend and unravel others' spells. It also supported the bearer's mana circulation, subtly enhancing their spell casting abilities with every session of secluded cultivation.
More uniquely, this talisman had the rare ability to nurture and extend life. While it could not match the effects of talismans like Death-Averting Longevity in warding off disaster, it could provide minor blessings and protection.
Lu Jiangxian observed briefly and thought to himself. The Vermilion Flowing Rainbow would only benefit the bearer's offspring. Since Li Xizhi was already a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator and Yang Xiao'er was at the Qi Cultivation Realm, it would be difficult for them to have more children, rendering this aspect largely irrelevant.
However, the Rainbow Pierce Skyway was a rare talisman qi with the ability to enhance fortune and improve over time as cultivation continued. Given that Li Xizhi's cultivation technique was carefully chosen, combined with his protection as a member of the Azure Pond Sect, he was among the most secure individuals in the Li Family. This talisman qi seemed a perfect fit for him.
With that decision, Lu Jiangxian waved his hand, and the talisman qi turned a bright yellow before merging into Li Xizhi's body. Then, his gaze shifted to Li Zhouwei.
Over the years, the connection between Bright Yang Metallic Essence within Li Zhouwei had grown increasingly pronounced, manifesting in many unusual traits. Lu Jiangxian silently waited, thinking to himself, When he accepts a talisman and begins cultivating, I can leverage the bond between the talisman seed and its host to help him control and moderate these influences… avoiding any excessive displays of power.
