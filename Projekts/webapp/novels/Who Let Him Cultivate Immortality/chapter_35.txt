Chapter 35: The Female Demon
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Hearing the term “Qilin Immortal Medicine,” Lu Yang was instantly on alert. Qilins were thought to be extinct, and likewise, the Qilin Immortal Medicine was almost unheard of, with very few plants known throughout history. In fact, some say there’s only one Qilin Immortal Medicine in the entire world.
Qilin Immortal Medicine in reincarnation.
An ancient sage once speculated that there were no real Qilins in the world, believing them to be creatures of fantasy. Records of Qilin sightings were attributed to the Qilin Immortal Medicine.
Without opening the Heavenly Eye, it’s easy for people to mistake the Qilin Immortal Medicine for a real Qilin, just like Lu Yang did now.
“Old Ba sent me here to loosen the soil,” Lu Yang explained.
“Oh, so you’re here for soil loosening. Do you know the Five Elements magic?” The Little Medicine Kings seemed pleased upon hearing this.
Finally, someone was here to work.
Lu Yang’s face showed his dilemma: “I can’t say I’m proficient, but I stumbled upon it. I’m not sure if it counts as Five Elements magic, but I can burrow into the ground.”
Lu Yang felt his spell was more of a spatial magic, only exhibiting characteristics similar to the Five Elements magic.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s Five Elements magic or not, as long as you can burrow,” said the Flower of Time’s End nonchalantly.
Since the earthworm couple took their leave, they had been hearing complaints from the herbs about the soil being too hard, not airy enough, and wanting to pull out their roots to breathe and bask in the sun. This task had been troublesome for the Little Medicine Kings.
Now, that problem could be resolved.
People rarely know about the existence of Medicine Kings. Before this, Lu Yang didn’t recognize a single one. The Little Medicine Kings possess incredible medicinal properties. If they appeared in the outside world, they would drive the great cultivators mad with desire.
Actually, Lu Yang did recognize one.
He identified the sunflower in the hands of the Flower of Time’s End. Its petals opened and closed, shedding its black shell to reveal a white, jade-like interior, which became nourishment for the Medicine King — it was eating sunflower seeds.
And there were sunflower seed shells scattered all over the ground.
Lu Yang wondered if this counted as cannibalism.
“Oh, this is called a sunflower,” remarked the Flower of Time’s End, noticing Lu Yang’s gaze.
Lu Yang thought to himself, I know what it is.
The Medicine Kings were all small in stature. Rather than saying they were cracking sunflower seeds, it was more like they were hugging the seeds and nibbling on them. It was evident that the Flower of Time’s End was enjoying its snack.
“End King, you’re littering again. How many times have I told you, we are plants, don’t imitate humans by eating sunflower seeds. Even the shells are edible!” scolded the Qilin Immortal Medicine, reprimanding the Flower of Time’s End for its human-like behavior.
The Flower of Time’s End was nonchalant: “I planted the sunflower on my own, I can eat it however I want. What’s it to you? Pah.”
This angered the Qilin Immortal Medicine, which pounced towards the Flower of Time’s End. The two Little Medicine Kings started scuffling, tumbling over each other without any real harm.
The ginseng child and the Three-Leaf Star Medicine were used to this sight and urged Lu Yang to demonstrate his burrowing technique.
“Don’t mind them, they’ll stop when they get tired.”
Outside the wooden hut, Lu Yang saw a gigantic tree. Its roots were as thick as legs, full of life, and its dense foliage rustled vigorously.
“The Understanding Tree?”
Lu Yang was astonished. Even if he returned to his normal size, this Understanding Tree would still be massive enough to shade the sky, requiring dozens of people to embrace its trunk, not to mention he was only three inches tall now.
The Enlightenment Tree exudes an aura of Dao, its leaves rustling as if whispering the sounds of Dao, as if all the great Dao of the world converged upon it, shaping its essence. The Enlightenment Tree is mysterious and majestic, inviolable.
“This is the Enlightenment Tree I mentioned to you before, we all call it the Tree King. Its talent in the Dao is nothing short of extraordinary,” said the Ginseng Child.
The leaves of the Enlightenment Tree can aid in enlightenment. If the Enlightenment Tree itself becomes sentient, one can only imagine how profound its talent in cultivation must be. Despite appearing frail, each of the Medicine Kings possesses their own unique divine abilities, not to be underestimated.
Without their life-saving skills, relying solely on the mercy of humans, they wouldn’t have survived until now.
The Tree King joked, “Ginseng King, you’re flattering me again. If I’m at the top, then what kind of talent does that female demon have?”
“Who is this female demon?” Judging by the tone of the Medicine Kings, she didn’t seem like a good character.
“In the medicine garden, besides Old Ba, only the female demon can come here. She’s incredibly powerful, we can’t beat her. Whatever she wants to pluck, she plucks, no medicine can stop her!”
“My old ginseng whiskers were plucked by her. It hurt so much I had to lie in bed and rest for several days,” the Ginseng Child angrily denounced the female demon’s outrageous behavior.
“The stars on my leaf surfaces were also plucked by her. Look, don’t these few stars seem dimmer than the others? I don’t even know how long it will take for them to grow back!”
In the description of the little Medicine Kings, the female demon’s wrongdoings are too numerous to be recorded, and every medicine longs for her retribution.
“What’s even more infuriating is that she said she would take these things back for a bath. Can you imagine, she actually bathes with parts of our bodies, that’s too perverse!”
“By the way, I heard from Old Ba that the female demon holds a high position in your Dao Seeking Sect, called Yunzhi.”
Lu Yang: “……”
He realized he wasn’t surprised by this answer at all. Is it a problem with the Senior Sister or himself?
Lu Yang forced a laugh, a bit awkwardly, not sure what to say, “That, um, the Senior Sister you mentioned, I think I know her. She’s actually my Senior Sister.”
The Tree King laughed heartily, unconcerned, “That’s nothing. Who doesn’t know that disciples of the Dao Seeking Sect all call her Senior Sister. Do you think by saying you’re her junior brother, we would take our anger out on you? You are underestimating us Medicine Kings. We have lived for countless years, why would we care about a mere human?”
Lu Yang, seeing the Tree King’s understanding attitude, breathed a sigh of relief, “That’s great, so it seems even if I and she are disciples of the same master, it’s not a big deal.”
The laughter of the Tree King stopped abruptly, even the gentle breeze paused at this moment, and the leaves stopped rustling.
The Ginseng Child waved its whiskers, its calm expression carrying a hint of a vicious smile.
The stars on the leaf surface of the Three-leaf Star Grass began to swirl, like a volcano on the verge of eruption, ready for revenge.
Suddenly, a murderous aura enveloped the atmosphere.
Lu Yang calmly explained, “Don’t act rashly yet. Do you think that just because I’m the junior brother of that female demon, I truly stand on her side?”
The Ginseng Child looked at Lu Yang skeptically, slowing down the waving of its whiskers, “Is that not the case?”
The Tree King and the Three-leaf Star Grass also held back their attack momentarily.
“A grave mistake!” Lu Yang asserted firmly, clenching his fists tightly, revealing an expression of painful reminiscence.
“That female demon’s actions are absolutely deplorable. Not only have you suffered her bullying, but I too have been deeply harmed!”
“On the surface, it seems I am glorious, with a bright future ahead, but who can I tell about the torment I have suffered!”
