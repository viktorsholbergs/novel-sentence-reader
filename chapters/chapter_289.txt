Lu Jiangxian had just imparted the two talisman qi, and the auras of Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong surged almost immediately. Both of them were delighted, quickly sitting cross-legged to stabilize their cultivation.
The surrounding members of the Li Family were overjoyed as Li Xuanxuan exclaimed in surprise, "Two talisman qi!"
"These young ones have really made us proud!" Li Tongya nodded with a smile. The group completed the remaining rituals before descending the platform, waiting for the two juniors to fully absorb the talisman qi.
Soon, Li Qinghong was the first to open her eyes. Her lively gaze swept around her surroundings, and seeing that Li Yuanjiao was still meditating beside her, she quietly stepped down from the platform.
She cupped her fist to the elders and said with a smile, "Qinghong has received the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow talisman. Now, my cultivation has reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and I can begin to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm!"
"Excellent!" Li Xuanling responded with a smile, hugging his daughter tightly. Li Qinghong then explained the various effects of the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow talisman.
After listening carefully, Li Tongya laughed heartily and said, "This talisman qi is excellent for combat. Our Li Family already has a formidable archer, and now with your spear, we need not fear any battle!"
Everyone laughed and praised her, and only then did Li Yuanjiao slowly open his eyes. He stepped down from the platform and announced joyfully, "I have received a white talisman called Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit."
"A white Foundation Establishment Realm talisman!"
The group had sacrificed a Foundation Establishment Realm demon, so a white talisman should be granted. However, it was not uncommon for the mirror to consume the offering and grant a talisman pill instead of talisman qi. Hearing this, they were overjoyed.
Li Yuanjiao continued, "My cultivation has reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and I just need a specific spiritual qi of heaven and earth to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. I believe that the talisman qi still has some remaining power that will further enhance my cultivation once I become a Qi Cultivator!"
"This talisman qi is excellent for enhancing cultivation, controlling clouds, summoning rain, and can ease the process of gathering qi..." Li Yuanjiao said as he explained the benefits he had received from the talisman qi.
Li Tongya nodded and instructed, "Once Xiao Guiluan is married into our family and the wedding ceremony is completed, you should enter seclusion to break through."
"Understood!"
Seeing Li Yuanjiao agree so obediently, Li Tongya nodded and asked somewhat anxiously, "Have you decided which cultivation technique to pursue?"
"I intend to cultivate the River One Qi Technique," Li Yuanjiao answered readily.
"Good… Good!"
Hearing Li Yuanjiao's answer, Li Tongya felt greatly relieved. He had feared that Li Yuanjiao, like Li Qinghong, would pursue the powerful Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, potentially risking their lineage.
Seeing that Li Yuanjiao had no such intention, Li Tongya was spared the need for further dissuasion and nodded repeatedly, beaming from ear to ear.
"Excellent… Excellent indeed!" he praised once more.
Xiao Family.
The small peak was adorned in red, creating an exceptionally festive atmosphere. Figures constantly descended from it as the bustling crowd exchanged their congratulations.
Xiao Guiluan's courtyard was lavishly decorated and was absolutely beautiful. From outside, someone called out, "Congratulations! The Li Family is a sword immortal clan… Young Lady is truly fortunate!"
A deep male voice answered, "Thank you, Clan Uncle!"
Xiao Guiluan immediately recognized it as her elder brother, Xiao Guitu.
She furrowed her brow slightly as she asked, "Is Father really unwilling to come?"
The attendants around her shivered in silence.
Xiao Guiluan sighed softly, her exasperation clear on her face. "He's beyond redemption!" she murmured in disappointment.
Since childhood, Xiao Guiluan had already been sent to the mountain and received no care or concern from her father, who only wanted her to break through the Qi Cultivation Realm quickly and serve the family.
Xiao Guiluan saw him only as a figurehead in the family. To her dismay, the man was heartless, leaving her to fend for herself. She gave up impressing him and instead demonstrated her intelligence and shrewdness before the elders in the main family.
Fortune had finally smiled upon her, and after many years of no outside marriages from the Xiao Family, Xiao Guiluan was finally chosen as a bride to be married off. Her father, in his foolish rage upon hearing the news, seemed ready to sever ties with his own daughter.
However, Xiao Guiluan felt no anger, only deep sorrow in her heart. Without support from her natal family, her life in the Li Family would be challenging.
Composing herself, Xiao Guiluan quickly adjusted her red dress, its golden edges shimmering in the bright sunlight. She gazed into the bronze mirror, lightly pressing her red lips together and applying some rouge. Her already outstanding appearance became even more striking with this added touch.
"My lady, there are only very few in the prefecture who can match your beauty!" the servant beside her praised proudly.
Xiao Guiluan simply shook her head gently and said softly, "Stop with the flattery..."
"Sister…"
Xiao Guitu walked slowly into the courtyard. Although he was a legitimate son, he treated his younger siblings well and had come today to see Xiao Guiluan off.
"Thank you, brother!" Xiao Guiluan said as she expressed her gratitude earnestly.
Xiao Guitu understood what she meant by this and shook his head, replying, "Do not worry about the family. The marriage has been personally arranged by a Daoist Master, and so I will be here to support you."
"A Daoist Master arranged this?" Xiao Guiluan repeated, taken aback, and her heart filled with joy. Her mind raced and she felt reassured instantly, saying happily, "Thank you for telling me this, brother!"
As they talked, a boy of about ten years old, dressed in red which was embroidered with gold thread, approached them while holding a white jade disk with a hole in the center.
In a childish voice, he said, "Madam, it is time to depart!"
The jade disk symbolized the joyous union, a tradition in the Lixia region. It required a boy from the bride's family to carry the jade disk and accompany the bridal sedan, personally handing it to the groom. In return, the groom would give gifts and money, or in the case of cultivators, spirit items and dharma artifacts.
The boy, named Xiao Xian, was chosen by Xiao Guiluan herself. He was the eldest son of Xiao Jiuqing, who had provided Spirit Stones for Xiao Guiluan's dowry. Not wanting to be indebted to Xiao Jiuqing, Xiao Guiluan picked Xiao Xian to ensure the gifts from the Li Family would repay the favor.
"All right," Xiao Guiluan replied with a sweet smile. Knowing that a Daoist Master had arranged the marriage gave her newfound confidence, and her expression brightened. Her phoenix eyes sparkled with hope as she took Xiao Xian's hand and left the courtyard, only to find someone standing in front of the bridal sedan.
This person exuded a gentle aura, with a series of medicine pouches hanging from his waist as he held a scroll on alchemy in his hand. He glanced at Xiao Guiluan's appearance and smiled, saying, "You look well-dressed. Time to get on the sedan!"
"Greetings, Clan Uncle!"
"Greetings, Senior!"
Immediately, everyone around them kneeled, bowing deeply.
Xiao Guiluan's mind went blank for a moment, then filled with joy as she thought to herself, A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator escorting the sedan... such grand honor!
Seeing everyone trembling around him, Xiao Yuansi cocked an eyebrow and shook his head. Having learned from the Li Family that Li Yuanjiao had been secretly adopted by his junior brother, he was even more interested in this marriage. Since he was already at the Li Family's place, he had decided to come and escort her himself.
Xiao Guiluan nodded repeatedly, quickly lifting Xiao Xian and settling into the sedan, her heart filled with anticipation and anxiety.
