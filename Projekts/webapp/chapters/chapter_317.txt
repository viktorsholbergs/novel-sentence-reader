"Save me, fellow Daoist..."
"Hand over the panacea!"
…………
Since Li Xuanling had decided to return south, he naturally flew straight toward the south. Along the way, he witnessed chaotic scenes—battles between immortal and devil cultivators over treasures, and Buddhist cultivators subduing demons with both sides suffering losses. Despite opportunities to take advantage of such situations, Li Xuanling was determined to return home and flew southward without stopping.
Among the members of the Li Family, Li Xuanling had the deepest mastery of the River Crossing Torrential Step. Thus, he navigated through his journey effortlessly, avoiding any trouble as he flew along. Soon, he reached the border of Xu State where a great river surged. The waves crashed against the shore, forming layers of snow-white spray, presenting a magnificent and captivating scene before him.
Known as the ancestor of southern water veins, this great river divided the north and south, its turbulent waters being one of the most abundant sources of water qi in the land. The upper reaches extended deep into Zhao State, winding around Mount Luoxia before flowing into Wu State. Any cultivator attuned to the energies of large rivers and streams, like Li Xuanling, who practiced the River One Qi Technique, would inevitably pause to admire such magnificent scenery.
"The vastness of the river..."
When Li Xuanling first traveled north, he had passed by this great river. He spent several days there to cultivate, as it relaxed his mind and greatly improved his cultivation. Now, seeing it again upon his return, he felt an uncontrollable surge of emotions, compelling him to land by the riverbank and gaze at the pale green waters flowing east, feeling an overwhelming sense of his own insignificance.
"The momentum of life is like the flow of this great river—beyond one's control."
Reflecting on his northern journey, Li Xuanling realized that his initial aimless wandering in Xu State had inexplicably turned into a determination to visit Mount Luoxia. This thought, like a landslide or tsunami, had driven him north to Zhao State.
If not for being interrupted by Fahui, I would still be ensnared by this idea, unable to escape... Was it truly my desire to go, or was it the will of some Purple Mansion Realm or Maha?
A chill ran down Li Xuanling's spine as he pondered the possibility of being manipulated by unseen hands, making the chaotic events along the way even more frightening.
All these occurrences—like the emergence of precious panacea and Buddhist cultivators subduing demons, could have been illusions crafted to lure me further north!
Deeply disturbed, Li Xuanling walked along the riverbank until he saw a large reef. On the reef sat an old man in a straw raincoat who was dripping wet, patiently disentangling a messy fishing net.
The old man's sharp eyes fixed on Li Xuanling who had just approached, causing him to halt abruptly. As a sense of foreboding overwhelmed him, Li Xuanling's mind echoed with realization, I have been ensnared by a spell!
He immediately activated his mana, but before he could take flight, the old man spoke loudly. "Boy! There is no need to head further south!"
Li Xuanling had barely lifted off the ground before being forced back down, finding himself unable to move save for his lips.
"A Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master!" he exclaimed.
"You truly had strong willpower. We used beautiful women, demons, treasures, and wealth along the way, yet none of it could sway you even a little..."
The fisherman lowered his head again, focusing on the tangled fishing net in his hands, and said gently, "I had to step in personally to intercept you."
Li Xuanling, still unable to move, could only open his mouth slightly and murmur, "I am just a Qi Cultivator, and you are a great immortal. Why go to such lengths to ensnare a lowly cultivator like me..."
The fisherman laughed heartily, staring intently at Li Xuanling and replied, "This plan has been in the works for decades, and it cannot fail. It was no easy task to lure you north, and who knew you would be this cautious… It should not have required such trouble."
Li Xuanling suddenly felt the constraints around him loosen as the Daoist Master removed the bindings. Realizing there was no escape, he simply sat cross-legged, looking defeated. "If I am not mistaken, you are after my father. I am merely bait, right?" he asked.
The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master shook his head and shot a glance at him, smiling once more.
"Incorrect. Your father is the bait."
A chill ran down Li Xuanling's spine. He opened his mouth and said in a hoarse voice, "But my father is always cautious. I am afraid he will not satisfy your expectations."
The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master shook his head again and said softly, "Li Tongya has no choice but to come. He already has a premonition; otherwise, he would not be sitting quietly on Mount Lijing."
With a sigh of respect, the Daoist Master continued, "We Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have observed the changing world for hundreds of years and seen all kinds of people. I must say, Li Tongya is remarkable but not ruthless enough. He cannot let go of his family and principles, so he must sit and wait for his fate."
Li Xuanling was silent, clutching the long sword at his waist, tears welling up in his eyes as his face turned red. He asked, "If my father and I both go to our deaths, can the Li Family have a night of peace?"
The fisherman gave him a deep look, clapped his hands, and replied, "The demon den of Mount Dali and Xiao Chuting will protect your family. The Li Family will be fine."
Li Xuanling exhaled deeply, intending to ask more, but the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master waved his hand and said, "Enough! I answered out of respect for your father, but you keep asking questions. Go, head to Mount Luoxia!"
Li Xuanling pressed his lips together, and sighed deeply in his heart. He had no choice but to cup his fist to the Daoist Master before flying northward.
The Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master stayed behind, tidying up the fishing net, grumbling, "What a mess, unable to control even the fate of a Qi Cultivator! To think that I had to intervene myself..."
The cold winter gradually swept in, and the news of Xiao Yongling's breakthrough reached the market. Li Xuanxuan prepared a modest yet substantial gift and personally delivered it to Cloud Crowned Peak to congratulate Xiao Yongling.
Xiao Yongling, having successfully reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, was in high spirits. He looked at Li Xuanxuan with a complex expression as he received the jade box on the table. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he recognized the spirit pill inside as the finest among the Qi Cultivation Realm and nodded.
"You are too thoughtful."
"Thank you for your care over the past few years, Senior..."
Li Xuanxuan had been managing the market for these years, and Xiao Yongling's presence had indeed been a significant help. He was naturally full of gratitude and responded respectfully.
Upon hearing this, Xiao Yongling hesitated slightly. He rubbed the jade cup before him with some restraint, wanting to speak but holding himself back. After pausing for over ten breaths, he waved his hand somewhat disheartened and pointed to the white-robed man beside him who was holding a long staff. He said, "After I leave, Ruyu will be in charge of the market. If your family has any important matters, you can go to him."
"Greetings, my lord!" Li Xuanxuan greeted as he cupped his fist immediately.
The white-robed Xiao Ruyu smiled lightly. Now at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he said softly, "I have a good relationship with Brother Xuanfeng… There is no need to be so formal. Just call me Ruyu."
After exchanging a few words, Li Xuanxuan cupped his fist and took his leave. Xiao Yongling frowned, his expression showing some guilt as he watched Li Xuanxuan's departing figure. Weary, he said, "Li Xuanling has most likely reached the north. With the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' maneuvers... I cannot speak plainly. The ancestor did his best to be subtle, but this is the result, leaving me feeling ashamed toward Li Tongya."
"It is something beyond our control."
Xiao Ruyu appeared more mature, his eyes firmer, and his voice heavier as he spoke, "Our Xiao Family... has done all we could."
Xiao Yongling gave a bitter smile and replied, "Who knows... This is the best outcome. No family can dominate Moongaze Lake. Once this matter passes, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators will hopefully settle down, sparing us from living in constant fear."
