Chen Xun and the big black ox listened with fascination, 'floating as if in a fairyland'.
That feeling, as if listening to...
Si Luo was originally a down-and-out girl who had once had emotional entanglements with Yu Dong, the young master of Moyu Pavilion.
Later, the cultivators recognized Si Luo and brought her into the sect, but she was ridiculed and mocked by countless fellow disciples, and her forbearance only led to more intense ridicule...
Just defeat Si Luo in the championships, make her admit defeat, and you can listen to her revenge plan.
Excellent!
Chen Xun and the big black ox kept munching on melon seeds, still listening to the surrounding cultivators constantly supplementing, their eyes wandering.
On the stage of the battle, the rainbow light of spiritual energy constantly exploded, all kinds of magical weapons came out, and there were shocked voices everywhere.
They kept circling around the periphery, sometimes looking at this battle platform and sometimes at that one.
There will be big battles in the Foundation Establishment stage later, which are considered substitutes for the championships.
"Oh my, this is incredible." Chen Xun made thousands of low-grade spirit stones a day, feeling pleased, "The big black ox, it's about fifty-fifty between Kong Yuyuan and Shen Yu, they're both pretty strong."
"Moo~!" The big black ox nodded, its head constantly turning outward.
"That Si Luo girl is also fierce, but that Young Master Yu Dong seems a bit lacking in momentum?"
"Moo!"
They moved further and further away from the crowd, finding a vacant spot to sit down, and finally the noise around them ceased, replaced entirely by the sound of astonishment and buzzing.
Chen Xun took out a piece of dried meat from his storage bag and said, "Big black ox, let's split this."
"Moo~" The big black ox happily moved towards him and wagged its tail.
"Old Ox, let's not go to the Flower Festival." Chen Xun leisurely ate the jerky, his gaze still on the battle platform.
"Moo?"
"We've inquired about it, haven't we? That's where the geniuses make friends—all talented in arts like music, chess, calligraphy, and painting—but we're not. Although my paintings are enough to amaze the world, others are just juniors; there's no need to snatch their opportunities." Chen Xun's face turned slightly red. He glanced at the big black ox inadvertently, "Although my paintings are enough to amaze the world, others are just juniors, there's no need to snatch their opportunities."
"Moo~~~" The big black ox seemed to understand; it took a long time to breathe out before finishing.
Chen Xun raised an eyebrow, casually patting the big black ox. It got startled. Why did it feel like he had malicious intentions? I didn't think much about it.
For three consecutive days, Chen Xun and the big black ox sat in place watching the Championships of the Golden Core stage, and many dark horses emerged, and there were shouts of surprise everywhere.
Many 'ordinary geniuses’ stepped forward to challenge, but before they could finish their arrogant words, they were directly beaten and heavily injured, and then retreated.
They were just spectators, sitting on the ground far away, laughing foolishly, munching on melon seeds.
Passing cultivators didn't know what they were laughing about, probably because they were overwhelmed by the championship battles.
However, for Chen Xun and the big black ox, the feeling of being at ease, not being targeted or mocked, was a kind of happiness that ordinary people couldn't understand.
They never cared about the strange looks of others; everyone was just passing by, and after death, they might still meet at a banquet.
...
The sun had risen from the east, reddening the clouds and emitting thousands of rays of light.
The championships were not over yet. Chen Xun and the big black ox slowly got up and walked in the direction of Qin Immortal Mountain.
They gradually moved further away from the countless cultivators who were still rushing over, leaving behind two ordinary figures, but under the shining sun, they seemed somewhat brilliant.
Qin Immortal Mountain, the home of Chen Xun and the big black ox.
"Old Ox, you go busy yourself first, I'll take a look at the Jade Spirit Scripture." Chen Xun leaned against the huge rock outside the cave, holding this auxiliary cultivation technique in his hands, "If it's useful, I'll learn it. If not, I'll take it to sell."
For this kind of cultivation technique, it can be replicated countless times, with not many confidentiality measures. However, the law cannot be passed on lightly, and it will always lead to many inexplicable troubles.
Before you knew it, enemies would come knocking on your door, saying that your disciple had caused trouble.
Or it could be caught by a major power, saying that you're wildly spreading the rare cultivation techniques we're selling, this immortal can't be cultivated anymore, go ascend.
And these things are all true events that happened in the cultivation world, all bloody lessons, just like the Nine Stars Valley booklet back then.
This can also be considered a hidden rule in the cultivation world. If you have good things, just keep them to yourself. Chen Xun just casually mentioned it, but he didn't dare to really take it out to sell again.
"Moo!" The big black ox hurriedly responded and dashed straight to the room. The spiritual herbs hadn't been attended to for several days.
Chen Xun's eyes fell into contemplation. They hadn't come into contact with any cultivation techniques, especially not such auxiliary ones.
From fantasizing about creating his own cultivation technique to now, nothing has been put into practice.
"Condensing twenty percent of the spiritual energy within the body, is it true or false? The spiritual energy in my body seems a bit different." Chen Xun propped his hand against his head and began to flip through it, "It's actually compressing the spiritual energy within the body's storage, increasing its concentration..."
No wonder it would cause difficulties with breakthroughs. With this route of spiritual energy operation, the person who created this technique could be considered a genius or a madman.
Chen Xun didn't even practice it, but instead began to study it, occasionally criticizing and commenting, completely different from most cultivators in the cultivation world.
When others obtained high-grade cultivation techniques, they were eager to practice them directly; the higher the quality, the better, without considering anything else.
Half a day passed, and Chen Xun had already grasped the route of the cultivation technique in his mind. A silver light emitted from his body, and his aura gradually became stronger.
He sat cross-legged next to the boulder, closing his eyes.
"Huh?!"
In just the time it took to drink a cup of tea, dust danced around Chen Xun, and he suddenly opened his eyes with a look of shock, "Auxiliary cultivation techniques also have spiritual energy enhancements?!"
"Moo moo?!!"
A cluster of spiritual energy points condensed, and the big black ox instantly appeared in front of Chen Xun; its eyes widened in shock. What happened to him?
"It's okay, Old Ox; we've encountered something good, haha."
"Moo~"
The big black ox breathed a sigh of relief and slowly ran back into the cave, looking happy and relaxed.
Chen Xun's face was full of joy, but he still couldn't believe it. According to reason, only spells had enhancements.
The cultivation techniques they practiced had never been considered spells; they were just a means of advancing their cultivation, step by step.
Chen Xun closed his eyes again and began to practice the Jade Spirit Scripture, feeling the enhancement of spiritual energy with this auxiliary cultivation technique.
Another half day passed.
The big black ox widened its eyes in front of the cave, and Chen Xun emitted a silver light all over his body. Five different colored spiritual energy chains hovered around him, enclosing him in a circle.
He was filled with a sense of charm, just like when he broke through to the Golden Core stage.
"Moo~!" The big black ox exhaled in shock, this was definitely Chen Xun's strongest state!
Although those geniuses from the sects were quite formidable, it would never doubt that if they provoked Big Brother Chen Xun, they would probably be slapped to death by him directly...
At this moment, a change was occurring in Chen Xun's body's spiritual energy, and a suppressed rumbling sound was emanating from the surroundings.
The earth, rocks, trees, streams, and even objects with fire attributes seemed to be emitting a low hum.
The big black ox's forehead kept sweating profusely, but a large formation had already been laid around, so there was no major disturbance. Everything was within controllable limits.
It stared at Chen Xun motionlessly, not moving anywhere. In case something happened, it could immediately go to help.
However, Chen Xun's expression was quite relaxed at the moment, like he had taken a pill, experiencing the wonderful feeling of cultivation improvement firsthand.
But they also had some drawbacks to taking pills, being unable to truly feel every step of the cultivation improvement process.
Chen Xun and the big black ox slowly consolidated their realms after taking the pills, relying on their feelings to discuss with each other, but it was still lacking.
However, this auxiliary cultivation technique finally solved this problem!
Chen Xun was still in a trance, showing no signs of waking up yet. The spiritual energy within him was slowly condensing, making the 'foundation' increasingly solid.
"Foundation Establishment stage, Core Formation stage, Golden Core stage, so that's how it is..."
Chen Xun kept repeating this sentence in a low murmur, and the aura around him became darker and darker.
