It was a long halberd of deep golden hue, with a crescent-shaped blade. The weapon stood much taller than Li Chengliao himself, its extravagant design exuding a sense of immense weight. Even Li Chengliao, with his Qi Cultivation Realm strength, struggled slightly to lift it.
Before he could say anything, Li Zhouwei's eyes had already lit up. Smiling, Li Chengliao propped the halberd against the ground and said, "This is an ancient Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, likely once used by an ancestor of our family. Its alignment with Bright Yang makes it a perfect match for you. What do you think?"
He placed the weapon carefully on the ground, ensuring it was stable before allowing Li Zhouwei to examine it closely. The boy ran his hands over the golden patterns on its surface, his excitement evident, "Father, this weapon is the right one!"
Li Chengliao nodded in satisfaction and explained, "This was retrieved by the Ancestor from a grotto heaven. No one in the family has ever been able to wield it. Even your Uncle Ximing, despite being a Bright Yang Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, failed to gain its recognition. It always felt a little off when he used it."
Li Chenliao elaborated, "Your uncle is not one to enjoy combat, he found it clumsy to wield. Thus, he left it in storage all these years, saving it for you."
Li Zhouwei couldn't hide his fondness for the weapon, his gaze lingering eagerly. Li Chengliao waited a moment before storing the weapon away and smiled, "You are still too young. For now, start practicing with a wooden halberd. I will assign an instructor to teach you."
The Li Family, with its vast resources, had no shortage of halberd users. Even Chen Mufeng in the main hall wielded a long halberd, while Xu Gongming from the Jade Court Guards favored a shorter one. Li Chengliao intended to gather them all to guide the child in his training.
"The only issue for now… is his eyes. For the moment, they remain manageable…" Li Chengliao muttered under his breath.
Li Zhouwei had been living on the mountain, rarely interacting with outsiders and only encountering close family members. Li Chengliao understood, however, that hiding the eyes indefinitely was impossible.
It's a pity that no matter what methods we've tried, we can't conceal them… After all, these are innate golden pupils! Li Chengliao lamented.
The Li Family had attempted illusions and other means to hide the golden pupils, but nothing worked. The golden hue persisted, glowing darkly, and they worried about damaging his eyes if they pushed too far. Reluctantly, they left them untouched.
Soon, someone arrived carrying a wooden halberd, specially made for Li Zhouwei. It stood taller than him by a full head and was crafted from an extraordinary type of wood, giving it a satisfying heft.
Li Chengliao handed it to him with a slight smile, patting the boy gently on the head, "Practice well."
Having always regarded the boy as mature beyond his years, this gesture of affection was uncharacteristic. As he pulled his hand back, he paused, momentarily startled by his own action.
Li Zhouwei's golden eyes shifted slightly, his small lips curling up ever so faintly into a rare smile before quickly returning to neutrality. "Yes, Father," he replied.
Eastern Sea, Golden Sack Island
Situ Mo, clad in golden armor, stood silently at the island's edge, his expression far from pleasant.
Since Mutuo's fall, he hadn't left the island in years, remaining stationed there. Even when news of Li Xuanfeng's actions in the southern border reached him, he stayed put, quietly maintaining his vigil.
Although visitors and guest cultivators came and went, and even members of the Situ Family occasionally arrived, no harm had come to them under his watch. Yet Situ Mo still refrained from stepping outside the formation.
Having witnessed Li Xuanfeng's prowess firsthand, he remained vigilant, ever expecting the man to catch him off guard. Unbeknownst to Situ Mo, Li Xuanfeng had entered a grotto heaven, and by lingering on the island, Situ Mo had missed a chance to return to the sect. Now, knowing Li Xuanfeng had left the southern border, he couldn't shake the paranoia that the famed Golden Bow lay hidden, waiting to strike near the island's formation.
"Still, it does not matter. The spiritual qi on this island is abundant enough. I can cultivate here without dealing with the sect's fools. It is not so bad," he thought.
Situ Mo carried deep grudges and a naturally cautious temperament. His decision to remain in seclusion was, therefore, hardly surprising. Fortunately, Kong Tingyun of Profound Peak Gate had been recalled to the sect to focus on her breakthrough, leaving him to contend with far less competent replacements from Profound Peak Gate.
However, these concerns weren't what truly weighed on Situ Mo's mind. Standing at the edge of the island for only a moment, he heard a loud laugh ring out. A figure cloaked in gold and crimson landed nearby, a booming voice following, "Sixteenth Brother! So, you have finally come out of seclusion! What good timing!"
Though he harbored immense disdain and hatred for the figure behind the voice, Situ Mo's face instantly lit up with a polite smile, his tone light and pleasant, "So it is Seventh Brother! Forgive me, I have been immersed in secluded cultivation and did not know you had arrived on the island. How remiss of me!"
The man beside him bore strikingly handsome features, with a high-bridged nose and flowing black-and-red robes. His face bore a slight resemblance to Situ Mo's, but his body was cloaked in rising flames entwined with wisps of black and red qi.
The flames extended down to his boots, manifesting as various avian shapes. This was none other than Situ Chen, whom Li Xuanfeng had encountered in the grotto heaven!
After emerging from the grotto heaven, Situ Chen had traveled to Golden Sack Island, both to recover and cultivate. Drawing strength from the Flameshadow Crow Qi, his movement seemed ethereal as he floated lightly to stand beside Situ Mo.
Situ Mo inclined his head slightly, smiling. "How did Seventh Brother fare in the grotto heaven?"
Situ Chen's expression soured instantly, his tone sharp and gloomy. "Unfortunately, Miao Ye and the others interfered. I gained nothing of value."
Following along with his brother's complaints, Situ Mo cursed a few words to appease him. Situ Chen's expression finally shifted from gloom to a smile, and he remarked, "You have truly been diligent, guarding this place for our main branch all these years. It must have been hard on you."
Situ Mo repeatedly expressed that he dared not claim credit, his face adorned with a respectful and humble smile. But inwardly, his heart was cold and venomous as he thought, Too bad you did not die in the grotto heaven. Your main branch caused my mother's death and now expects me to serve as your dog? How delusional.
The more he thought about it, the more his external smile became exceedingly sincere. He said warmly, "Since you are here, Seventh Brother, why not stay a little while? This is Scarlet Pristine Sea, and its scenery is entirely distinct from the rest of the Eastern Sea. To the north, you have the High Heavens Island, and to the south, the Qunyi Strait, each with unique views and treasures. You absolutely should not miss them!"
Situ Chen hadn't planned to linger and was preparing to return to the sect for cultivation. However, hearing this, his interest piqued. Seeing this, Situ Mo seized the opportunity, lavishly praising the richness of spirit treasures in the area before adding, "I will give Seventh Brother the best cave dwelling here! The concentration of spiritual qi rivals that of the sect itself. And beyond that, you can venture out to seek further opportunities. Why not make the most of it?"
Situ Chen, who wasn't interested in ordinary cultivation sites, had been waiting for precisely this kind of invitation. He laughed heartily, clearly tempted, and replied, "Then I will take you up on your offer, Sixteenth Brother!"
"Think nothing of it!" Situ Mo responded with hearty laughter, his expression glowing with warmth. Internally, he was laughing just as wildly, full of schemes.
Out loud, he added enthusiastically, "It is just that I am a bit lazy and was about to prepare for another secluded cultivation. If I may trouble you, Seventh Brother, could I ask you to oversee patrols of the surrounding sea regions?"
"Leave it to me!" Situ Chen, unaware of his brother's deep cunning, agreed readily and even with enthusiasm. Soon after, Situ Mo retreated, watching with satisfaction as his brother left the protective formation with a delighted expression. Slowly, Situ Mo turned and entered his cave dwelling at a measured pace.
The corners of his lips curled upward into a high smirk as he murmured to himself, "It would be best if you scouted out where Li Xuanfeng is hiding and got yourself shot to death by him—or better yet, both of you could inflict mutual damage. That way, I can return to the sect at my leisure!"
