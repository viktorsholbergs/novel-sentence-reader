Fei Tongyu crouched in deep thought, his heart racing. He was prepared for violence, but he had not expected Li Tongya to speak in such a warm voice.
"Brother Wangbai and I have been friends for many years… It's a shame to see him go. Watch over your clan well with your brother. If anyone from the minor sect dares to challenge you due to your youth and shallow cultivation, you can send someone to the southern shore to find me."
Although it sounded like advice from an elder, it also sounded like words deliberately spoken for Fei Wangjiang to hear. There was no demand or expectation of tributes. Instead, Li Tongya conveyed a genuine concern, leaving the two brothers momentarily stunned.
After saying that, Li Tongya rose gracefully from his seat.
"Now that this matter is settled, I'll take my leave."
"I…"
Fei Tongyu was at an utter loss for words, and he could not believe his ears. He paused, then dropped to his knees as he watched Li Tongya soar into the air.
"Thank you, Ancestor! Your kindness will be remembered by the Fei Family for generations…!" he cried out with great emotion in his voice.
The young man in white departed with his sword, leaving Fei Tongyu kneeling in gratitude. He glanced at his younger brother in relief and sighed deeply.
"I misjudged him with my narrow perspective," he said.
"Li Tongya… He remembers old favors and does not exploit others' vulnerabilities… Our family owes him a great debt now!" Fei Tongxiao's said as his voice quivered with emotion.
Fei Tongyu stood, dusting his knees. Hope flickered in his eyes again, and a smile spread across his face for the first time in months.
"Li Qinghong practiced spearmanship too… Back then, she never managed to learn a secret technique when she was training with our family. I guess I'll send over the Dragon Reflection manual to the Li Family in a few days, as a gesture of gratitude for his unexpected kindness..."
Fei Tongxiao's eyes flickered with a strange gleam as he nodded and said, "Yes. Unfortunately, our family is going through hardship now… We'll have to repay this debt slowly."
Beside them, Fei Wangjiang stood silently like a sturdy pine tree. Fei Tongxiao turned to him and respectfully asked, "Granduncle, do you still have Cold Pine Snow Qi at home?"
Fei Wangjiang gazed at him and replied warmly, "There's a portion left."
Sensing that Fei Tongxiao was up to something, Fei Tongyu quickly warned, "What are you up to? The Six White Jade Chakras you condensed through training the Long Brocade Heart Sutra during the Embryonic Breathing Realm stage are unique, you cannot just switch to another cultivation method!"
Fei Tongxiao's shook his head slowly, his gaze unwavering, his lips forming into a firm line before he spoke.
"I'll disperse my cultivation and start anew!"
────
Li Tongya rode the wind back to Mount Lijing. The sky was dark, and he swept his eyes over scattered lights in the town at the foot of the mountain before turning toward his cave dwelling.
The stone door of the cave was ajar. A young man clad in black sat cross-legged on the steps, waiting silently.
Li Tongya cleared his throat softly, rousing him from his reverie. Li Yuanjiao opened his eyes abruptly, freezing as he beheld the young man dressed in white before him. He had a handsome face with angular features and a pair of eyes that gleamed like bright stars as he stared intently at Li Yuanjiao.
After a few moments of silence, Li Yuanjiao asked hesitantly, "You're… the Old Ancestor?"
Li Tongya chuckled lightly and nodded.
"I have rescued the Fei Family and returned from the northern shore… Yu Xiaogui's Dao has been severed by me and he's in a critical condition. He's no longer a concern to us anymore."
"Old Ancestor! You've… recovered?!"
Li Yuanjiao's relief was evident in his eager gaze, but Li Tongya shook his head gently.
"With this victory, peace has returned to the lake. Fei Tongyu, though not as talented as Fei Wangbai, deeply acknowledges their debt to my family..." he began.
"Although Yu Mugao is cunning and shrewd, his talent is mediocre. With his reputation severely damaged and his actions becoming increasingly petty and unreasonable, the absence of Yu Xiaogui's influence will surely give him headaches."
Li Tongya's black hair fluttered in the breeze, lending him a carefree aura.
"The Yu Family lacks a capable successor. With you and Qinghong showing great promise in reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, in less than sixty years, our family will dominate this region."
Li Tongya's unusually talkative demeanor caused Li Yuanjiao to feel deeply uneasy. Nevertheless, Li Tongya gestured for him to join him, sitting together on the steps.
"Although Fei Wangbai has passed, the Fei Family still boasts nine Qi Cultivators. They are far stronger than our family and their Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation is extremely formidable. I fear that after my time, maintaining control may prove challenging, possibly reverting power back to the Yu Family… Hence, I did the Fei Family a favor, so that we can form alliances with them," Li Tongya explained patiently.
"The situation in this region fluctuates, determined not by immediate strength but by strategic maneuvers of multiple parties. If we seek to expand northward, we must navigate these dynamics carefully to avoid discord and unnecessary conflicts," he advised.
Li Yuanjiao understood this as he had the same discussion in detail with Li Tongya before. He nodded and replied, "Jiao'er understands…"
Li Tongya paused briefly before continuing, "To the north lies the Fei Family, to the east the Yu Family, and to the west a rogue Foundation Establishment cultivator named He. He may not meddle in worldly affairs and is focused solely on his cultivation, but we must remain vigilant."
"Understood," Li Yuanjiao replied as he nodded.
Li Tongya stood up with his sword in his arms and slowly ascended the steps.
"I will enter seclusion now. The cave door will remain tightly shut for the next five years," he announced.
With that, the ancient formation in the cave dwelling activated almost right away, and the moss-covered stone door began to close slowly.
Creak…
Li Yuanjiao raised his head and watched as Li Tongya retreated back into his cave dwelling. The stone door closed with a loud rumble while Li Tongya's warm voice echoed softly in the air.
"Do not forget the grievances of the clan."
Li Yuanjiao swung his sleeves and quickly fell to his knees, pressing his forehead to the ground three times in worship.
As the stone door finally slammed shut, only then did Li Yuanjiao slowly rise. With a solemn look on his face and slightly reddened eyes, he quietly swore, "Jiao dares not forget…"
Behind the closed door, Li Tongya paused briefly, listening to Li Yuanjiao's solemn affirmation.
He surveyed the neat and orderly cave dwelling before settling into his usual seat. Preparing some ink and a brush, he left a few writings on the stone table before moving to his bed and sat down cross-legged.
"The fox has wasted its efforts… The injury has already scattered my immortal foundation and severed my vitality."
Li Tongya gazed northward with a smile spreading across his handsome face. It was as if the past sixty years had left no trace upon him.
He continued, murmuring warmly, "For over seventy years, I've strived to lead the clan, quell external threats, and bring peace to Mount Yue... Now, I can die with dignity, feeling safe and content. My life has been one of profound contentment, with nothing more to desire."
He rested his chin on his hands and exhaled softly. His flowing black hair cascaded down his back, and the sparkle in his eyes slowly faded. The Qingche Sword in his arms let out a faint cry while Astral Qi within the cave surged, accompanied by gentle murmurs.
After the space of three breaths, a shiny white pill emerged before his body. It hovered briefly in the air before vanishing into the void.
His face retained its youthful appearance from when he was sixteen, his white clothes pristine without a single crease on it. He smiled with his eyes closed as if he were only deep in thought.
Rumble!
The sound of running rivers filled the void. Dewdrops seeped from the cave floor, creating a tinkling spring-like melody. The howling of the winter wind grew louder but the cave dwelling remained tightly sealed.
The energy of his Boundless Ocean caused a phenomenon atop Mount Lijing. The once clear sky quickly darkened with clouds as thunder rumbled, and light rain began to drizzle across the earth.
"It's raining!"
Fine autumn drizzle blanketed Lijing Town. Farmers raised their heads to welcome the refreshing shower while vendors covered their carts with umbrellas, and the carriages of prominent families rolled leisurely through the streets.
The stone paths on the streets at the foot of the mountain grew slick with rain. Dogs barked softly, children played and laughed, and a newlywed woman deliberated over spending a copper coin to buy fabric for a new dress.
Li Tongya passed silently in the cave dwelling. His immortal foundation had crumbled, his vitality spent. Yet to the world outside the cave, the weather was merely a little cold today but the gentle rain was soothing and pleasant.
Such refreshing autumn rain was a rare delight indeed.
