The number of figures on the mountain increased steadily. Besides a few familiar faces and recognizable Daoist robes, there were many in unfamiliar attire—likely cultivators from Wu State or the northern regions—each standing silently amidst the clouds.
After a few moments, a figure finally stepped forward from the crowd. He appeared young, dressed in white robes embroidered with faint gold patterns at the cuffs, and carried no visible weapons. With a calm demeanor, he cupped his fist and surveyed the gathered crowd before speaking softly, "Standing idly gains us nothing. Whatever we aim to contend for, the first step is to break this formation. I am Nian Yi of the Yue Cultivating Sect. If there are no objections, let us of the upper sects organize and open the formation."
His mastery of flight techniques was evident. Despite the tumultuous presence of Heavy Abyssal Gale in the sky, he remained suspended mid-air, though unable to move freely. This subtle display of control over the wind immediately set him apart.
The reputation of the Yue Cultivation Sect preceded him, standing high among the immortal sects. His words carried weight, and none dared openly challenge him. Most exchanged glances or gazed downward, remaining silent.
Moments later, a middle-aged man descended from the clouds. He wore simple attire, with a long blade strapped to his back. Standing with arms crossed, he said plainly, "Zhang Yun of the Golden Feather Sect."
His aura was serene, unshakable like a still lake, yet it caused the crowd to steal nervous glances. Even Nian Yi was visibly surprised. He quickly bowed with a cupped fist and said, "I did not expect the senior himself to arrive. Forgive me for my impoliteness."
Zhang Yun waved dismissively. Below, two figures rose from the clouds—the black-and-gold robed man and Yu Muxian—coming to stand nearby. A deep voice announced, "Azure Pond Sect, Yuanwu Peak. Tang Shedu and Yu Muxian."
The participation of Yue State's three great sects was now apparent. However, no overseas cultivators made a move. Then, a man in green-gray robes with a jade crown and handsome features ascended into the air and stood amidst the clouds, "Qing Zhuo of Mount Changhuai, Wu State."
Nian Yi and Zhang Yun showed no surprise at his arrival, as though it was expected. Qing Zhuo, however, swept his gaze over the crowd below before speaking in a gentle yet commanding tone, "The Dao lineage of the Green Pine Temple spreads across Wu and Yue. It is only right for us to claim the treasures of this hall. As for the Jiangbei and overseas cultivators, I suggest you disperse to the outer clouds—perhaps fortune will smile upon you there."
The announcement sparked mixed reactions among those below. Some faces brightened, while others grew grim. Li Xuanfeng briefly glanced at Lin Chensheng and Bi Yuzhuang, noting their lack of surprise. He thought to himself, The Daoist Masters of Jiangnan have already divided things among themselves. This is no different from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven years ago. That one even had Daoist Masters present, making the process even stricter.
The three great sects, all part of Golden Core Dao lineages, along with Mount Changhuai, commanded authority. Many Eastern Sea cultivators took the hint, rising into the air and dispersing across the skies. Seven or eight out of ten departed, leaving only two individuals still lingering.
Qing Zhuo cast them a glance. One of them, seemingly nervous, stepped forward and began, "I am of the Chunyi Dao—"
Before he could finish, Qing Zhuo frowned slightly and cut him off with an impatient expression. He said nothing further but turned respectfully toward Zhang Yun and remarked, "I thought the senior had already secluded himself to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. I did not expect him to personally come to this grotto heaven."
Zhang Yun shook his head lightly without elaborating. Qing Zhuo then took out a token from his robes.
The token, made of green-gray jade, bore three ancient characters. Though it seemed unremarkable at first glance, Li Xuanfeng used his perception technique to focus on it. For an instant, the characters on the token became clear—Qing Changhuai.
The history-rich Yi Mountain City provided ample exposure to ancient texts and scripts. Li Xuanfeng instantly recognized the near-archaic writing style.
As the token glimmered faintly, the grand formation brightened briefly, then silently vanished. No dazzling explosions or defenses emerged; the formation simply dissipated in full view of the gathered cultivators.
The token of Mount Changhuai is actually… capable of undoing this formation… Li Xuangfeng thought in shock.
As soon as the grand formation was broken, before anyone could act, beams of light erupted in all directions. The figure seated cross-legged began to convulse violently, and a crystalline pale-blue sword burst out from their chest, like a ferocious falcon, shooting into the skies above.
The figure's remains instantly turned to ash, scattering into golden light that transformed midair into flocks of golden sparrows. The sparrows fluttered their wings with lifelike vigor, chirping melodiously as they darted in all directions.
Meanwhile, the figure reaching for the jade box collapsed with a dull thud, their entire body disintegrating into a wave of red heat. Their chest and abdomen exploded in two fiery bursts of crimson light, scattering large and small red jade beads that rolled across the hall's floor.
The six jade boxes on the platforms began to tremble, the sound of their shifting filling the air. Meanwhile, the scattered dharma artifacts and books on the meditation mats began to stir, some awkwardly propping themselves up before soaring away on the wind.
In an instant, beams of light filled the hall, creating a spectacular sight. Lin Chensheng's black robes fluttered as he, having already chosen his target, leaped toward the fourth meditation mat with swift precision.
The colorful light within the hall surged forth, seemingly unaffected by the Heavy Abyssal Gale outside. Several ancient texts flipped open their pages as they shot into the air with astonishing speed.
Before anyone could speak, a chaotic skirmish broke out. Among the dharma artifacts soaring through the air, a small mirror stood out, only palm-sized but radiating a striking violet-gold brilliance. It immediately drew everyone's attention.
Several cultivators took to the skies, reaching for the artifact, only for a golden hammer to come crashing down in their midst.
"This belongs to me!" A black-clad cultivator wielding a long hammer charged forward with commanding presence. His mastery of wind-riding techniques allowed him to ascend high into the air, where he hovered over the fray. The power of his dharma artifact forced two opponents to retreat instantly.
With his other hand, he conjured a wave of gray flames that swept outward, sending several adversaries scurrying back. With a swift incantation and release, he seized the violet-gold mirror with ease.
This act of audacity enraged the crowd. Within moments, five or six spells were launched toward the black-clad man. Instead of retreating, he surged forward, boldly flying straight into the great hall.
While the battle outside reached a fevered pitch, Zhang Yun and the other elite cultivators refrained from remaining outside. They entered the hall together, moving in unison, and the rest dared not follow. Now, the bold intrusion of the black-clad cultivator caused a brief hesitation among those outside.
Li Xuanfeng, however, paid little attention to the wider conflict. Fixing his gaze on a nearby dharma manual, he seized his opportunity.
Boom!
With a thunderous stomp, he propelled himself five zhang into the air without invoking wind-riding techniques, snatching the dharma manual mid-air with a single, decisive motion.
Around him, the others had already pursued their own targets, leaving an unoccupied patch of space. No one contested him, and the dharma manual was unexpectedly easy to grab.
Easier than I expected… Just as that thought crossed his mind, Li Xuanfeng realized that the truly valuable items in the hall were the remaining five jade boxes. The dharma artifacts and ancient texts scattered across the mats were little more than remnants left behind, their prolonged exposure to the grand formation merely granting them a faint semblance of sentience.
