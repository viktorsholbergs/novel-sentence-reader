Kobdarok’s Ambition
* * *
After laughing for a while, ‘Kobdarok, the Black Rock’, the Clan Chief of the Black Kobu Tribe, looked around the battlefield at the bottom of the giant hole.
The tide of the battle had turned.
Only a handful of Red Kobu warriors were still resisting.
<<<Guh… aaaaah…>>>
Another surviving Red Kobu warrior collapsed, throwing himself to the bottom of the giant hole.
The ground shook from the impact, with a thud.
<<<W-We did it! We wooooon!!>>>
Young Black Kobu warriors, standing next to the corpse of the Red Kobu warrior, raised a victory cry.
But this victory was not easily won.
Around the corpse of a single Red Kobu warrior, the corpses of dozens of Black Kobu warriors were piled up.
In other words, to defeat a single skilled Red Kobu warrior, the Black Kobu Tribe has paid a price dozens of times greater… and the Black Kobu warriors, who were originally overwhelming in number, have now been significantly reduced.
Calmly thinking about it, this should be a critical situation for the Black Kobu Tribe as well.
With this number of warriors, it might even be difficult to protect their village from attacks by dangerous creatures like wild sharks.
<<<Guhoho…! Guhohoho…! >>>
And yet, Kobdarok, laughing in satisfaction, narrowed his eyes and nodded.
He looked abnormal, seemingly even rejoicing in the death of warriors from his own tribe.
<<<You bastard… why are you laughing…! A lot of your own warriors died too…! >>>
A voice flew at Kobdarok from the ground.
Glancing down, the source of the voice was the battered Kobdalian.
This young one, weakly thrashing, but still with fighting spirit burning in his eyes, glared at Kobdarok.
<<<Guhoh? You want to know? Well, I’ll tell you! I’m in a good mood right now!>>>
Kobdarok said that, and slowly descended, grinning…
<<<You Red Kobu warriors, Black Kobu warriors, Blue Kobu warriors… none of your deaths will be in vain.>>>
He reached right above Kobdalian…
<<<Because all of your corpses… will become sacrifices… for Calamity Humidafai!>>>
…And stepped on Kobdalian, as if to crush him with his huge belly!
<<<Guuaaaahーーー!!>>>
Kobdalian screamed at the sheer weight!
<<<Humidafai, for the past 5,000 years, has been sealed and unable to move, sustaining its life by sucking mana flowing deep within the earth! In fact, the fog of the Eserem Sea of Fog is a byproduct… or rather, its excrement!>>>
Kobdarok hopped on top of Kobdalian, laughing gleefully.
Even when he heard Kobdalian’s screams and the creaking of his body, he showed no hesitation.
<<<However, it’s a creature that originally grows by eating plants and meat! In other words, it’s starving! It’s starving to death!>>>
From afar, it just looks like a big fish jumping around happily, but up close, the reality is gruesome.
Kobdalian, continuously trampled, could no longer scream, and just gritted his teeth, enduring Kobdarok’s violence.
<<<In that state, even a Calamity can’t move! So, sacrifices are necessary! I’m sure Humidafai will be satisfied with well-built warriors like you!>>>
Seeing that Kobdalian was completely exhausted, Kobdarok finally stopped trampling him.
And then, he looked around.
The battle was over.
The only ones swimming in the air are those who surrendered to Kobdarok.
<<<Guhohohohoーーー!!>>>
Kobdarok laughed triumphantly, enjoying himself.
<<<Now then, young one… did you know? That the Sea… actually exists? >>>
Kobdarok descended next to Kobdalian again, and whispered that to Kobdalian, who could no longer even thrash.
Hearing that, Kobdalian’s eyes widened, speechless.
For the Flying Kobudai clans who live in the Eserem Sea of Fog, the Sea is a mythical existence.
A large, beautiful, bountiful world.
A legendary world, without hunger or conflict.
That’s what the Sea is to them.
<<<I will use the power of Humidafai… to make everything mine!! The Continent!! The Sea!! Everything!!>>>
Kobdarok declared that loudly, and then, this time, he swam leisurely towards Humidafai…
<<<Now, awaken, Humidafai!! I’ve prepared breakfast for you!! Guhohohohoーーー!!>>>
…And after laughing loudly, he bit into the white, glowing starfish clinging to Humidafai’s shell.
<<<Devour… everythingーーー!!!>>>
He ripped the starfish off of Humidafai!
The next moment!
The cloth and ropes that bound Humidafai glowed brightly, and then were sucked into the starfish that Kobdarok was holding…
…And nothing was left to restrain the super giant turban shell.
And after a beat…
Zuz… zuzuzuzu…
With an eerie sound…
The entire bottom of the Eserem Sea of Fog… started shaking violently!!
