Mitran and Emi
* * *
When he opened his eyes—
“…Huh?”
Mitran was lying on a thin futon.
It’s a clearly cheap futon, with a rough texture.
The hem is frayed, and it smells musty. It’s definitely made of a cheap material.
“…………”
Mitran relaxed, lay on his back on the futon, and stared at the ceiling.
It’s a circular ceiling.
A radial framework extends towards the center, supported by pillars at key points.
What’s covering the framework is cloth.
They’re dimly lit by small magic lamps.
The place Mitran is currently lying in is a pretty impressive tent.
In other words, Mitran was carried here… after losing consciousness in the fight with Emi.
He doesn’t know exactly where he is, but it’s probably one of the settlements scattered throughout the western desert.
This tent Mitran was sleeping in is quite grand, and clearly not Harishurap’s portable tent.
He can also tell that from the carpet laid on the floor.
It’s a carpet with a pattern he’s never seen before.
“Ah…”
Mitran, staring at the carpet pattern with his still hazy mind, then noticed Leseida sleeping right next to him.
She’s frowning in her sleep, clutching Mitran’s futon tightly.
He must have made her worry.
Mitran felt apologetic.
Beside them, Harishurap, sitting cross-legged, was dozing off.
Mitran can only see his back, so he can’t see his expression, but… the tip of a spear is sticking out from around Harishurap’s right shoulder.
He must have been keeping watch, holding the spear.
And the target of his vigilance is probably the person lying on a futon placed quite far from them.
However.
“She’s not here…?”
No one is lying on the futon.
Mitran sat up and put his hand on the empty futon.
…It’s still warm.
“Emi-chan…?”
Mitran was certain that the owner of the futon was Emi.
But he was worried that she wasn’t there.
He grabbed the coat hanging on the pillar, put it on, and left the tent, filled with warm air.
* * *
“Fiih…”
Mitran, stepping out of the tent, shivered at the cold and exhaled a white breath.
Looking around, he sees several tents and a large lake nearby.
It’s sparkling, reflecting the stars still twinkling in the sky.
On the other hand, if he looks at the opposite side of the lake, there’s the familiar desert.
The sand, which shines white during the day, is now jet-black, with the sun not yet fully risen.
That jet-black desert continues endlessly to the horizon.
And on the horizon, you can see a bright red line.
The sun is about to rise.
“Ah…”
Mitran, momentarily mesmerized by the sight, then noticed a small figure walking towards the desert, and involuntarily let out a voice.
And he hurriedly ran towards the figure.
“Emi-chan!”
He called out the person’s name.
“…………”
Emi, called by her name… slowly turned around, looking reluctant.
Her expression is the same as when Mitran met her in the ruins, unreadable and expressionless.
At least, she doesn’t seem to welcome Mitran’s call.
“Emi-chan, where are you going!? Are you okay!? Are you hurt anywhere!?”
But Mitran didn’t care.
Mitran was worried.
And a little angry.
Emi had lost consciousness and gone on a rampage.
And yet, she’s trying to leave without a word, right after that!
“Don’t come any closer.”
But Emi’s response to Mitran’s concern was a word of rejection.
And 【Intimidation】.
An intense killing intent rooted Mitran to the spot.
“I know I’m being ungrateful. I’m sorry.”
Even while emitting that 【Intimidation】… Emi apologized to Mitran.
At the same time, her stomach growled—Gugyurururu.
“But I’m leaving. I’m hungry.”
“…If it’s food! You can eat breakfast with everyone…!”
Mitran desperately shouted at Emi, who had turned her back to him again and was about to walk into the desert.
“…………”
Emi flinched at his words, stopped… and looked back at Mitran.
And the next moment!
“!?”
Mitran gasped in surprise, noticing something rough and cold wrapped around his neck.
It’s a tentacle.
The tentacles that Emi had been sprouting from her body during her rampage are now extending from the sand at Mitran’s feet, wrapped around his neck.
“…I’m hungry.”
Emi slowly repeated the same words as before to Mitran, who couldn’t speak.
“You all… look like meat to me.”
And she stared at Mitran’s eyes with a cold gaze.
“A-Uu…”
The tentacle wrapped around Mitran’s neck gradually tightened…
Mitran, letting out a choked cry, struggled and squirmed, but couldn’t resist.
And then…
He was suddenly released.
The tentacle suddenly turned into mist and disappeared, and Mitran fell back on his rear—Thud.
“You can hate me.”
Emi spoke flatly to Mitran, who was breathing heavily, his face pale.
“But let me… remain ‘human’…”
Expressionless, her voice monotone and quiet.
“…………!!”
Mitran—.
Mitran was sad.
Because he had touched… a part of Emi’s heart, hidden behind her expressionless, doll-like beauty.
He understood.
Emi doesn’t want to be hated.
She doesn’t want to be alone.
But her instincts still crave flesh.
She probably can’t… live with people right now.
He understood that.
Large tears spilled from Mitran’s eyes.
But.
Mitran wiped away his tears and stood up abruptly!
“Emi-chan!!”
And he shouted at Emi, who was walking towards the desert!
“Goodbye for now!! But!!”
Even if she couldn’t see him!
He forced a smile and shouted!
“…See you later!!!”
“…………!!”
Emi didn’t respond to Mitran’s words.
But she stopped… and her body trembled slightly.
And then.
Emi started running, as if escaping.
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
And then, she jumped high.
Jet-black wings sprouted from her back, and catching the wind, she started flying.
Emi, flying straight, straight into the desert sky.
Quickly disappeared from Mitran’s sight.
The navy blue desert sky gradually started to turn yellow from the horizon.
A new day is about to begin.
You couldn’t say thank you, could you, Emi-chan?
And Mitran-kun is incredibly kind.
Anyway, once I write a few more epilogue chapters, Arc 26 will be over.
Please bear with me a little longer.
