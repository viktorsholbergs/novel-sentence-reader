Murong Xia sat casually on a wooden chair on the mountain, smiling at the crowd. His gaze lingered on Li Qinghong for a moment before he spoke.
"My Murong Family cultivates orthodox devil Dao that has ancient roots. Cultivators nurture a Euphoria Head within their stomach for cultivation. This is the most orthodox form of devil cultivation, even a Maha or Dharma Master would find no fault with it."
He paused, observing Li Qinghong's shaking of her head, and continued softly, "You all know the state of this world. Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivators grow people for consumption, and the Maha and Dharma Masters cycle through endless reincarnations. For mortals, life is nothing but suffering… something that is worse than death. It would be better for them to be consumed by me."
Li Qinghong sneered and retorted bluntly, "It is precisely because of people like you, who consume humans, that mortals endure a fate worse than death. It's not that life is so unbearable that being devoured would be a preferable option. Fellow Daoist, isn't it rather excessive to twist reality for the sake of self-deception?"
Murong Xia raised his eyebrows and said earnestly, "Not at all. Devil cultivation is about saving all beings. My Murong Family cultivates the Euphoria Realm precisely for this reason… Without it, we would not consume humans."
He paused again, looked at the crowd, and continued calmly, "Within the Euphoria Head lies the Euphoria Realm. There are fine wines, exquisite delicacies, luxurious clothing, and untold riches, where men and women indulge without the burdens of life and death, free from the worries of conflict and torment… Endless pleasure and happiness await within. Those consumed by me enter this realm, shedding their mortal flesh to become immortal souls. As long as I, Murong Xia, continue my cultivation, they will revel in eternal delights. Isn't that wonderful?"
His words were like a stone thrown into a lake, causing everyone to look at each other in astonishment and rendering Li Qinghong momentarily speechless.
Murong Xia sighed and shook his head, continuing, "We are compassionate. The devil sect is benevolent. When devil cultivators fight, the victor gathers the souls of the defeated into their realm, where they enjoy eternal pleasures. If everyone practiced devil cultivation, only cultivators would suffer while mortals would enjoy eternal bliss in this sacred land of eternal joy!"
Murong Xia's face showed compassion, and a faint halo of light appeared behind his head.
Li Yuanjiao frowned and said, "This is just your claim. Who knows if you consume people or gather their souls? If it is truly a virtuous deed, why does your devil form take on such a grotesque and gory appearance, and why does the world detest cultivators like you?"
Murong Xia laughed and waved his hand dismissively. The sound of the breeze, accompanied by the sounds of music and the laughter of men, women, and children, came from his stomach.
Before them appeared a green soul, bowing respectfully and saying, "Greetings immortal masters, I am Cao Yangxuan, a resident of the town at the base of Mount Yuting."
Li Yuanjiao and the others were taken aback. The town's head, who was Li Yuanjiao's concubine-born younger brother, stepped forward and conversed briefly with the soul. Shortly after, he returned, saying, "Family Head, I know that person. His voice and appearance are exactly as they were when he was still alive."
Murong Xia laughed heartily. The devil soul kneeled with a thud and said, "We are grateful for all that the clan has done for us. It's a great kindness that we could never repay, not even in ten lifetimes. Now that I have been enlightened by the Master Monk and achieved eternal bliss, I come with one request..."
Li Yuanjiao felt a sense of foreboding and asked, "Speak."
The devil soul bowed respectfully and replied, "At the entrance of the village is an old farmer named Cao Ye, my father. We lived in hardship. Now that I have received this great opportunity, I hope the Family Head can bring my father here, cleanse him thoroughly, and let this Master Monk consume him so that we can reunite in bliss and enjoy eternal happiness together..."
"Absurd!"
Before Li Yuanjiao could even respond, Li Qinghong, unable to listen any longer, frowned and spat out a bolt of thunder, interrupting the spell. The devil soul, already a remnant soul, was instantly destroyed by the thunder.
Murong Xia was furious and cursed, "What a cruel woman! What a vicious heart!"
Li Qinghong, feeling a tinge of guilt as she watched the soul dissipate, raised her eyebrows and retorted sharply, "Your entire cultivation is based on falsehood. Your so-called land of bliss is just an illusion!"
"Illusion?" Murong Xia sneered and replied, "What right do you have to decide for others? Go ask the mortals if they prefer to continue struggling in this world or enter my so-called illusory Euphoria Realm?"
Turning away from Li Qinghong, Murong Xia addressed Li Yuanjiao, "As for the Family Head's claim that our devil Dao is grotesque and detestable, it is because we conceal our utmost kindness and beauty within our bellies, using our outward appearance to bear the blame. The elders of my family are all good people who could discuss Dao with the Mahas and Dharma Masters."
Murong Xia's voice echoed through the courtyard, and he continued through gritted teeth, "In my humble opinion, it is the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivators who are truly selfish and self-serving! They appear ethereal and transcendent, but seek only personal transcendence… regarding all other beings as mere ants. That, I argue, is the true essence of the devil Dao! We may appear hideous and act outrageously, but at our core, we are the genuine immortal cultivators!"
"Heh!" Li Qinghong was both amused and angered. Many of the one hundred and fifteen corpses had not yet cooled, and the dismembered limbs and blood still painted the town red. Yet, this devil cultivator had the gall to accuse them of such atrocities. She coldly replied, "Our Daos are fundamentally different!"
The old monk shook his head and patted his belly as he laughed. "Either we fight it out, or you let me go. Family Head, you must decide wisely!"
The tension in the courtyard rose. Li Yuanjiao stroked the hilt of his sword quietly, listening intently to something. After a moment, he exhaled deeply and waved his hand.
"Please leave, fellow Daoist. Do not come to our territory to consume humans again. If this happens again, you won't escape so easily."
"Thank you, Family Head!" Murong Xia cupped his fists and strode out of the courtyard, flying away on the wind.
Tian Youdao and the others glanced at the siblings and wisely withdrew. Li Qinghong smoothed her hair and sat down to the side, laughing.
"That old fellow, claiming that his family elders are cultured and that they are true immortal cultivators inside, is clearly afraid!"
Li Yuanjiao still held the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword and replied, "Who would not be? It is like poking a wolf with a stick; both sides are scared. He fears our reputation as sword immortals, but we have never fought devil cultivators and are just as nervous. That old fellow appears to be only at the seventh or eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, but he has cultivated something so sinister that his strength must be at the Foundation Establishment Realm. This is the first time such a powerful cultivator has come to our territory."
The two exchanged a glance, avoiding the topic of the hundred-odd innocent deaths. Li Yuanjiao sighed softly and said, "We can only do what we can. Driving him away is the best outcome. There are more and more devil cultivators in Jiangnan these days… Peaceful days will be hard to come by."
Li Qinghong nodded slightly and asked, "The devil plague in Yue State... Did Sister-In-Law get any news from the Xiao Family?"
