In the room, Chen Xun and the big black ox were so excited that they were about to faint, but they didn't rush. It wasn't the highest bid yet.
"Old ox, let's go for a million spirit stones; no rush." Chen Xun's chest was heaving, his gaze firmly fixed on the Night White Mushroom.
In recent years, although they had earned few spirit stones, they had accumulated over six hundred thousand, plus what they had saved before was already over a million.
"Moo!" The big black ox kept snorting, showing that they shouldn't panic.
"Hehe, as long as we have enough time, we'll always come across." Chen Xun calmly took a sip of health-preserving tea. "If we can't get it with a million, there's no need to stay in Yuxu City."
"Moo?"
"Let's go rob."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded solemnly. The boss's words always made sense.
On the auction stage, the old man remained calm and composed: "A friend has already bid up to one hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones."
"One hundred and ten thousand."
"One hundred and twenty thousand."
Everyone in the room understood that such rare items were priceless. While spirit stones were easy to come by, spirit medicine was hard to find!
The current price is already astronomical. Ordinary cultivators wouldn't even dare think about it outside.
"One hundred and thirty-five thousand."
The bidding frequency was slowing down. It had already exceeded the psychological expectations of many cultivators.
This kind of rare spirit medicine was not lacking in the Top Ten Sects or among Golden Core cultivators. Most of the bidders were ordinary sect cultivators.
"One hundred and forty thousand."
The price continued to rise. Many people were already frowning. A seven-hundred-year-old spirit medicine wasn't worth fighting for with a fortune.
But for Chen Xun and the big black ox, it was different. They dared to directly compete with a million spirit stones.
Even if this herb was only a hundred years old, it wouldn't make much difference to them.
"One hundred and forty-seven thousand."
"One hundred and fifty thousand! Any friend wants to bid higher?"
The old man's eyes also flashed with surprise. Such a high price hadn't been seen for a non-millennial spirit medicine in a long time.
Bang!
With a final hammer strike, the Night White Mushroom was sold.
Inside the room, two earth-shaking roars rang out.
"It's ours!" Chen Xun slammed his cup on the table. "It's been hundreds of years! I can't remember!"
"Moo!"
The big black ox's eyes were filled with excitement. They finally got what they had been waiting for. The gods and immortals were indeed blessing them.
After handing over the spirit stones, the Night White Mushroom was also sent over.
Chen Xun and the big black ox played with it for a long time, reluctant to let go. Finally, they carefully placed it back in the medicine box and had the big black ox hide it in the storage room.
"Old ox, don't worry, there's still the Yu Chen Grass. Maybe it'll come up next." Chen Xun grinned. If not for the prohibition against using spiritual energy here, he would have thanked the heavens profusely. "Stay calm, we can wait!"
The big black ox turned his head slowly. The two exchanged a glance, their understanding evident without words.
Half a day later, two figures fled in a hurry. They stood outside the hall, the saliva still not spat out. After all, they had gotten the Night White Mushroom.
However, the Yu Chen Grass did not appear. They could only reluctantly return home and wait for the next centennial event.
The bustling noise inside and outside the city continued, and the sky occasionally resounded with shocking noises.
Chen Xun, accompanied by the big black ox, renewed their subscription to the Cultivation Pavilion for another two hundred years. The receptionist was shocked. Why would a Golden Core cultivator stay in a Yellow-grade cave?
But he didn't dare to question and could only respectfully handle the formalities for Chen Xun. He also mentioned:
"Senior, you can move into a lower-ranked cave." But Chen Xun declined, saying he had gotten used to living here. Qin Immortal Mountain was quite nice. He also mentioned that he would invite some friends over in the future.
â€¦
The first thing they did after returning home was to hold a ceremony. A large number of Crane Spirit Trees were placed everywhere, showing their piety.
It took half an hour before they stopped, having thanked the heavens sincerely and without any ulterior motives.
"Old ox, our own spiritual treasures should be reaching their peak soon." Chen Xun smiled faintly. "When the time comes, let's open a talisman shop at the foot of the mountain and become bosses."
"Moo?!" The big black ox was shocked.
Was Chen Xun finally going to learn talisman making?
Once all their strengths were at their peak, were they just going to stay home? They would definitely come back when it was time to rest.
Chen Xun chuckled, "I asked around. If we open a shop, we can get materials at a cheaper price, you know?"
"Moo~~" The big black ox's eyes widened. It had been a long time since they last opened a shop.
"It's time to enjoy ourselves a bit and then wait for the Yu Chen Grass."
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox had no objections. Whatever Chen Xun said, he would do. It was enough for him to follow along.
"Old ox, you go cultivate the Night White Mushroom, and I'll think about the plan."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded in agreement and hurried to the beast room in the cave. That underground place was their secret base.
Chen Xun lay directly on the ground, gently closing his eyes, enjoying the days unaffected by time.
After resting for a few days, they became busy again.
The Night White Mushroom began to be cultivated endlessly. Chen Xun's axe skills didn't lag behind either. He practiced and comprehended day after day, never uttering a word of exhaustion.
The flowers and plants outside the cave continued to grow, wither, and bloom again, year after year. Only the Crane Spirit Trees and the two immortals remained constant.
As the years passed, another fifty years flew by, and Chen Xun and the big black ox descended the mountain.
In a remote place below Qin Immortal Mountain, they bought a shop. Others didn't even bother with the better locations.
It was completely tucked away in an alley, quite peaceful, but with a surprisingly wide view. Only a few cultivators passed by.
Chen Xun planted two Crane Spirit Trees outside the shop, while the big black ox often studied some formation books bought from the backyard.
He set up a rocking chair and became the guardian of the door, basking in the sun, holding a book of talismans.
They also stocked up on a lot of goods, such as demon beast flesh and blood, yellow paper cinnabar, which he said were cheaper than others' prices.
However, the items in the shop were quite rough, with no good finished products, and the cultivators who came shook their heads.
Chen Xun's revealed cultivation was only in the early Foundation Establishment stage, not attracting any attention.
The shop was only open for half a day, and Chen Xun was already frustrated. His skills were lacking, and he couldn't sell anything. He had to practice more.
Another fifty years passed, and it was another spring. Yuxu City became lively again.
Cultivators were coming and going everywhere; even the back alleys were busier. Chen Xun smiled as he watched them, still lying on the rocking chair.
But business here remained dismal. The items were too low-end, and the location was remote.
He sighed lightly as he looked up at the sky, remembering the days when he used to forge iron in Panning City. He used to be a blacksmith shop owner after all.
"Unknowingly, so many years have passed." Chen Xun smiled faintly, "Old Sun, the old ox, and I have opened a shop in the cultivation world..."
The spring breeze blew gently, bringing a refreshing feeling. The two Crane Spirit Trees nearby emitted a pleasant rustling sound.
Everywhere was full of vitality, whether it was the scenery or the cultivators.
It was said that the revival of all things was the miracle of nature, but Chen Xun and the big black ox seemed to have never encountered any miracles.
Perhaps those miracles that had appeared before were no longer worth mentioning in front of the immortals...
A green leaf quietly fell on Chen Xun's face, but he continued to smile. He placed the book on his chest and slowly closed his eyes.
Between the sky and earth, everything was picturesque, with blue skies, white clouds, a sunset glow, and perfect sunlight.
It was as if he was reminiscing. After so many years, despite encountering many unpleasant things, it was all ultimately beautiful.
Those people and those things were vividly depicted in his mind, never forgotten. A faint smile unknowingly appeared at the corner of his mouth.
Chen Xun vaguely understood that the beauty of all things was because it allowed one's state of mind to flourish in this moment.
The gentle spring breeze continued to blow, and the pages of the book on Chen Xun's chest turned softly.
With the spring breeze, it seemed as if an old friend had arrived.
A woman dressed elegantly suddenly appeared at the corner of the street. Her face was cold, and she had been standing there for a long time.
Finally, a smile appeared on her face that seemed to have not smiled for a long time, and she began to walk towards Chen Xun's shop, step by step.
