Mount Qingdu.
Li Ximing left his courtyard for once and stood on the green altar with Li Xijun. He still did not dare to face his father, Li Yuanping, and kept his gaze lowered in silence.
Li Yuanjiao had just slaughtered the two demon creatures with the jade knife. He waited quietly until the auras of the two on the altar surged and only let out a sigh of relief when they finally sat down, cross-legged.
After all, the immortal mirror talisman was the one choosing its recipient. The two Foundation Establishment Realm monsters would be wasted if no talisman qi were provided. There were still more than ten Talisman Pills at home, which was enough to last them for now.
The Talisman Pills have the ability to aid in breaking through realms… Though not as effective for the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators as Qi Cultivators, they could be taken when breaking through to the late stage. When the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill can be refined, the chances of reaching the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm will be greatly increased, and the process will be significantly expedited.
Li Yuanjiao mused to himself as he waited.
After meditating for a while, Li Xijun took a deep breath and opened his eyes first.
His eyebrows were sharp, highlighting the depth and intensity of his handsome eyes. Surrounded by a white mist, he exhaled a breath of white qi before standing up, announcing respectfully, "I have obtained Radiant Snow Pine Ridge and broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm!"
He paused, his demeanor calmer than before he received the talisman. Any hint of arrogance had faded, leaving a more composed and stable presence.
"With this talisman, my heart is as still as water, dispelling illusions and discerning details. My true essence and mana are like frost and snow, allowing me to cultivate twice as effectively even with only half the effort."
Smiling and nodding, Li Yuanjiao looked at him with approval.
Meanwhile, Li Ximing radiated golden-red light which circulated between his Shenyang Mansion and Juque Court. He opened his eyes and murmured softly, "I have broken through to the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Layer and obtained Valley Wind Leading Fire, which could use fire to attract qi and refine true essence."
He briefly introduced the skill and added with some surprise, "Not only did I break through, but I also acquired Pheasant Flame's Long March, which is a Grade Four cultivation technique."
"Cultivation technique...?" Li Yuanjiao repeated as he delightfully took out a blank jade slip.
Li Xijun, standing beside him, added, "I obtained a secret technique known as Chilling Snow Series."
Li Yuanjiao was very pleased and instructed them to record the details. He took out yet another jade slip and handed it to Li Ximing, saying, "This is the Yang Nourishing Technique I learned from Tu Longjian. I have reviewed it thoroughly and memorized it. Since you'll be working with fire to attract qi, it will benefit you to study this carefully."
He also presented a green jade bottle and explained, "This is Profound Yang Li Fire. You should take it and make use of it."
Li Ximing quickly accepted the items, then read the jade slip carefully, and replied with great enthusiasm, "I've heard that the immortal sect possesses a method to cultivate spirit fire internally… It allows one to draw the spirit fire of heaven and earth into their Shenyang Mansion, where it can be used to refine pills internally or expelled for defense. With Valley Wind Leading Fire, I'll be able to use it to refine pills too!"
"Profound Yang Li Fire is too volatile and intense for pill refinement. I plan to convert it to Long Marching Fire Essence, which is more suitable for refining pills and practicing the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique," he added.
Li Yuanjiao smiled with satisfaction, nodding repeatedly as he said, "That's exactly my intention!"
Li Ximing sighed in regret and continued, "It's a pity that this technique requires Long Marching Fire Essence rather than Spring Sun Spirit Fire. The Yang Nourishing Technique Manual lists over a dozen types of spirit fires. Spring Sun Spirit Fire is like the gentle spring sun, warm and nurturing, making it ideal for alchemy... It would be perfect if we had both types of spirit fire..."
"Hahahaha!"
In good spirits, Li Yuanjiao patted his shoulder and reminded him, "Fortunately, we acquired the Yang Nourishing Technique and the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique manuals through the immortal mirror, which is beyond our destiny. If we could also have the best spirit fire for alchemy, I would suspect this is a trap set up by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators!"
Li Xijun had been standing close by, holding the Chilling Snow Series thoughtfully. Noticing Li Yuanjiao's smile, he said, "I'll descend the mountain to find someone to gather the necessary spiritual qi and cultivate this."
Li Yuanjiao nodded and addressed Li Ximing, "Don't worry about the spirit fire for now. Gathering the required spirit items will take some time… I'll send someone to look for them. You two should focus on stabilizing your cultivation in the meantime. There's no need to rush things! Stay in seclusion on the mountain for a few years and find an excuse for the changes in your cultivation."
Li Ximing and Li Xijun both cupped their fists and replied in unison, "Understood! We will follow your command."
Li Yuanjiao had been cultivating on Mount Qingdu for over a month when Fei Luoya arrived as scheduled.
Fei Luoya called out in front of the green mountain gate. Li Wushao emerged from the lake and, upon seeing Fei Luoya, called out loudly, "I am Li Wushao... What brings you here, Senior?"
"Hooked Serpent…?"
Fei Luoya, who was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, had bloodshot eyes that made him look rather intimidating.
He immediately recognized Li Wushao's true form and replied, "Eastern Sea demon tribe... It is indeed a blessing for you to be part of the Li Family."
Fei Luoya, hailing from Mount Yue, usually spoke in an authoritative and somewhat arrogant manner. He only softened his tone when addressing Li Tongya.
Li Wushao nodded and praised, "Senior, you have sharp eyes."
Li Yuanjiao soon approached and cupped his fist, and greeted the man politely. However, Fei Luoya wasted no time and asked directly, "What news do you have? Can Li Tongya be of assistance? Shall we proceed with eliminating Fu Daimu immediately?"
Li Yuanjiao replied, "I've checked with people in the sect. Fu Daimu had a close friend who joined Azure Pond but died in the devil plague and has no significant backing. However, he does have a certain partnership with the peak master of Fuchen Peak among the thirty-six peaks."
Surprised to hear that the guy actually had connections with people in the Azure Pond Sect, Fei Luoya hurriedly asked, "What should we do then?"
Li Yuanjiao replied softly, "My son has looked into it. Their relationship is strictly transactional and Fuchen Peak doesn't want anything else to do with this person. After you and I deal with him, we can send some precious panacea to this fellow Daoist as a gesture of goodwill and forget about the whole thing."
Fei Luoya was delighted and exclaimed, "Thanks to the connections of your esteemed family, we now have many options!"
Li Yuanjiao smiled, already planning the next moves in his heart.
Fuchen Peak's master, Li Encheng, also known as Water Wall Pearl, is one of the few middle-class alchemists in the Azure Pond Sect and has been at the peak of Foundation Establishment Realm for many years. He will dismiss this small issue as he only views this person as a pawn for selling treasured panaceas.
Who knows, when we have Xizhi send a treasured panacea over, it could open up beneficial connections for him! If this young man has more influence in the sect, it will be advantageous for us too.
Most people from Mount Yue were fierce, and since Fei Luoya was eager to kill Fu Daimu, waiting for another day was no different than torturing him. He wanted to act immediately and urged anxiously, "What are we waiting for then, fellow Daoist? Let us set off immediately!"
Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and explained, "Elders in the family are not permitted to act impulsively. We'll have to wait for another Daoist friend with Sprawling Azure Mountain."
Fei Luoya had no choice but to wait patiently. After more than a day, he saw a red light shooting through the sky. Yuan Chengdun arrived in a red jade boat which he slowly docked in front of the mountain.
He disembarked and stowed the boat away, smiling apologetically as he said, "My apologies for being late, I had to go to Helin Prefecture before coming here."
"No problem!"
Li Yuanjiao looked at the two men. Li Wushao, who had been hovering above the lake, also flew over and stood behind him.
Li Yuanjiao then nodded and said, "I have a powerful formation in hand. Fu Daimu won't be able to escape."
