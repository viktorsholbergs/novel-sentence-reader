Fifty Years Later. Chen Xun had been opening the Earth Acupoints of the Five Elements Immortal Path deep underground. Even his Nascent Soul began to mutate, and acupoints in his body started to open up.
However, when he reached the 15th acupoint, the process was forcibly halted. The Five Elements' energy of heaven and earth surged into his body, breaking open yet another acupoint.
Chen Xun fully regained his sense of control over his realm, and every part of his body felt completely his own again, without any sense of emptiness.
Each acupoint in his body carried a vast amount of the Five Elements' power, deep and profound, with a solid foundation.
"Breaking through the Earth Acupoints without any bottlenecks, even breaking into the 16th acupoint—this corresponds to the mid-Nascent Soul stage." Chen Xun's gaze was deep and dark. "It seems I need to break through at least 26 acupoints to reach the late Nascent Soul stage, as described in the cultivation method."
The operation of Human Acupoints and Earth Acupoints is entirely different. Human Acupoints are like a foundation, forming a small cycle and providing a continuous supply of the Five Elements' energy. In contrast, Earth Acupoints act like a valve, capable of harnessing terrifying amounts of the Five Elements' power, turning the ethereal into the tangible.
Chen Xun had also discovered that opening 40 acupoints marks a major realm, while opening 120 acupoints completes a small cycle, unlocking certain latent abilities within the body.
The synergy between the Spiritual Qi Immortal Path and the Five Elements Immortal Path, converting broken meridians into acupoints without bottlenecks, was remarkable.
"It must be an issue with divine consciousness and the imperfection of the Five Elements Immortal Path that prevents me from breaking free from the framework of the cultivation world." Chen Xun's eyes were filled with understanding. He had yet to find his own path. "Still a long way to go, but that’s what makes it exciting..."
A deep sigh echoed from underground, though if one listened carefully, there was a hint of glee in it.
Chen Xun's body dissolved into earth particles, instantly disappearing underground, with no trace of pressure around.
However, after returning to the surface, Chen Xun did not allow the big black ox to practice this method—it was still incomplete, even somewhat dangerous.
...
Another fifty years passed. At Canghai Sect.
Chen Xun had now perfected the Five Elements Immortal Path technique from the Qi Refining stage to the Nascent Soul stage. The big black ox worshipped him like a god, bowing every day to honor his elder brother.
Now, they were about to leave, having fully absorbed the essence of a hundred schools of thought from the cultivation world, even gathering pill recipes.
The big black ox also snatched a bunch of spirit herb seeds along the way, figuring that leaving two plants behind would keep everyone happy.
In today’s cultivation world, even Nascent Soul cultivators no longer dared to challenge them—their strength had grown so immense that it was hard to believe.
However, just as they were about to leave, something interesting happened.
A young man, on the verge of screaming in shock, saw the familiar man and ox outside the pavilion, their appearance and attire unchanged after all these years.
Moreover, this was one of the Top Ten Sects in the Qian Nation—how could it be?!
"Huh?" Chen Xun looked at the youth under the tree in the distance and smiled faintly, "It's you."
"Moo?" The big black ox also turned to look, its eyes filled with amusement. Wasn't this the disciple from the Chi Ling Sect they had encountered before?
It remembered that the youth had been in the Qi Refining stage back then, yet in just over 300 years, he had reached the early Golden Core stage.
Such terrifying cultivation speed, and from a small sect no less—what kind of spiritual root did he have?
"Sen... Senior..." The young man smiled wryly as he approached. The cultivation world was so vast yet so small.
"Hehe, no need to worry. Who among cultivators doesn’t have some luck and secrets?" Chen Xun sat in his rocking chair, smiling peacefully. "Why aren't you staying at Chi Ling Sect? What brings you so far from home?"
The young man was startled. Why was this senior striking up casual conversation? Something felt off. His mind raced, trying to figure out the meaning behind these words.
"I once received a token, allowing me to join the Canghai Sect directly." A flicker of panic flashed in the youth’s eyes. "So, I came to the Qian Nation, seeking a path to go further."
Chen Xun squinted slightly. It was probably a case of either killing for treasure or finding it by chance. Otherwise, what was he doing at Chi Ling Sect in the first place?
The youth struggled to calm his emotions. He did have a great secret, but it absolutely couldn’t be revealed.
"What’s your name?"
"Meng Sheng."
"You have a good name, young man. Keep cultivating well. Off you go."
Chen Xun stood up, put on his straw hat, and said, "Old Ox, let’s go."
"Moo~" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun. It had been ready for a while.
"Thank you, Senior!"
Meng Sheng bowed deeply, forever remembering Chen Xun and the big black ox, feeling as though he had just escaped death.
He had experienced too many betrayals and schemes on his journey and had grown distrustful of others. Yet this senior gave him a uniquely comforting feeling.
Meng Sheng briefly recalled his childhood in a war-torn small country and the way elders had cared for him.
He shook his head, casting aside the distracting thoughts. He must achieve the great way of immortality! Walk on the supreme path!
...
Two years later. A massive ship floated in the sky, hidden in the clouds and formations, utterly silent with no sound of it cutting through the air.
It seemed to be flying yet also appeared to teleport through the heavens, slowly passing over the Qian Nation and Wu Nation, heading north!
The Northern Region was a wasteland of broken glaciers, crisscrossed by chasms.
Snowflakes fluttered down from the sky, like countless dandelions or tiny, indescribable life forms, trembling, floating, and drifting in the vast night sky.
**Roar!**
**Roar!**
**Roar!**
In the depths of the Northern Region, the angry roars of spirit beasts echoed. Some of the beasts were as large as mountains, roaring toward the heavens with Nascent Soul mid-stage power!
The glaciers creaked violently from beneath the earth as if something was awakening.
Deep within the frozen plains of the North, dark pupils flashed with a fierce light, staring toward the sky.
**Buzz**
**Buzz**
The clouds in the vast night sky began to shatter, revealing the form of an enormous ship. The great tree at the stern of the ship swayed wildly in the snowy winds.
The black and white leaves, even in the night sky, shone with brilliance—clearly no ordinary object.
The entire northern frontier was in turmoil because of this sight.
At that moment, inside the massive ship in the sky, an aura stirred, and light spread everywhere. Two figures stood atop the crane-shaped bow.
One was a man, arms crossed, looking coldly down at the earth, his gaze as indifferent as it could be.
The other was a black ox, standing firmly at the front, staring at the Nascent Soul spirit beasts on the glaciers, its eyes filled with battle intent.
The wind howled, making their robes flap violently, and the straw hats on their backs flew backwards in the gale.
At the same time, two terrifying shadows gradually emerged behind them, their aura so strong it covered the sky with divine brilliance.
Intense rays of light gathered, turning the heavens fiery red. Huge fireballs, like meteors, slowly appeared from dozens of spinning Five Elements discs.
The scorching heat only intensified, evaporating the clouds until they were completely gone, lighting up half the night sky.
**Crack! Crack!**
Heaven and earth trembled, and a powerful spiritual pressure descended!
**Boom!**
A deafening roar echoed.
The spiritual energy in the glaciers seemed to boil over, trembling, scattering, and collapsing!
At that moment, the spirit beasts that had been roaring wildly frozen in terror, sensing a wave of destruction. They all felt the despair of imminent death.
The land fell silent. No more roars.
