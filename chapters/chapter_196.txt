"Has the Li Family gone mad?! How are they brazenly leading troops across the border when the Azure Pond Sect and Mount Yue have marked boundaries..? Even though the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue has been in seclusion for many years, aren't there a bunch of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on Mount Wu? How can they just watch this happen?!"
Yu Mugao massaged his temples, visibly filled with confusion and frustration. He was looking at two subordinates of his that were at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and he asked sternly, "Did you see it clearly?"
"Master, the Li Family has the heir of the previous king of Eastern Mount Yue on their side, claiming that he was there to reclaim the throne... perhaps because of this... Mount Wu did not realize and intervene," explained one of the cultivators who had stepped forward.
Yu Mugao glanced at him and raised his eyebrow skeptically.
"I can see through the Li Family's tactics as well. You don't understand… This is most likely done to offend Mount Wu. It's a risky move, not something Li Tongya would characteristically do! The few from Mount Wu are not known for their tolerance. Although they are not good at direct combat, their shamanic spell is notoriously tricky. In the past, Li Xiangping did not know that Mount Yue had Mount Wu's protection, and had ventured deep into their territory with his men… only to be cursed to death by the people of Mount Wu. Given how it can be considered a rather recent lesson, and also considering Li Tongya's cautious nature, how could he do such a thing..?"
Yu Mugao's words left everyone below him speechless, their heads bowed in deep thought. He stroked his chin thoughtfully. In recent years, Yu Family's Milin Prefecture had faced many troubles. Yu Mugao knew someone was scheming behind the scenes to divert the Yu Family's focus, yet he still had to maintain the situation. He was vexed by the Li Family stirring up more trouble.
"Could it be a problem with Mount Wu..."
Yu Mugao, after eliminating many possibilities in his mind, finally arrived at an unlikely conclusion. He said gravely, "Bring me a paper and a brush, I will write to ask Muxian."
His attendant hurriedly brought the writing materials to him, and Yu Mugao finished writing a brief letter rather quickly. However, his eldest son cautiously stepped forward, whispering in his ear.
"Family Head… Eastern Mount Yue has been under duress to support the Li Family, using the populace to sustain their towns. The Li Family's actions simply replace a loyal ruler of Mount Yue with no significant gain..."
Yu Mugao was stunned, feeling a tightness in his chest before it was filled with rage. He then scolded, "Fool! Before, they were tributaries to the Li Family, but now… Eastern Mount Yue will become a vassal to the Li Family, with all spirit fields and spirit items under their control! The difference is not slight, how can such words come from your mouth?!"
The young man paled and withdrew. Yu Mugao slammed the table angrily and shouted, "You will learn nothing by being here… get out, and send your younger brother in tomorrow!"
Watching his eldest son retreat dejectedly, Yu Mugao's frustration simmered. He narrowed his eyes as he muttered coldly, "We can't let the Li Family run wild either… We simply can't allow Li Tongya to grow too powerful! We must think of a way to suppress them."
Mulu Town, as the capital of Eastern Mount Yue, boasted a population of twenty thousand, comparable to one of the four towns under the Li Family. When Mu Jiaoman was reigning, he had been diligent. He constructed four roads leading to the four borders, greatly facilitating the movement of the Li Family's troops. It only took them one night to reach Mulu Town.
The town gates were wide open, and a group of Mount Yue's clansmen kneeled before them—including two Qi Cultivators, who were also bowed. The dark chariot ignored them and drove straight into the town, heading straight for the palace.
The chariot, carrying a host of soldiers, stopped in front of the blood-stained palace where more Mount Yue ministers were kneeling. Li Yuanxiu got off the chariot with Chen Donghe following behind him silently. His gaze swept over the crowd, finally resting on the woman at the front.
Li Yuanxiu took two steps forward and helped Li Feiruo to her feet with a smile on his face.
"Auntie has preserved the palace's formations for our family, and they were even strong enough to withstand ordinary Qi Cultivators… You're a great hero in this battle!"
Li Feiruo smiled faintly before she stood up gracefully to face him. She then said softly, "The clans heard that our family elder was coming and were so terrified that they wanted to surrender. I haven't done much… I just facilitated the connections!"
After modestly downplaying her role and efforts, Li Feiruo clapped her hands. Like clockwork, several Mount Yue tribesmen brought forward two bodies, dropping them with a thud in front of the steps.
Li Feiruo spoke again, but this time her voice carried some coldness.
"These two were Qimu's shaman and his loyal dog Zhong Yudai, both of whom have been executed."
Li Yuanxiu nodded in response, and two people behind him stepped forward to confirm their identities. Li Feiruo then had someone bring out Qimu's three children, and declared loudly, "Qimu had his brothers slaughtered… Now, only Shamoli and these three heirs of Mu Jiaoman remain. I thought the main family might find a use for them, so I detained them for the time being. The decision is yours to make, Young Family Head."
"What use could they be? Just kill them." Li Yuanxiu smiled faintly before walking past the crowd with Li Feiruo. Both entered the inner hall together, ignoring the children's desperate cries and pleas for mercy behind them.
In the spotlessly clean inner hall, the clan soldiers quickly took their positions on both sides, giving the empty hall a somber appearance.
"What is this?" Li Yuanxiu asked as he looked up at the throne. There, a brown spherical object was hanging, swaying, and overlooking everyone below.
"The Eye of Jianixi."
Li Feiruo answered flatly, causing Li Yuanxiu to pause briefly before she continued, "Mu Jiaoman obtained the remains of Jianixi and preserved his Foundation Establishment Realm eyeball, preventing it from decaying. They hang above the throne, overseeing everyone..."
"The customs of Mount Yue are indeed eerie…" Li Yuanxiu muttered as he glanced at the brown eyeball, feeling an inexplicable familiarity with it. Deciding not to dwell on it, he then gave a soft command.
"Take it down to be used in a ritual for Granduncle Xiangping."
"Yes!"
As soon as that command was given, two clan soldiers immediately stepped forward to remove the eyeball. Li Yuanxiu took another look at it before turning to Li Feiruo.
"Auntie never had children of her own..?"
"I once did have my own… but they were harmed by Mu Jiaoman."
As she said this, Li Feiruo touched her stomach gently, her expression slightly weary. Li Yuanxiu was clearly taken aback by this revelation and felt a sense of guilt.
"You've endured a lot over the years, Auntie… is there anything you wish for?" he asked softly, his tone apologetic.
Li Feiruo's lips curved into a smile, and she slowly kneeled down.
"There is indeed one thing… I am only in my thirties, and I wish to choose a cultivator from our family to marry into mine; to have a son or a daughter. This would comfort me in my remaining years."
Li Feiruo's answer was unexpected yet reasonable to Li Yuanxiu, who nodded in agreement. Just then, the palace doors swung open. This was startling to all those present, as there were no strong winds at all.
The clan soldiers on either side bowed as a middle-aged man with a sword on his back stepped into the hall, revealing himself. He had another sword at his waist, and he exuded an extremely commanding aura.
"Greetings, Granduncle!"
Li Yuanxiu's demeanor immediately became solemn and submissive, bowing down.
Li Feiruo followed suit though she did not recognize the man, as she could tell from everyone's reactions that he ought to be of importance.
"Feiruo greets the elder!"
"No need for such formalities."
Li Tongya nodded approvingly as he glanced at Li Feiruo, saying warmly, "Well done, you have saved our family much trouble… Which branch are you from?"
"My father is Li Yesheng, who served Lord Xiangping. Li Xiewen is my elder brother," Li Feiruo answered respectfully.
Li Tongya clapped his hands, letting out a hearty laugh.
"So you are Yesheng's daughter? Then there's no mistake about it! You have your father's spirit! Back then, I had Xuan'er send a clan daughter over, never imagining it was you."
Li Feiruo smiled and thanked him. Li Tongya then made a quick gesture, and the eyeball, previously held by a servant, flew up and landed before him.
The brown eyeball, once filled with fierceness and slyness, now only held a vacant stillness. Li Tongya inspected it closely and sighed.
"Jianixi... a man that once drove our family into disarray. I have to admit, he was truly a remarkable person! Fortunately, he died at the hands of Mount Yue's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator..."
Li Yuanxiu, young and not very familiar with that history, listened intently. Li Feiruo, having spent many years in Mount Yue, was more knowledgeable and hence explained it to him softly.
"I heard that Jianixi was a half-brother of Mu Jiaoman—born of a slave, who acquired an ancient secret technique to cultivate his qi. He reached the Foundation Establishment Realm by the mere age of forty. He was truly a genius."
Li Tongya frowned when he heard this.
What ancient secret technique..? Even if one acquires such a method, it's impossible to cultivate without proper qi. That was most likely an opportunity arranged by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue...
He then raised an eyebrow and asked, "Do you know what kind of immortal foundation Jianixi established?"
"Mu Jiaoman, when drunk and weeping for Jianixi, once mentioned that his foundation was profoundly powerful and mysterious."
After saying this, Li Feiruo thought for a moment and paused. When she spoke again, her voice was low and serious.
"It is called Emperor's Mandate."
