The Special Affairs Officer Begins Negotiations
* * *
Saaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Taiche was gazing out the window of the conference room in the tentatively named Zamago Forest Adventurer’s Guild branch office, watching the autumn wind coolly swaying the leaves of the crops inside the base.
Those crops were something Taiche had never seen before, at least until now.
Vines as tall as an adult were climbing wooden poles stuck in the field.
Mixed with purple flowers, small pod-like things could be seen, so it was probably some kind of bean.
And looking further back, fields with vines different from those beans and plants with thick, round leaves growing close to the ground were flourishing, extending towards the defensive wall.
“Wow, this is an ordinarily nice and peaceful place!”
Yuju, who was standing behind Taiche with her sword still at her waist as her bodyguard, said something ordinarily carefree.
“Well, that might be true……”
Even while saying that, Taiche hunched her back and rubbed her elbows.
…… She was feeling a bit of stress.
For Taiche, this base space was somehow uncomfortable.
As mentioned earlier, she has an abnormally good memory.
Now, she can recite the names of most animals and plants from memory and has memorized their value as materials and effects.
However, her memory isn’t very useful inside this base.
This place is filled with crops of unknown nature.
Since she’s not used to such a situation, Taiche inevitably feels uneasy.
By the way, the fact that Taiche doesn’t remember them means the crops being cultivated outside are probably new species of plants discovered in this demon realm forest.
After all, the Zamago Forest is a demon realm that hardly anyone has entered…… It wouldn’t be surprising if it had its own unique ecosystem.
But even so, to select edible plants from those new species and start cultivating them on a decent scale.
Moreover, within a few months.
No matter how you think about it, that seems strange.
It would certainly be possible if there were people immune to poison who could sample the forest’s grass and select the delicious ones, and an agricultural genius who could quickly come up with cultivation methods.
You want to retort, “There’s no way such guys exist!”
…… But this base does have such abnormal personnel.
Taiche already knew that from Earthcell’s report.
“…………”
By the way, I wonder what the water inside the cup served when I was shown to this conference room is……
If you look closely, there seem to be cut-up pieces of vines floating in it, and it’s sour.
It tastes similar to memon water but has less aroma and a stronger sourness.
However, it’s not an unpleasant sourness.
It’s unknown and concerning, so it feels unpleasant when you start thinking about it, but it’s delicious.
You end up drinking it enthusiastically without thinking.
D-Damn it!
“Wow, it’s ordinarily nice weather!”
Next to Taiche, who was agonizing over the strange conflict, Yuju said something ordinary while looking out the window.
And that’s when it happened.
“Foooh~~~! Sorry to keep you waiting, Taiche! Long time no see~~~!”
Opening the door to the conference room while making a lively commotion, New Branch Establishment Official Earthcell entered with a big smile.
For now, Taiche regained her composure and looked above Earthcell’s head.
And after confirming that he wasn’t wearing panties on his head and feeling relieved, she stood up and bowed.
“It’s been a while, Earthcell. First of all, let me offer my heartfelt praise. It’s amazing that you managed to create such a facility in just a few months. I am genuinely impressed.”
“Fwahahaha! That’s right! You should respect your grandpa even moreee!”
“Hahaha, I already respect you, you know? Just in terms of your work.”
With a smile, the special affairs officer and the new branch establishment official shook hands across the table.
“So, well…… Before we talk about work in detail, I’d like to introduce……”
Saying that, Earthcell sent his gaze behind him.
Standing there were a somewhat good-looking blond man and a man with a villain’s face who had entered the room following Earthcell.
Receiving Earthcell’s gaze, the blond man put on a somewhat amiable smile, took a step forward, placed his hand on his chest, and bowed.
“Nice to meet you, Special Affairs Officer! My name is……”
“Ah, I know. You’re Patchino-san, right?”
However, Taiche stopped the self-introduction of the blond man, who had put on a perfectly sociable smile, by preemptively calling his name.
“Adventurer Rank 7. A magic swordsman. The leader of the party, and the members are Niese, Modokin, and Darmacy. The party name is ‘Tea Dragon’s Heel’, and the origin of the name was ‘to avoid overlapping with other parties’. Originally, you wanted names like ‘Red Dragon’s Fang’ or ‘Blue Dragon’s Wing’, but disliking those cool but rather common names, you ended up going for something quirky. And your request completion rate as an adventurer is 90%. If we only look at this, we could say you’re a considerably excellent adventurer. Except for the fact that you engaged in ‘hero fraud’.”
Patchino’s personal information was revealed in detail.
Patchino involuntarily stiffened with a strained smile.
Seeing that, Taiche grinned.
“…… Patchino, I told you before. Taiche is a ‘walking adventurer encyclopedia’! She can probably recite not only your request completion rate but even the contents if she feels like it hoho!”
“Huh, scary. It’s so amazing that it’s scary instead.”
Earthcell patted the shoulder of Patchino, who had frozen.
“Hey, Taiche-san. Isn’t that ordinarily rude?”
Yuju, the bodyguard, ordinarily reprimanded Taiche, who had interrupted the self-introduction and started talking.
“Eh…… Ahem.”
Taiche stopped grinning, cleared her throat, and took control of the situation again.
In fact, she was well aware that it was a rude behavior.
On top of that, she deliberately did this to naturally deliver the next line.
“And…… ‘John’-san. I heard from Earthcell’s report that you provided a great deal of assistance in the construction of this planned branch office location. On behalf of the Adventurer’s Guild, I express my gratitude.”
Saying that, Taiche bowed her head towards the man with the villain’s face…… Giovanno.
“Hmm……”
Giovanno stared at Taiche.
Taiche, who had raised her head, smiled tightly without a word.
“Gratitude is unnecessary. My comrades and I were building a base in this land. Then, Earthcell-dono came and helped us with the base construction. Regarding the branch office construction, I merely lent the land. The one who should be grateful is me.”
Giovanno also twisted his villain’s face to the fullest and made a smile.
It’s probably an evil smile that would make children cry if they saw it, but it can’t be helped since he originally has that kind of face.
Now, the flow of the conversation just now.
Earthcell and Patchino didn’t understand the meaning and inadvertently tilted their heads and looked at each other’s faces.
“Foh? What are you saying, Taiche? This person’s name isn’t ‘John’, it’s Gio……”
“Ah! There are panties flying outside the window!”
“Eh! Really!? Whereee!?”
And here, when Earthcell was about to say something unnecessary, Taiche pointed outside the window and lied to cover it up.
Earthcell instantly flew to the window and desperately searched for the panties.
His back showed the most enthusiasm of the day!
“Oh my……”
Yuju was ordinarily put off by that bizarre behavior.
…… Let’s organize the information a bit here.
Taiche is already convinced that the true identity of the man with the villain’s face in front of her is Giovanno Ack Toh, the former nobleman exiled from the Pokkeroce Kingdom.
But Earthcell is not.
Originally working at a branch in a different country, he wasn’t aware of the information about those involved in the incident that occurred in the Pokkeroce Kingdom.
The situation is the same for the “Tea Dragon’s Heel” group, as they were outlaw drifters.
Giovanno himself had repeatedly hinted that he was a great sinner, but he hadn’t stated any definite facts.
He was afraid of being despised by his comrades.
And his comrades also had their own wounds.
There was no one who would dare expose a comrade’s past.
Therefore, in this place now, there was a strange situation where the only person who knew about Giovanno’s past was Taiche, who had come from outside.
And from the fact that Taiche, who should have received a report from Earthcell, called him “John”, Giovanno understood that the special affairs officer in front of him was aware of his true identity and that there was still room for negotiation, treating him as the pioneer John rather than the great sinner Giovanno.
“Now then, New Branch Establishment Official Earthcell. Let’s talk about the branch office recognition of this place right away.”
“Foh!? O-Oh! That’s right, that’s right! Taiche, don’t you think this place has already met the conditions to start full-scale operation?”
Earthcell, who had been leaning out the window searching for panties, regained his sanity at Taiche’s words and hurriedly sat down on a chair.
Seeing that, the other people except Yuju also took their seats with wry smiles.
“We’ll reconfirm the details from now on, but…… to give you the conclusion, you pass.”
“Foooh~~~!!!”
“In the first place, the surrounding environment is rich in materials, the living environment such as defensive walls, water, and houses is well-equipped, access is easy thanks to the road, and if you can even be self-sufficient in food, the Adventurer’s Guild can already dispatch clerical staff at this point. Furthermore, if interaction with merchants has already begun, I’d like to quickly proceed with the work to officially operate this place as an Adventurer’s Guild branch office.”
“Ooh…… I’m so happyyy! For efforts to bear fruit like this and become results!”
“Haha! Isn’t that great, perverted old geezer!”
Patchino gently patted the back of Earthcell, who started blowing his nose and wiping his eyes with a handkerchief.
“Good for you, Earthcell-dono.”
Giovanno also clapped his hands.
However…… contrary to the congratulatory words, his eyes were not smiling.
“But you know, ‘we’ did verbally lend the land to Earthcell-dono. However, I don’t recall agreeing to the establishment of an Adventurer’s Guild branch office, you know?”
And he started saying such things.
“”Huh?””
Earthcell and Patchino froze, not understanding the intention of the statement.
But Special Affairs Officer Taiche was used to it.
She made a smile.
“Oh my, is that so? It seems there was a discrepancy in understanding between John-san and us.”
“It’s a good opportunity. I’d like to discuss various things in detail here, if possible.”
“Yes, that’s fine. I am confident that we can have a mutually satisfactory discussion.”
“Hmm. That’s a pleasant thing to hear. Is it possible to make a written agreement here?”
“Of course. Many authorities are delegated to special affairs officers, so.”
Leaving aside the perverted old geezer and the somewhat blond guy with question marks above their heads, the negotiation between Giovanno and Taiche began.
Man, this old man is really troublesome once he starts getting motivated!
