Li Xijun listened intently. Back when Mount Wu was divided, four factions remained on the southern bank. Jiao Zhongzi was the strongest, occupying Mount Wu and establishing North Mount Yue. Fu Daimu took over Great Jueting but was later eradicated by Fei Luoya in alliance with the Li Family, and Great Jueting ultimately fell under Li Family control.
Looking at it now… the Foundation Establishment cultivators of Mount Yue, whom our elders once feared, have dwindled. Only Huo Luo'e, a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, remains. Taking control of all Mount Yue territories… doesn’t seem difficult anymore!
As he contemplated the population and spiritual resources of Mount Yue, his true desire lay in Mount Wu. Even if the cultivators at the Purple Mansion Realm had already scoured it clean, it had once been the palace of Duanmu Kui, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator who had dominated an era! If he could set foot there, he might unravel many mysteries.
While Li Xijun was lost in thought, Fei Luoya could no longer hold back and asked, "Your esteemed family should give me an answer!"
As soon as he spoke, he saw Li Xijun suddenly look past him, bow respectfully, and softly say, "Xijun greets the ancestor!"
Fei Luoya’s heart skipped a beat. His first thought was that Li Tongya was still alive! But when he extended his spiritual sense, he saw that a figure was approaching the hall at a steady pace.
The figure approaching had a cold face and white beard, his brows sharp as blades, broad shoulders, and a sturdy build. His dazzling Black Gold Spirit Armor shimmered brilliantly. Fei Luoya’s Immortal Foundation Untraceable Presence was highly attuned to reading the colors in others' eyes. But when he looked into this veteran’s gaze, it was like being pierced by twin swords. It seemed as if this old man had just slain a monstrous beast from the sea or killed an heir of an immortal sect, still carrying the lingering scent of blood.
Li Xuanfeng merely glanced at him coldly. Fei Luoya immediately turned around and cupped his hands in greeting, "So it is the Golden Bowstring Li Xuanfeng. I am Fei Luoya Greetings, General."
Li Xuanfeng’s reputation was at its peak. The direct disciples of Golden Feather Sect and Azure Pond Sect were all in seclusion,making progress in their cultivation. Meanwhile, he had made his name known with a single arrow strike against the Song Family, earning a reputation as the strongest cultivator below the Purple Mansion Realm.. Only a few others like Tang Shedu, Shen Xi, and Yuan Chengdun could compare to him. Although Fei Luoya was of an older generation, he did not dare act superior and instead addressed him as a peer.
Fei Luoya observed the veteran general, but Li Xuanfeng was also studying him, silently calculating, I’ve heard that his Immortal Foundation ability is Untraceable Presence. If he is more than a hundred miles away, he should be able to evade my first arrow and escape. But if not, I can take his head within twenty arrows.
Li Xuanfeng’s combat style was entirely different from that of ordinary cultivators. He never dragged battles out to a hundred exchanges. His bowstring technique was about piercing defenses and delivering swift, decisive kills, even at the cost of self-inflicted injury. If a fight lasted too long, he would be the one who couldn’t hold out.
Fei Luoya suddenly felt a chill on his neck, silently swallowed his saliva, and thought, This is the level of a true direct descendant of an immortal sect. Even if Jiao Zhongzi were here… he'd have no choice but to flee. I’ve heard he serves under Daoist Master Yuan Su. No wonder…
Li Xuanfeng took a few steps forward, stopping in front of him before asking, "I heard you seek refuge and wish to leave this place."
"That’s correct." Fei Luoya was overjoyed and bowed deeply, saying, "I hope the general will introduce me… I am willing to follow you and defend the southern border."
"Rise first." Li Xuanfeng simply said, "This matter can wait. First, tell me, where has Jiao Zhongzi gone?"
Fei Luoya was slightly startled but replied, "He should have fled to the Eastern Sea. I’ve checked multiple times, there’s no trace of him in North Mount Yue. There’s only a single early cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm left to guard the place…"
Li Xuanfeng knew that Jiao Zhongzi had already been at the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm many years ago and asked with doubt, "Did he break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?"
Fei Luoya shook his head and said in a low voice, "Duanmu Kui never left behind any methods at the Purple Mansion Realm, only methods at the Foundation Establishment Realm. Otherwise, Jiao Zhongzi wouldn’t have been so restless here. If he wants to seek a path forward, his only option is to head to the Eastern Sea."
Li Xuanfeng nodded in acknowledgment and finally said, "Recite your cultivation technique."
Li Xijun quickly took out a blank jade slip. Fei Luoya hesitated slightly but then nodded heavily. He took the jade slip, closed his eyes and concentrated deeply as he carefully engraved the technique.
A Foundation Establishment cultivator’s spiritual sense was swift. Within moments, Li Xijun received the jade slip from him, swept it with his spiritual sense and saw the title inscribed, The Concealment and Obfuscation Sutra.
This technique was of the third rank, containing over a hundred thousand words. The phrasing carried an ancient tone, showing that Mount Wu’s inheritance was indeed extraordinary. Surprisingly, it even included a complementary blade technique called Reflections on the Blood Court.
This blade technique seemed more like a collection of insights, it was highly profound. It was suited for those who practiced The Concealment and Obfuscation Sutra and had already attained significant mastery in blade arts. Since it was of no direct use to him, he silently put it away.
In order to assist the family, Li Xuanfeng had initially considered taking down a few Mount Yue cultivators while Daoist Master Yuan Su was still alive. But with the real concern Jiao Zhongzi now having fled, he said softly, "Since you have this intent, follow behind me for now and let's head to the southern border."
Fei Luoya nodded hastily. Li Xuanfeng allowed him to return to his cave dwelling to gather his belongings. Once seated again, Li Xijun said, "Fei Luoya has lived among our family for many years and has some sense about him. If he follows the second great uncle… he won’t be a burden."
Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly and said in a quiet voice, "Qinghong is cultivating at sea, call Kongheng back. My task is nearly complete, and making a move myself is becoming troublesome. These minor Mount Yue cultivators… I leave them to you all."
"Yes!" replied Li Xijun.
Seeing Li Xijun respond, Li Xuanfeng said, "There will be changes ahead. It will no longer be suitable for me to remain in direct contact with the family, as I cannot oversee everything at once. I will watch from the shadows, I will act if there is anything I can assist with."
Li Xijun once again recalled the wound on his face and softly said, "Second great uncle, take care."
Li Xuanfeng dismissed the concern and paid it no mind. As Li Xijun cupped his hands in farewell, intending to summon Li Xuanxuan, Li Xuanfeng raised a hand to stop him and said, "Calling him is pointless, it would only disturb his state of mind. Just remind my elder brother to take care of himself."
His actions were decisive and unhesitating. Without delay, he boarded his jade boat and departed. Li Xijun returned to the hall, glanced at Li Chengliao, and asked, "How is Wei’er? Has he emerged from seclusion?"
Li Chengliao replied, "He has already exited seclusion and reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."
Li Xijun nodded slightly, picked up his brush, dipped it in ink, and softly said, "Have the family prepare for the matters regarding Mount Yue. Once Kongheng returns, we will act. A month's time should be just right, and it's best to root them out completely."
