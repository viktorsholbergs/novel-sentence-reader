The hall where Ning Heyuan resided was nearby, so he soon arrived, greeting both of them with a smile. Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly and asked, "Any recent movements from Yuanwu Peak?"
Ning Heyuan was momentarily surprised, then nodded in realization and replied, "Brother-in-law, Yuanwu Peak cultivates with metal and iron properties, so with the Green Pine Temple matter… I hear Daoist Master Yuanwu is very interested."
So it all comes back to Green Pine Temple! Li Qinghong's suspicions were confirmed.
Li Xuanfeng took a moment to recall and then spoke gravely, "As I remember… Green Pine Temple was known for its arts of Swamp Metal and Fire Virtue… Most of what is left there should be cultivation techniques, correct?"
"Exactly," Ning Heyuan replied softly. "The temple holds various ancient arts, though those relating to Swamp Metal and Fire Virtue are more recent and abundant. Most of them are practicable, making them especially coveted. And these ruins are about to be opened to a select few, with all the sects making preparations."
Li Xuanfeng had heard vague mentions of this before, though he hadn't delved into it and knew little of the specifics. In a low voice, he said, "Explain the background of this matter in detail."
"Certainly," Ning Heyuan nodded and began to recount, "The story begins with Chu Yi of the Li Fire Spear."
Then he began to narrate the story, "The True Monarch of the Luoxia grotto heaven possessed vast divine abilities and profound insight into the mysteries of heaven and earth. With his Fruition Attainment, he incarnated as a mortal and journeyed northward. Although we lesser cultivators do not fully understand his purpose, we witnessed strange phenomena arising from the void, triggering the fates of countless individuals."
He spoke in a somewhat mysterious manner but, feeling he hadn't conveyed it clearly, continued more directly, "In essence, the True Monarch's reincarnated form descended into the world, and various figures aligned with his fate emerged in succession. These individuals, possessing threads of fate, rose from all corners, chosen by heaven as its favored ones."
So that's how Xu Xiao came to be… Li Qinghong had a sudden realization. Figures like Xu Xiao and Tu Longjian were originally supporting characters in the True Monarch's grand narrative. With this new understanding, she listened as Ning Heyuan continued, "But the True Monarch's reincarnated form returned to Mount Luoxia rather abruptly, leaving this group of Fated Ones still wandering across the north and south, stirring up countless disturbances."
Li Xuanfeng frowned slightly and asked, "Could the Daoist Masters identify them?"
Knowing the nature of the three sects and seven gates, Li Xuanfeng understood they would see such individuals as invaluable resources, or at the very least, useful tools. He doubted they would let them slip by.
Ning Heyuan offered a wry smile and replied quietly, "Even the Daoist Masters could not recognize them outright. All they know is that a group of such individuals exists, scattered among the common folk."
"Although the Daoist Masters could not identify them directly, those who stood out from the crowd were almost certainly people bearing a thread of fate. The sect has focused on a few of these individuals, recording them all in the sect's registry," Ning Heyuan explained.
He paused briefly and added with a slight smile, "That Xu Xiao from your clan likely belongs to this group; he happened to form a connection with Crimson Reef Island…"
Seeing that Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong weren't particularly interested in discussing Xu Xiao, Ning Heyuan tactfully skimmed over the topic, continuing in a quiet tone, "Green Pine Temple is located on the island, and entry to it depends entirely on fate. How could the Daoist Masters tolerate such uncertainty?"
"So, Daoist Master Tianyuan of the Golden Feather Sect proposed gathering this group of fated individuals and sending them all to Green Pine Island. With their intertwined fates, after a few days or weeks, one of them is bound to unlock the grotto heaven." Ning Heyuan continued, "The Green Pine Temple's grotto heaven cannot accommodate Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so each of them is simply waiting for the right moment to enter in single file."
Only now did Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong fully grasp the situation, as the many pieces of recent events started to come together. Li Qinghong frowned and asked, "But… why not bring these fated individuals into the sects… dispatching them as sect disciples would give them loyalty, and afterward, they could officially be inducted."
Ning Heyuan looked slightly embarrassed and lowered his voice, "These people… they are meant to be divided among the Daoist Masters afterward. Making them official disciples would look bad, and if they were part of the sect, we would have to provide them with dharma artifacts. By sending them out to roam as rogue cultivators, they will discover countless grotto heavens and treasure troves on their own, and their artifacts will still be high quality… Ultimately, the sect gains it all for free."
"So that is the reason… truly… a clever scheme," Li Qinghong murmured. She thought of these so-called Fated Ones, who, despite their current glory, were unknowingly being guided toward a deadly confrontation at Green Pine Temple, where they would all end up as keys for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to unlock the ruins. She could only shake her head silently.
Ning Heyuan sighed and said quietly, "This is not the first time… it is the reward the Luoxia Immortal Sect promised Jiangnan."
Now that the details were fully laid out, the sequence of events became clear. Li Xuanfeng paused, then said gravely, "It seems that fate has its limits… it cannot contend against the divine abilities of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators… Since you mentioned that this is not the first time, has no one ever managed to escape?"
"There are always exceptions," Ning Heyuan replied with a slight smile. "Two hundred years ago, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan wanted to open the Douxuan Grotto Heaven at the Qunyi Strait. One fated individual managed to charm a fairy from an immortal sect, and after discovering the truth, they joined forces with another person of destiny. Together, they ventured deep into the grotto heaven, using their courage and fate to make a daring escape."
Ning Heyuan continued, "That individual was named Guo Shentong. He is now the Island Master of Crimson Reef Island, and his Dao companion is Fairy Tianwan of the Golden Feather Sect. As for the other who joined him, their name is lost to time, but they were known as Daoist Changxiao."
He looked intently at the two of them and added quietly, "Guo Shentong hid overseas, quietly cultivated to the Purple Mansion Realm, and later returned openly to Jiangnan to establish his own sect, which is now known as Changxiao Gate."
The revelation was significant, and both Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong were taken aback, even Li Xuanfeng raising an eyebrow in mild disbelief. Li Qinghong, surprised, asked, "So these two sects… did they intervene in the Green Pine Temple matter?"
"They are very much involved," Ning Heyuan gave a sarcastic smile and replied in a low voice, "With interests at the forefront, who would let this opportunity slip by? Should they release every Destined One, allowing them to establish their own sects and achieve the Purple Mansion Realm, ultimately squeezing their own territory? The two Daoist Masters would never permit that."
Ning Heyuan chuckled and said, "From what my uncles have told me, these two—of all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators—are the most wary of Fated Ones! I will not speak much of Daoist Master Changxiao, since he resides overseas and I do not know him well. But Daoist Master Guo alone has personally taken down two of them, both of whom he destroyed completely with his Purple Mansion Realm power, erasing those two arrogant young cultivators in the Embryonic Breathing Realm, body and soul."
He spoke as if he were sharing an amusing anecdote, though his tone held an undertone of schadenfreude and even a hint of envy he himself didn't seem to notice. He continued with a smile, "I saw it myself that year. That young cultivator, riding on his thread of fate, had overcome every obstacle and was just about to escape overseas. But Daoist Master Guo shattered the great void, descended right there, and wielded a Grade Six spell combined with his divine ability, leaving the youth not even a sliver of a chance. He annihilated the young cultivator's entire clan."
Ning Heyuan shrugged. "He forged his own divine abilities through fate and understands its power better than anyone. How could he be careless? He will never let one slip away…"
