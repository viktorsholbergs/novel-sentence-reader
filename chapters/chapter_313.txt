Li Yuanping performed a hand seal before passing through the golden barrier of the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation and ascending Mount Lijing alone.
Since Li Tongya had gone into seclusion for cultivation and Li Yuanjiao had gone to Mount Wutu, Li Yuanping took over the responsibilities of the Li Family. He often stayed at the foot of the mountain for several months, leaving Mount Lijing largely deserted. The weeds between the stones had grown wildly, giving the place an overgrown look.
Li Yuanping climbed the mountain and pushed open the wooden gate of the side courtyard, where he saw a round-faced girl spreading out books and wooden slips to dry in the courtyard. Her attire was simple and her sleeves were tightly sewn, making her look more like a busy servant rather than a daughter of a prestigious clan.
"Qingxiao!"
A faint smile appeared on Li Yuanping's pale face as he called out to the girl.
The girl looked up in surprise and exclaimed with joy, "Brother?! What brings you up here on the mountain?"
The children of the Li Family had grown up together on the mountain and were close. Li Yuanping laughed heartily and replied, "I have come to see you."
Li Qingxiao smiled sweetly and teased, "I heard you recently married a lovely wife. I thought it was her pillow talk that brought you here!"
Li Yuanping's face turned red with embarrassment, and he quickly changed the subject, saying awkwardly, "How can you stand staying on the mountain? It is eerily quiet here."
Li Qingxiao's lips curled up as she shook her head and replied, "It is not too bad. Big Sister[1] often comes up to visit me. Besides, I have a lot of books to keep me busy!"
Li Qingxiao's resembled Chen Donghe more than her mother. Her features were not remarkable, and if not for the gentle temperament that showed in her eyes, she would have looked quite plain. She grinned, further disrupting the harmony of her facial features, causing her to look less elegant.
"Though I stay on the mountain, I have heard many rumors about the Dou Family being overbearing and possessing private spirit fields," she said bluntly.
Li Yuanping nodded, his eyes widening with interest as he was sensitive to these matters. Although these words came from Li Qingxiao, they immediately made him think of the Chen Family and other branches. Smiling, he asked, "What's your opinion about that?"
Li Qingxiao blinked and answered without hesitation, "I suspect the Dou Family has offended our family's branches!"
"How so?" Li Yuanping asked, intrigued.
Li Qingxiao answered, "I have met Madam Dou. She's a shrewd and capable woman. There's no way she couldn't control her clan. The so-called overbearing behavior of the Dou Family likely touches on the interests of many. Old Master Dou is shortsighted and not worth worrying about.
"As for private spirit fields… This matter is neither big nor small. Which of the prominent families does not secretly open some spirit fields? It is an unspoken rule, but bringing it up suggests a larger issue involving more than just the Dou Family. If pursued, many prominent families would be implicated."
Li Qingxiao blinked and smiled, continuing, "Such direct targeting of the Dou Family without fear of offending other prominent families must come from our own elders and uncles! They must be testing you since you have just taken charge."
The Li Family had specific standards for dividing spirit fields, and the ones with thin spiritual qi were dismissed by the Li Family but eagerly sought after by prominent families.
Li Qingxiao did not need to investigate to know that these people likely had private spirit fields. Li Yuanping laughed heartily and nodded repeatedly, remarking, "You are right, but you missed the Chen Family."
Seeing Li Qingxiao frown in confusion, Li Yuanping explained, "You live alone on the mountain… For you to hear these rumors, they must have come from your father who heard it from the Chen Family. These negative rumors have shown the Chen Family's stance."
Li Qingxiao suddenly understood, clapping her hands in realization. Li Yuanping then continued seriously, "In the past five years, our family has taken over Mount Yuting and Mount Huazhong. The spiritual energy in Huazhong is especially abundant, even richer than in several towns in Lijing. The bustling world thrives on profit, and the chaos is driven by it. Do not think the prominent families and branches are fighting without reason; it is all for the benefit of these two places."
Seeing Li Qingxiao nod thoughtfully, Li Yuanping continued, "For decades, the branches have been suppressed by us, unable to become landlords or wealthy merchants, even enjoying themselves in secret. How can they be content? Naturally, they seek opportunities to speculate in these two places."
"I have just started managing the family and I have not used any harsh methods, so naturally, these people are getting restless. The Dou Family seems arrogant and overbearing, but they are actually good dogs. They do not get along with the other branches, making them handy to use," Li Yuanping explained as he picked up a wooden slip from the desk and gently flipped it over before continuing, "When our Jade Court Guards all break through to the Jade Capital Stage and gain spiritual senses, they will easily be able to monitor the activities in Huazhong and Yuting. Once I have control over the entire clan, these branches will have no room to maneuver, and the time will be right."
Li Qingxiao nodded silently and said, "The families on the lake have always been wary of outsiders and relied heavily on the branches. Yet, Brother, you do the opposite and seem to be most cautious of the branches."
Li Yuanping smiled and replied, "There are loyal cultivators among the branches who naturally need to be promoted. However, most are parasites and wastrels. But at the end of the day, they are still related to us. If I do not handle this well, the next generation will have an even harder time dealing with them due to their lack of seniority. The Lu and Yu Families serve as clear warnings; we must be cautious."
They exchanged a knowing smile with each other. Li Yuanping then remembered his true purpose for the visit and asked abruptly, "By the way, what do you think of Xiao Xian from Mount Yu?"
They had been discussing important family matters, and the sudden change of topic caught Li Qingxiao off guard.
"Ah!" She exclaimed in surprise before lowering her head.
Li Yuanping looked at her carefully and teased, "I guess words aren't needed when it comes to matters between a man and a woman."
Li Qingxiao quickly raised her head, her cheeks slightly red, and retorted, "Brother, what are you saying? This man is frivolous, running to our place every day. Everyone knows how much he admires me, and it is quite embarrassing!"
"Hahaha!" Li Yuanping laughed heartily in amusement and commented, "He is sincere. Given his status in the Mount Yu branch, he has already humbled himself greatly."
"True…" Li Qingxiao smiled as she calmed herself down, and then said seriously, "He appears deeply affectionate, but I am not a naive girl who does not know anything. A few acts of kindness do not make a good man. We have only shared a few encounters; I know his face, but not his heart. We still need to consult the elders."
Li Yuanping nodded lightly and replied, "He has a gentle nature, comes from a prestigious family, and has both good looks and intelligence. He is honest and sincere; it is hard to find someone better. I have already sent for Uncle Donghe and our big brother."
"Good," Li Qingxiao responded softly, tying up her long hair as she softly said, "I have also looked into the children from other families within the clan. None of them seem capable, and their characters are worse. If we can find someone from a prestigious clan outside, it would definitely be better than a prominent family within."
Li Yuanping, his face pale, nodded and smiled, saying, "Brother Yuanyun's children are also on the mountain. How do you find living with them?"
Hearing this, Li Qingxiao hesitated, organizing her thoughts but found herself unable to express them. She shook her head in response, looking regretful and melancholic.
Li Yuanping paused, his expression puzzled. He opened his mouth slightly and said in a low voice, "The ancestor and Uncle Ling both have such excellent temperaments. How could it be that in the later generations..."
Li Qingxiao gave him a look, signaling him to stop, and hinted, "Brother Yuanyun left the mountain years ago and went to Eastern Mount Yue, saying that he was looking for a shamanic method to open up spiritual orifices. He has not returned for several years..."
Both fell silent. Everyone knew that Li Yuanyun had no spiritual orifice but no one dared to mention it, treating it like a taboo. Among the direct descendants, he lived the most aimless life.
However, they all understood that if there were truly a method to open spiritual orifices, it would not be found in a small region like Eastern Mount Yue, nor would it be easily accessible.
Li Yuanping sighed and said, "Uncle Xuanling has gone to travel in Xu State, and Big Sister is cultivating in seclusion. The elders feel guilty toward him and never impose any restrictions on him; they always let him do as he pleases. There's nothing we can do too… I also discussed this with Big Brother, but he suggested we just let him be. As long as he doesn't do anything bad or harm people by performing blood sacrifices while he collects shamanic spells in Eastern Mount Yue, and if it can alleviate his frustration and resentment, it might actually be a good thing."
Li Qingxiao sighed softly and murmured, "I guess that's true..."
