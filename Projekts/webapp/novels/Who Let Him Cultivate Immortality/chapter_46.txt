Chapter 46: The Ten Bulls Strength Pill!
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Before the trio could react, they heard the sound of trees collapsing in the rain, as if something was rushing towards them through the rain.
Boom—
The large object in the rain didn’t slow down and directly crashed into a wall of the mountain god temple, putting the temple at risk of collapse!
A colorful fierce tiger, slightly smaller than the tiger demon, stood in front of the three. Despite its smaller size, it gave off an even more ferocious vibe!
There were a male and a female tiger in this mountain!
This was something nobody expected.
There was too little information about the beasts of Song Mountain. Before this, it was uncertain whether there were any demon clans hiding here, let alone two of them.
“Wife, let’s go together,” the male tiger demon said. The female tiger demon, only slightly weaker than him with a late Foundation Establishment cultivation, made them confident in facing the three humans.
“Useless.” The female tiger demon muttered, embarrassing the male tiger demon.
The dual assault from the tigers significantly increased the pressure on the trio.
“Attack the one with the sword; he’s the hardest to deal with,” the male tiger demon roared.
Meng Jingzhou was immediately dissatisfied, making his presence felt at the forefront: “What do you mean? Am I inferior to him?”
“I thought you, a demon, had some discernment, but it turns out you’re not only henpecked but also can’t judge the strength of your enemies. You’re disgracing the demon race. With this level, you dare to claim the mountain as your king. Look at my golden body, hard and unbeatable in defense at our level. Can you break through my defense…”
The male tiger demon paused for a moment: “Attack this golden guy; he’s the most annoying.”
The two tigers struck together, sending Meng Jingzhou flying into a wall, forming a “big” character.
The tigers frowned, feeling that the hand feel of hitting him was off.
Meng Jingzhou’s chest revealed a sesame pancake, fractured into four parts, with a quarter missing—eaten by Meng Jingzhou himself.
Honestly, it tasted good.
Just as Meng Jingzhou was about to counterattack, a figure in green rushed into the temple, holding the old hunter by the neck, rapidly reciting the Rebirth Mantra, eliminating the harmful old hunter.
It was the green-dressed girl who had wanted to come in for shelter from the rain.
The green-dressed girl, seeing the standoff and Meng Jingzhou embedded in the wall, was slightly surprised.
She had rushed here upon hearing the fight, wanting to see the situation, and encountered the old hunter in his true form.
She didn’t think twice before running towards this side with the old hunter, not expecting such a lively scene.
Aiding a tiger.
Seeing the tiger demon and the ghost, she quickly pieced together what had happened.
“Dao Seeking Sect, Lu Yang.” Lu Yang quickly identified himself.
“Moon Laurel Immortal Palace, Lan Ting.” The green-dressed girl and Lu Yang exchanged glances, reported their names, and quickly adjusted their mindset to join the battle.
Being from two of the Five Great Immortal Sects, they were supposed to help each other.
Lan Ting’s movements were graceful, with a white ribbon swirling around her arms, floating behind her. She moved lightly, like a fairy dancing in the moon, enchantingly beautiful.
“Form over substance!” The female tiger demon scorned Lan Ting’s moves, charging to tear the deceitful human apart.
Lan Ting didn’t respond verbally. With a light tap of her foot and fingers together, she pointed at the female tiger demon, the white ribbon stiffening into a sword, piercing directly at the tiger’s forehead.
The female tiger demon suffered a big loss right away but wasn’t scared, scoffing, “Just an early Foundation Establishment.”
Despite her words, the female tiger demon didn’t dare to be careless. Battling with a cultivator from a great sect, a slight mistake could lead to death.
Lan Ting might not defeat the female tiger demon, but she could temporarily entangle it.
Meanwhile, the scene shifted back to the Dao Seeking Sect trio battling the male tiger demon.
Lu Yang’s swordsmanship was extremely tricky, leaving the tiger demon unable to guard effectively.
Barbarian Bone took Meng Jingzhou off the wall, pushing the tiger demon back continuously.
Meng Jingzhou… had no thoughts on being used as a weapon.
Seeing this, the tiger demon’s forehead “king” character shone brighter, and the hidden blood of the mythical Qiongqi within was stimulated, elongating its fangs and claws, becoming more ferocious.
“What luck, to have Qiongqi bloodline.” Lu Yang was somewhat speechless; how many trump cards did this demon have?
Was it their bad luck, or were all demons this capable?
Lu Yang couldn’t help but think of the great era’s arrival mentioned by the eldest sister.
With the arrival of the great era, all sorts of demons and ghosts would emerge to share the Central Continent.
Though the tiger demon’s abilities were far from participating in the great era’s struggles, its appearance was a minor manifestation of the great era’s arrival.
After stimulating the Qiongqi bloodline, the tiger demon completely lost its rationality, relying on instinct in battle, its eyes bloodshot and frenzied, but its combat skills significantly improved.
Barbarian Bone’s barbarian blood seemed stimulated, awakening as well, swinging Meng Jingzhou with increasing force.
“We can’t drag this out any longer.” Lu Yang thought, uncertain what else the tiger demon could pull off. Better to end everything quickly.
With that thought, Lu Yang flipped his palm, revealing a golden pill.
It was the pill he exchanged after completing the Painted Skin Ghost mission, the Ten Bulls Strength Pill.
Consuming this pill grants the strength of ten bulls!
Although the people of Pellet Cauldron Peak were unreliable in both poison and pill making, they never skimped on the effects of their pills.
This pill was undoubtedly a top contender among strength exploding pills!
With his swordsmanship and the addition of ten bulls’ strength, let alone a trace of Qiongqi bloodline in the tiger demon, even a pure-blooded Qiongqi he would dare to fight!
Seizing the moment Barbarian Bone and Meng Jingzhou teamed up to hold the male tiger demon, Lu Yang no longer hesitated and swallowed the pill.
So hot, such a burning sensation!
Swallowing the pill felt like ingesting a ball of fire, his stomach burning intensely.
Lu Yang closed his eyes, feeling his dantian heating up, with endless strength emerging from within, forming lines that appeared on his body’s surface.
Barbarian Bone noticed Lu Yang’s change; his body outlined with red lines, reminiscent of the barbarian warriors he had seen in books, daring to fight against heaven and earth.
“So strong!” Even Barbarian Bone, a straightforward man, could feel the power emanating from Lu Yang.
This power was undoubtedly invincible among Foundation Establishment cultivators.
The male tiger demon attempted to stop Lu Yang’s transformation but was jointly held back by Barbarian Bone and Meng Jingzhou.
Lu Yang opened his eyes, a hint of confusion in his gaze. The power indeed surged out, but it seemed all to flow outwards, leaving little within him.
Red lines spread from Lu
Yang’s body to the ground, forming a strange circular pattern.
A thick smoke rose from the ground, obscuring the view.
The smoke came quickly and dissipated just as fast. After the smoke cleared, ten water buffaloes appeared before everyone.
These ten water buffaloes were all at the Foundation Establishment stage!
Lu Yang: “?”
The male tiger demon: “?”
Everyone present was stunned by this sudden change, unclear about what had happened.
“Damn your Ten Bulls Strength Pill!”
This wasn’t a pill to enhance one’s own strength at all, but a pill with an embedded summoning formation!
These ten water buffaloes, as if knowing what Lu Yang summoned them for, scuffed the ground with their hooves, their eyes red, and charged at the tiger demon as one!
