“Moo! Moo! Moo!”
The big black ox let out an enraged bellow, giving Chen Xun a fierce nudge. "Moo! Moo!!"
“Unlock your divine aperture. Stop suppressing yourself—go and transcend the tribulation.”
Chen Xun smiled faintly and abruptly delivered a swift kick. The big black ox yelped in surprise as it was sent hurtling toward the distant horde of vile beasts. Even as it disappeared from sight, it could still hear Chen Xun’s wild laughter echoing behind it.
Once the big black ox vanished from view, Chen Xun called out, “Little Red.”
“Brother Xun!”
Little Red’s eyes widened with concern, and it hurriedly stepped into the air. Anxiety and unease gnawed at its heart. It had always felt that Brother Ox wasn’t as powerful as Brother Xun.
“Take out the fabric we bought in town. I’m making some clothes.”
“Oh, oh, alright.”
Momentarily stunned, Little Red realized what was going on. Brother Xun’s clothes had been destroyed by the heavenly tribulation. Since they weren’t enchanted items, they couldn’t withstand such power.
“Don’t worry about Brother Ox. Its physical body is only slightly weaker than mine by three fractions,” Chen Xun said casually as he began crafting the garments, boasting effortlessly. “This heavenly tribulation won’t pose it any threat whatsoever.”
Little Red blinked and nodded, inching closer to Chen Xun. The weather was shifting ominously, and that terrifying heavenly might was beginning to descend once again.
It had never heard of cultivators needing to undergo tribulations to break through, but it dared not question. It wasn’t even curious, just deeply afraid.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
The wind rose.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Thunder clouds gathered in the skies, mirroring the situation Chen Xun had faced earlier. From deep underground came a resounding rumble that felt even more overwhelming than the thunder clouds above.
Chen Xun and Little Red both looked toward the ground, their eyelids twitching as they sensed the absurdity of it all.
Boom!
Before long, a massive, world-shaking bolt of lightning pierced through the heavens and earth, striking directly at the big black ox suspended mid-air!
The vile beasts below howled in despair and anger as they turned to ash beneath the mighty heavenly tribulation. Their lingering resentment seemed to curse: That big black ox has no shred of decency!
Vile beasts within a thousand-mile radius of the big black ox began fleeing all together. The air reverberated with violent turbulence.
Creatures of various levels emerged like poisonous mushrooms after a storm, scattering across the ground. Those who had initially fled to this area were once again embarking on a journey of escape, reliving the cycle of beginnings and endings.
Their hearts were filled with exasperation: Will this heavenly might ever end?!
Those too slow to flee were obliterated by the unending sea of lightning, their souls scattered without even a chance to scream.
The big black ox’s pupils gradually grew unfocused as it was dragged into a heart-devouring illusion.
A crimson sun hung high in the sky, casting endless golden rays that pierced through drifting clouds and mist.
A few beams of sunlight filtered into the courthouse, illuminating a man and a big black ox, both kneeling in submission and crying out, “We’ve been wronged!”
“How dare you, Chen Xun! To think you and this ox would desecrate another’s ancestral grave! Such an unpardonable sin cannot be forgiven!”
The righteous magistrate’s voice boomed with authority as he struck the table with a resounding thud. “Exile to the frontier! Ten years of hard labor!”
“Moo?”
The big black ox’s muddled gaze snapped wide open. “Moo! Moo! Moo!”
Chen Xun hung his head in despair, staring at the ground with a defeated air. His shoes were riddled with holes. At just twenty years old, he hadn’t expected his life to reach such a tragic end. He didn’t know if he’d ever make it back alive.
Dragged off by soldiers, the two began their journey to the frontier the next day—a truly desolate and bitter land. From what they heard, no one had ever returned from there.
The big black ox, its intelligence dulled, loyally followed Chen Xun without a thought, accepting its fate.
They traveled onward, passing mountains and seas, encountering fierce beasts and mountain bandits along the way. Chen Xun drew two mighty axes and stood protectively in front of the big black ox, joining the soldiers to fend off the attackers.
“Old Ox, stay behind me, and don’t wander off!”
“Moo! Moo!”
The big black ox’s gaze was resolute as it fixed on that upright figure ahead. Wherever he went, it would follow.
In the days that followed, it worked alongside Chen Xun to build city walls. Many praised the ox for its intelligence, though some harbored ulterior motives toward it.
Little did they know, Chen Xun possessed strength akin to an ox, natural-born power, and a commanding presence with three axes strapped to him. With a ripped physique boasting sixteen abs, a sharp sense of people’s feelings, and a knack for reasoning, he was not someone to be trifled with.
Five years later, Chen Xun had become the leader of the laborers. Wherever he went, people respectfully called him “Brother Xun.”
That night.
Chen Xun sneaked out with a stash of food, including some meat. Hiding in a corner, he took out the meat and looked at the big black ox. “Old Ox, you eat first!”
“Moo! Moo!!” The big black ox nudged Chen Xun and insisted they eat together.
“Heh heh.” Chen Xun grinned slyly. “Don’t worry, I already ate with Brother Zhang and the others. You’ve been hauling things all day and must be exhausted. Eat more.”
“Moo~” The big black ox finally relaxed at his assurance and eagerly began eating.
“This world is home to immortals, so we must tread carefully and avoid offending them,” Chen Xun said, his sharp eyes scanning the surroundings. “Word is, two nations are about to go to war. That’s why they’re making us build these walls every day.”
“Moo~ Moo~”
The big black ox smiled warmly, unconcerned. It was content as long as it could follow Chen Xun—nothing else mattered, not even if the sky were to fall.
“Don’t worry, Old Ox. With my natural strength, we’ll return to our countryside in another five years!”
“Moo! Moo!”
The big black ox unintentionally smeared some grease onto Chen Xun’s back. Enraged, he immediately licked it clean, lamenting how such precious flavor shouldn’t go to waste.
The ox let out a startled cry, insisting it wasn’t on purpose.
“Haha, no loss is a gain. Meat always tastes better,” Chen Xun said, licking his lips in delight. “Hurry and eat, Old Ox. Don’t let anyone catch us.”
“Moo!” The big black ox quickened its pace, curling its tongue to devour the meat in one gulp.
Under the dark, windy night, the two sneaky figures returned to their quarters without arousing any suspicion.
Two years later.
War broke out between the two nations, and the laborers at the border were forcibly conscripted as cannon fodder. Refusal meant death!
Chen Xun and the big black ox were horrified. They were only three years away from returning home; why now?!
Neither dared to become deserters. The world was vast, but there would be no place to hide. Even immortals might hunt them down.
The battlefield roared with intensity.
Chen Xun gripped his twin axes tightly, standing among the cannon fodder ranks, while the big black ox nervously stayed by his side.
“March!”
“March!”
Outside the camp, dust billowed into the sky. Warhorses neighed as soldiers with sharp gazes scrutinized the cannon-fodder troops. Anyone attempting to flee would disrupt morale and face execution—along with their entire village.
Fear and despair filled everyone’s eyes. Was this not a march to death?
Chaos broke out in the cannon-fodder camp as soldiers drove them forward onto the battlefield.
“Old Ox, charge!”
Chen Xun shouted, mounting the big black ox as they charged forward with unrelenting determination.
“Moo! Moo!”
The big black ox bellowed, fearlessly storming into the battlefield.
Arrows rained down from the sky, their long, sharp tips slicing through the air like a swarm of locusts. One after another, cannon-fodder soldiers fell, struck down mid-charge.
