Li Xuanfeng crossed borders on his conspicuous jade ship and soon entered the territory of the Profound Peak Gate.
While the Azure Pond Sect had its own coastal access, the path to the Eastern Sea through Profound Peak's Lake Xian was far closer to Splitreed Island. Going through the southern exit of Azure Pond Sect would involve a long detour, so Li Xuanfeng had opted to travel through Profound Peak Sect's land instead.
As Shanji Prefecture, controlled by Profound Peak Gate, came into view, a white barrier appeared before them. Li Xuanfeng halted the jade ship, and soon, a Profound Peak disciple rode the wind up to greet them. He displayed utmost courtesy as he asked softly, "May I ask, Senior…"
The elder Ning brother stepped forward and replied, "From Azure Pond, escorting disciples to Splitreed Island."
Li Xuanfeng took a step forward, tapped his belt, and a jade token shot out from the beast-head buckle, radiating a brilliant light in midair.
The Profound Peak disciple, an elderly man dressed in white with well-defined features and moles on each cheek, was adorned with various jade accessories. Bowing respectfully, he said hurriedly, "Junior Kong Yu greets Senior! Please… please follow me to the lake!"
His deference was evident as he led the way, sneaking glances at Li Xuanfeng with a hint of hesitation before stammering, "Is this Senior… could you be the famed Golden Bowstring of the Southern Border? You match the description so closely…"
Li Xuanfeng was not surprised to be recognized so easily and nodded slightly. Kong Yu instantly grew excited, exclaiming, "Senior, I am Kong Yu of Profound Peak! Our gate has long been allied with the Li Family! I even visited Moongaze Lake to help Qingdu relocate a mountain. I am quite close with Daoist Xuanxuan…"
Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow in mild surprise, his expression softening significantly as he responded gently, "Oh? My elder brother?"
A faint smile appeared on Li Xuanfeng's face as he asked, "I have not seen him in many years… How is my elder brother doing these days?"
"Well… he is quite well!"
Under Li Xuanfeng's gaze, Kong Yu felt a sudden pang of nervousness. After two hasty replies, he elaborated, "Daoist Xuanxuan has reached late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm and has grown more adept with talismans. He has never been much for combat, but his skills in talisman arts are increasingly profound…"
"We traveled west together back then, discussing so much along the way. I learned a great deal," Kong Yu murmured as Li Xuangfeng looked off into the distance, listening quietly.
Kong Yu, digging through his memory, suddenly remembered another detail and quickly added, "And I heard… I heard that your clan even went overseas and, along with Profound Peak's Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, launched a counterattack on Situ Mo, nearly obliterating that monk from the Wrathful Dao Lineage!"
"A counterattack..? Situ Mo? A Golden Tang Gate disciple?" Li Xuanfeng repeated as he frowned.
The Southern Border was often cut off from outside news. Li Xuanfeng, though he had received one update from home through Liu Changdie, knew little overall. Most of his information came through Ning Family channels.
The Ning Family was effective at gathering news, but they could not uncover everything, especially the more private matters. Kong Yu, on the other hand, had heard this news through Kong Tingyun, which explained why Li Xuanfeng had been unaware.
Li Xuanfeng's interest was instantly piqued as he caught onto the essential details and asked further, prompting Kong Yu to relay what he had learned from Kong Tingyun.
"Yes, a Golden Tang Gate disciple! Apparently, Situ Mo somehow incurred your family's wrath and colluded with the Wrathful Dao Lineage in the north, setting an ambush for your family's younger members. Fortunately, the Li Family's Foundation Establishment Realm experts arrived in time, preventing any mishap…"
Kong Yu continued, "Later, when your family needed to go to the Eastern Sea, they teamed up with our Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Kong Tingyun, for the journey. It just so happened that they encountered those two on the way, and in the ensuing battle, that monk…"
Kong Yu summarized the event. When he described Situ Mo's ambush, Li Xuanfeng's eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of anger lighting up his gaze.
By the time Kong Yu finished, however, Li Xuanfeng's expression had settled into a quiet calm, revealing no trace of emotion as he murmured evenly, "How bold."
Though spoken softly, his tone sent a chill through Kong Yu, who watched as Li Xuanfeng asked, "Is Situ Mo currently in the Eastern Sea?"
"He is indeed!" Kong Yu nodded eagerly, pleased with himself as he responded, "He is on Golden Sack Island in the Scarlet Pristine Sea. Just head east from here, and you will find it easily with a few inquiries."
Li Xuanfeng nodded, standing with his hands clasped behind him with his Black Gold Spirit Armor gleaming in the sunlight, his robes billowing around him. A few names crossed his mind, and he muttered coldly, "Situ Mo… Guo Hongyao…"
It would be best if they stayed hidden in Yue State or on Crimson Reef Island... Because if I catch them in the Eastern Sea, they will learn the true taste of being pierced by thousands of arrows from head to toe!
As murderous intent surged in his heart, the old man before him, Kong Yu, felt a chilling sensation, as though his face were being slashed by knives. Terrified, he dared not speak.
As for Kong Yu, he is clearly using me as a blade here!
Li Xuanfeng glanced briefly at the old man, though he was not particularly concerned. These enemies were shared adversaries, and this news was useful. Li Xuanfeng knew exactly how to handle it.
For Li Xuanxuan's sake, he remained courteous, though even this restrained glance left Kong Yu visibly uneasy. The old man quickly tried to amend his words, adding, "But Situ Mo is a core disciple of the Golden Tang Gate; regardless of his strength, it would be unwise to cause too much trouble. If you intend to deal with him, Senior, a light punishment may be best…"
Li Xuanfeng nodded as he leaned on the edge of the ship, conversing politely yet absently. As they left Lake Xian, Kong Yu finally bid them farewell, "This is as far as this old man will escort you! The rest of your journey is your own."
"Thank you, Fellow Daoist!" replied the elder Ning brother, nodding in acknowledgment.
Seeing Kong Yu's familiarity with Li Xuanfeng, he remained polite as Kong Yu turned away, sweat beading on his brow as he flew off, thinking to himself, That was close! Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanxuan are like night and day! How can they even be brothers… they are worlds apart!
To Kong Yu, Li Xuanxuan was like a mild, aging rabbit—though easily startled by even the slightest stir, he was serious, easy to talk to, and lacked any intimidating presence.
They had not spent long together, but Kong Yu had felt a genuine sense of rapport, understanding the man well.
Li Xuanfeng, however, was like a hawk, polite on the surface but brimming with a fierce edge. Especially when the topic of Situ Mo's ambush on Li Family juniors had come up, a single flicker of Li Xuanfeng's gaze had felt like a blade cutting across his face.
If he were merely a lone eagle, it might not be so concerning… but this man has endured the bitter winds of the Southern Border for decades, sharpening his claws to razor edges. Besides… he has built himself a nest within the mighty Ning Family—he's truly terrifying!
Watching the emerald jade ship disappear into the distance, Kong Yu thought quietly, In less than ten years, Yue State will be buzzing with tales of this great eagle! Three generations back to back… the Li Family truly has people of talent, no wonder they are thriving!
Returning to his peak on the wind, deep in thought, Kong Yu hurried to rummage through his storage and pulled out a talisman, tracing it with meticulous detail.
"Oh right, I should let Tingyun know! She might be able to find a way to establish contact with the Li Family. It would be best if they could push Situ Mo back to Yue State; this would also be a good opportunity to earn the Li Family's favor!"
The old man, well over a century in age and adept in such matters, quickly recorded his message in the talisman and called someone over.
"Go! Deliver this to Yuezhou Island!"
