Li Qinghong walked alone at the mountain summit, her white deerskin boots crunching the perennial snow underfoot. She brushed her loose hair behind her ears and walked with her hands clasped behind her back.
"Grandfather… I wonder how he is," Li Qinghong wondered out loud as she pressed her lips together and pondered to herself.
It's only been three years… Grandfather is likely still refining his cultivation. Breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm is a life-and-death ordeal; it's not easy.
"Sister Qinghong!" Fei Tongxiao trotted up behind Li Qinghong, smiling as he was about to speak. However, he didn't expect the grand formation of Glacial Cloud Peak to slowly activate, and a strong voice reverberated across the peak.
"Rogue cultivator Wan has come to visit. Please open the mountain gate, Senior!"
These words brought a smile to Li Qinghong's lips, and her almond-shaped eyes widened in surprise as she murmured with joy, "It's grandfather!"
Fei Tongxiao, standing behind her, stiffened. His heart felt empty, but he forced a smile and stepped forward. "Congratulations, Senior Sister!" he said, feigning excitement.
Li Tongya descended on Glacial Cloud Peak, where Fei Wangbai greeted him warmly. Wearing a silver-white brocade robe, he looked even more handsome in the falling snow. With a cupped fist, he said, "Congratulations on your breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, truly transcending the mundane!"
"You're too kind, Senior!"
Li Tongya's attire was much simpler this time, a gray robe with white cloud-patterned sleeves and a long sword on his back. He did not appear smug about his achievement but politely cupped his fist and answered, "I am here to disturb you again today… I apologize for the trouble."
The two of them stepped into an elegant pavilion on the mountainside and sat down on the white jade terrace at the top floor. Fei Wangbai swung his sleeves, shaking off the snowflakes, and smiled.
"Congratulations, Brother Tongya!"
Li Tongya joined him and accepted the tea. He took a slow sip before smiling warmly. "I have been in seclusion for three years and only now see your handiwork, Senior… The Yu Family was completely caught off guard."
"Ah." Fei Wangbai laughed heartily and shook his head.
"It is just a precaution my father put in place years ago. The Yu Family did not anticipate it and suffered a great loss. When Yu Yufeng broke through to the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, my father, who led the household, sensed that something was amiss. He went to the Milin's mountain ranges and chose several locations where earth veins converged. He spent a few years planting secret formation points and buried nine talismans in each one… When my father returned, he sought me out and said, 'The Yu Family grows ever stronger, but I left these formations to shake the earth veins of the Milin mountains. They may be useful one day.' Not long after, he attempted a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm but perished, and the formations remained undiscovered until the Yu Family surveyed the earth veins and built a market there."
"I see!" Li Tongya nodded and praised, "Your father was truly farsighted."
Fei Wangbai sighed and shook his head before continuing solemnly, "As for the Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator on the eastern shore, he is a friend of mine. He is at the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm and is only staying here to give Yu Mugao a scare."
After putting down his teacup, Fei Wangbai chuckled softly before a hint of puzzlement crossed his face.
"It took me five years to break through, and Yu Xiaogui needed over five years as well… but Brother Tongya… you managed it in just three years. It really is surprising! Truly, you are a man of exceptional talent."
Li Tongya maintained a serious demeanor and cupped his fist, humbly saying, "It is mostly due to the Essence Gathering Pill. Senior's praise is too kind… I am unworthy of it."
"Oh!" Fei Wangbai had never seen an Essence Gathering Pill, so he listened credulously. He quickly shook his head and laughed. "You are good in every way but too humble. According to proper etiquette, you can just call me Wangbai… Calling me 'Senior' makes me feel rather old!"
Li Tongya couldn't help but laugh and shook his head, unable to resist Fei Wangbai. He conceded and said seriously, "Wangbai, just as you did not expect, Yu Xiaogui won't expect it either. This is an excellent opportunity to suppress the Yu Family!"
Fei Wangbai also became excited and placed his white jade teacup down, saying softly, "Fellow cultivator He from the western shore has been wary of the Yu Family for a long time. If we call upon my friend as well, the four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators can make the Yu Family suffer a significant loss! Of course, that is not to mention any other reinforcements Brother Tongya might bring along as well!"
Li Tongya nodded as snowflakes drifted past him. "This cultivator He… is he the Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator, Daoist He, from the western shore?" he asked.
The families on the western shore were mostly small clans at the Embryonic Breathing Realm, scattered like stars, but one Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator named Daoist He stood out.
With no children of his own, he built a small temple in the mountains and took in six or seven disciples, collecting tributes from the families. Daoist He had a close friend in the Azure Pond Sect who served as a protector and had little ambition, content with living among the western shore families.
"That's right," Fei Wangbai replied, laughing. "This Daoist He has a longstanding grudge against Yu Yufeng, the Yu Family's ancestor in seclusion. It is said that Yu Yufeng once took away an opportunity from Daoist He, and he has been resentful ever since, troubling the Yu Family repeatedly. Later, when Yu Muxian joined the Azure Pond Sect, someone came down to mediate and the conflict stopped."
Li Tongya suddenly understood and nodded silently. Fei Wangbai extended a finger and said softly, "But… we cannot ignore Yu Muxian. He is still a disciple of a high sect, though it is unclear how highly he is regarded there. Brother Tongya, could you ask the Sword Immortal? We should align our actions with the situation."
"I understand." Li Tongya nodded calmly and tapped the white jade table before answering, "My fourth brother once cultivated within the peak. The Qi Cultivation Realm disciples of the immortal sect do not wield much power, but they do protect their family's bloodline. As long as Yu Muxian has not reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, and we are not planning to wipe out the Yu Family, there should not be too much trouble."
Li Tongya, naturally cautious, thought for a few breaths before shaking his head.
"Nonetheless, I will first ask someone to look into the situation."
Fei Wangbai nodded with satisfaction and extended a finger, speaking softly, "Do we kill the old one… or the young one?"
Li Tongya raised an eyebrow before stroking his chin, a smile slowly appearing.
"Patience, Brother Wangbai… If we are confident enough, we could even kill their ancestor."
Fei Wangbai nodded thoughtfully. The two chatted briefly as the wind and snow on the mountainside grew heavier, making the scene obscure.
The snowflakes slid away from the two of them, and Fei Wangbai smiled. "I have not made a move in years… and I am itching to fight. Brother Tongya, how about a little sparring?" He grinned.
Li Tongya raised an eyebrow with a confident smile.
"Sure."
As soon as this word left his mouth, the two soared into the air. Fei Wangbai's silver-white brocade robe fluttered lightly in the falling snow and he smiled.
"Since this is a friendly sparring match, I will show my immortal foundation."
Fei Wangbai's two white brocade sashes fluttered in the air as he stood tall and handsome, proclaiming, "This is Patterned Brocade!"
His silver-white brocade robe swirled in the air, and he tied a cloak with crescent moon patterns around his shoulders. He swept his spear outward, sending a fierce energy wave toward Li Tongya.
"Boundless Ocean!"
As Li Tongya spoke, the waterfall and springs at the foot of the mountain roared to life. The clear river water leaped up as if given life, surging toward the sky above Li Tongya immediately at his command.
Clink Clink Clink Clink…
Fei Wangbai's long spear, wrapped in a silver-white qi, had not yet struck before dozens of water swords flew toward it, striking like falcons pouncing on their prey.
Fei Wangbai chuckled softly and whirled his spear, spinning his cloak in the air. The water swords missed and were swept behind the cloak. Li Tongya raised an eyebrow, grasping the sword at his waist. Seeing Fei Wangbai charge forward, he drew his sword.
A moon-white arc leaped from Li Tongya's sword. Fei Wangbai had heard that Li Tongya's sword draw was especially remarkable, so he used his spear to block the incoming slash swiftly. He was forced backward a single step but absorbed the rest of the force with his cloak.
The subsequent sword strikes poured down like torrential rain on Fei Wangbai, who didn't back down. His spear danced like pear blossoms, blocking each sword.
He would strike from beneath his robe or behind his cloak occasionally, interrupting Li Tongya's sword moves and gaining time to catch his breath.
Below, some on the mountainside poked their heads out to watch. The two separated after the initial clash, but the heavy wind and snow obscured their figures in the air.
The Fei Family disciples below could only sense the Foundation Establishment Realm aura, but couldn't see them through the snowy sky.
