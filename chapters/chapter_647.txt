Li Xizhi waited at the altar for a while. Among the crowd, only he had received the talisman seed but had yet to accept a talisman qi. As expected, a brilliant light soon rose from the Shenyang Mansion.
"Rainbow Pierce Skyway." His aura surged instantly, and his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation level rapidly advanced. The rainbow light radiating from his body grew brighter, giving him an ethereal and immortal appearance.
However, the gaps between the stages of the Foundation Establishment Realm were vast. While such an increase in cultivation might have elevated someone several levels within the Qi Cultivation Realm, it merely brought him to the edge of breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. He stopped just short of the threshold.
Li Xizhi closed his eyes, muttering softly. When he exhaled, a plume of rainbow light dispersed. As he opened his eyes, the swirling rainbow hues within them slowly faded away.
Glancing at the crowd's awestruck gazes, he chuckled and said, "Just one step away from a breakthrough! It is actually a good thing—not rushing through this stage will avoid drawing suspicion. This way, I can refine my cultivation and practice spells during my trip to the Eastern Sea, before seizing the opportunity to break through."
After revealing his cultivation level, Li Xizhi explained the effects of the talisman qi he had received. Feeling inspired, he exercised his mana, causing rainbow light to dance across his fingertips. With a few hand seals, his middle and ring fingers curled into his palm while the rest pointed outward, forming a tripod-like shape.
In an instant, the spiritual energy flowing across the mountain ceased and froze in midair. After a brief pause, it rushed toward his hands in a concentrated surge, colliding and transforming into streams of white qi.
"Quite an improvement!" Li Xizhi praised himself as Li Ximing, standing nearby, gazed at him with bright eyes.
Li Ximing exclaimed, "Elder brother truly had foresight! Receiving the blessing at the Foundation Establishment Realm is indeed more beneficial. The rest of the family can follow your example in the future."
Li Xizhi smiled and replied, "Ximing, you are exaggerating. I can afford to take my time cultivating within the sect, but you all must focus on forming your Immortal Foundations quickly to support the family and secure greater benefits. You cannot afford to wait until Foundation Establishment Realm."
Shifting to a more serious tone, he said, "I have seen Zhouwei."
Concerned about how the family might handle things, Li Xizhi repeated the instructions he had given to Li Chengliao earlier. He warned gravely, "In ancient times, directly calling someone by their name was taboo, which is why Daoist titles exist. Once he begins cultivating at six, the family must give him a Daoist title, preferably related to Bright Yang, as it would be most beneficial to him."
He continued, "I am not only heading to the sect to find perception techniques to conceal his unique eyes. I will also take on additional assignments and build connections, exchanging for more Bright Yang techniques derived from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven for his protection and cultivation."
Li Xuanxuan adjusted his sleeves and spoke with some discomfort, "Kid… there is no need to burden yourself like this. Focus on your own cultivation. These things should not fall to you. Yu Muxian cultivated for years and exhausted almost all of the Yu family's wealth, but you have never once asked for anything from the family all these years. Your father and I only worried you might face hardships in the sect…"
Li Xizhi waved his hand dismissively, his expression resolute. "Grandfather, please do not treat me like a guest. Back when the family sought Dawn Colored Qi for me, I am sure you were not thinking about these details. Overthinking distinctions like these would make things meaningless!"
Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan could only nod. Li Xizhi, mindful of the time he had already spent away from Green Pine Island, dared not linger further. He spoke softly, "Time is pressing. I will return overseas immediately. Should anything arise in the family, feel free to send me a message."
The family members escorted him out together. Having only recently grown closer to her brother, Li Yuexiang showed some reluctance to part. In a soft voice, she asked, "Brother, how long will it be before you return?"
Li Xizhi smiled and replied, "Several years at least. If you have the time, feel free to have someone escort you to Green Pine Island. Not only is it a great place for cultivation, but we siblings could also spend some quality time together."
Li Yuexiang nodded, her interest clearly piqued. With a hint of playfulness, she added, "Brother, while you are out, could you also find me a suitable husband?"
Taking her words to heart, Li Xizhi nodded solemnly and said, "Father is no longer here, and as the eldest brother, I stand in his place. I will ensure Xiang'er is never wronged."
With that, he cupped his fist in farewell to the group. A rainbow-colored radiance rose beneath his feet, and in a flash, he disappeared into the eastern horizon.
As soon as Li Xizhi departed, Li Qinghong returned, riding the wind back to the peak, her clothes dusty from the journey. She retrieved a jade bottle from her robe and displayed it, saying, "This spirit water is called Central Azure Pool, part of the Pristine Water system. It cost ninety-seven spirit stones."
Li Qinghong had taken one hundred spirit stones when she left and returned three. With the five types of spirit water now gathered, Li Xuanxuan hurried to summon Liu Changdie.
For the past few days, Liu Changdie had been surveying Mount Qingdu, analyzing the flow of the earth's veins and spiritual energy. He had initially thought it would take months, if not years, to gather the materials. Seeing how quickly the Li Family had secured the five types of spirit water, he was slightly surprised.
Taking the jade bottles in hand, he examined them, "Converging Water: Far-Sea Serpent Stream and Forest Cold Water, Valley Water: Stone-Heart Water, Mansion Water: White Feather No-Fall, and Pristine Water: Central Azure Pool."
Liu Changdie beamed with excitement and remarked, "This is quite the collection! You are only missing a Pit Water for the Five Virtues to be complete."
Noticing everyone's curious glances, he cupped his fist and explained, "You may not know, but the setup of this formation is quite particular. If all the spirit waters are of the same attribute, the formation's power is greatly enhanced. However, if the waters encompass the Five Virtues, the formation's effectiveness will be equally remarkable."
From his robe, Liu Changdie took out a jade bottle and said softly, "While traveling to train and cultivate the Spirit Eye Perception, which I acquired from your clan, I collected some Pure Essence Spirit Water. There are still two portions left, and this water belongs to the Pit Water system."
He swapped out the Far-Sea Serpent Stream from the Converging Water set, thus completing the Five Virtues collection. Seeing this, Li Xuanxuan's face lit up with delight as he said with a smile, "Many thanks, Master!"
Liu Changdie simply smiled without comment. He had previously traveled to the Eastern Sea, where he discovered a grotto heaven from his prior life and obtained a wealth of spirit resources. His storage pouch already contained various spirit waters covering the Five Virtues, which was why he had initially proposed the formation.
No matter which five types of spirit water the Li Family gathered, he already had a narrative prepared to justify his method. Receiving the spirit water, he handed over a registry and said, "I will begin setting up the formation immediately. These listed materials and soil must still be collected. I trust your clan can provide them."
Li Xuanxuan readily agreed, walking alongside Liu Changdie. Grasping his sleeve, he asked, "Master, that remaining portion of Pure Essence Spirit Water—does it still serve any purpose for you?"
Clearly, Li Xuanxuan wanted to purchase it for the younger generation of the Li Family to practice the Spirit Eye Perception. Liu Changdie understood immediately and chuckled, "If your clan desires it, I will gladly part with it."
Li Xuanxuan politely refused to take it freely, and the two descended the mountain while engaged in lively conversation. Though Liu Changdie had never met Li Xuanxuan in his previous life, he had become acquainted with him during his youth in this lifetime. Their shared stories about the past created a pleasant camaraderie.
On the mountain, the heavy rain gradually subsided, the storm clouds over the lake lightened, and faint glimpses of the sky emerged. At the horizon, a rosy dawn appeared, and a warm wind swept in from the north, dislodging the white mourning cloth hanging on the walls. The storm clouds finally dispersed, revealing the clear skies above.
