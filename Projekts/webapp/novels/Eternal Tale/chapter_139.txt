Chen Xun still practiced axe skills every day, while the big black ox continued to study formations, holding onto formation diagrams and learning continuously, benefiting from the experiences of their predecessors.
Their life-bound magic weapons also began to grow increasingly powerful, as they both worked tirelessly to push their limits.
Time passed silently, and the Qian Nation's cultivation world continued to advance.
To the north of the Wu Nation lay vast plateaus and rivers, with rugged mountains and numerous dangers. There were also many barbarians inhabiting the area, where there were no countries, not even sects.
A desert separated the Wu Nation from the northern region. There were stories of Golden Core cultivators from there attempting to cross the plateau but never returning.
Yet, this meant that the land remained undeveloped. The Top Ten Sects of the Qian Nation had been planning for many years to drive out the cultivation world of the Wu Nation. How could they possibly halt their progress?
The resources of the eastern small countries were of no interest to the ten major immortal sects, as they only reached the Golden Core stage at most.
What they wanted was not just the Golden Core stage but the legendary realm beyond it!
No one dared to venture into the southern region, where vast mountain ranges had been occupied by powerful monsters. Humans and monsters coexisted without conflict, so there was no need for war.
Only the northern region remained, a land unexplored by countless cultivators. Once the batch of barbaric cultivators there was expelled, it would become the territory of the Qian Nation's cultivation world.
More importantly, this land could serve as a springboard for further exploration and acquisition of more resources.
Furthermore, it would allow the extermination of the remaining remnants of the Wu Nation's cultivation world. The strategic plan had been set, with even other forces from various countries participating.
The three major forces of Yuxu City were also involved, and even during the attack on the Wu Nation's cultivation world, their shadows loomed.
Now that the rare resources in the cultivation world were gradually depleting, the upper echelons would never sit idly by. Expansion was the only way out for the Qian Nation's cultivation world.
Otherwise, they would only be waiting for death. Cultivating for thousands of years would amount to nothing but a big dream.
Now, the Top Ten Sects of the Qian Nation have begun to act. Such an expedition required unity among the people, so they first needed to integrate the domestic sects.
However, their actions were relatively subtle; they couldn't pressure other major sects too much. They had to be patient and persuasive, like boiling a frog in warm water, for long-term success.
In the sky outside the city, there were also many more giant ships, and the descending cultivators were all hurrying towards the West City.
It seemed that another great war sweeping through the cultivation world was brewing.
However, the outside world remained calm, with no hint of turmoil. Most cultivators were content with the current situation, and the Top Ten Sects didn't want to sow panic among the people of the Qian Nation.
People like Chen Xun and the big black ox were content with the status quo. Time passed by, and it had already been sixty years since the big black ox emerged from seclusion.
In the Yellow-grade cave, Chen Xun was still swinging his axe outside the cave, and the seasons flowed by with each swing. With the big black ox by his side, he felt extremely peaceful and serene.
Chen Xun worked tirelessly, each swing of the axe carrying a rhythm that seemed harmonious yet filled with reverence for nature. It didn't harm a single flower or blade of grass around him. The swing of the axe was silent, but the falling leaves could be heard.
Chen Xun slowly put down the axe, took a deep breath, and the transcendent aura about him gradually dissipated, returning to a state of normalcy.
"Old Ox."
"Moo~"
The big black ox sat at the entrance of the cave, tinkering with the formation. It quite enjoyed watching Chen Xun practice axe skills; it found it quite satisfying, even surpassing its own skills in singing and painting.
"Get ready; we're going to the auction to stock up." Chen Xun's eyes narrowed as he slowly pulled on the bandit's mask, covering his head. "If there's nothing left, don't blame me for going to rob. We'll cultivate them and return them when we're done!"
"Huff..." The big black ox exhaled heavily, its belly shaking as it leaned against the cave wall, tilting its head back and chuckling quietly. Its horns scraped against the cave wall, making a clattering sound.
"What's so funny, old ox?!" Chen Xun's expression turned slightly angry, feeling insulted. "I borrowed this; I'll just return two more!"
"Moo~" The big black ox's laughter grew louder and louder, pointing its hoof at Chen Xun's head covered by the mask, his eyes completely obscured by the mask.
"Damn..." Chen Xun was startled, releasing a surge of energy to condense into a mirror. "What?!" He quickly turned around. He hadn't worn the mask for a long time. How did it shrink? He hurriedly used the power of his Golden Core to change its appearance, then cleared his throat heavily.
"Old ox, when our strength is enough, we can visit the major sects." Chen Xun turned around with his hands behind his back, his eyes showing a friendly expression. "For example, helping them cultivate medicinal herbs to promote the development of our Qian Nation's cultivation world."
"Moo?!"
"Of course, when we have enough strength, everyone will reason with us. We were born here, going to do great things. Who dares to stop us?!" Chen Xun smiled faintly, patting himself. "Otherwise, what's the point of enhancing our strength? Just for self-preservation and freedom."
"Moo~~!" The big black ox was shocked, its heart pounding with excitement, without any doubt.
"Then in the future, won't tens of thousands of cultivators bow down and greet the ancestor ox?!"
"Moo!!"
"You can roam freely in the medicinal gardens of major sects, leaving behind the legend of your ancestor ox in each of them?!"
"Moo!!!"
The big black ox couldn't hold it anymore, it collapsed with a thud, its eyes dull, and its body limp. This was too exciting...
They had never done anything so thrilling in their lives.
Chen Xun snorted coldly, his expression still calm, but his heart was also pounding. This ox's words had stirred him up as well.
"Let's go, let's go to the auction and participate."
"Moo moo~"
They descended the mountain again, heading towards the central city area.
However, there was a hint of fantasy in their eyes, their steps were quite brisk, and drool occasionally slipped from their mouths.
The sound of bells rang out, signaling the start of the auction.
One day and one night later... Two figures fled in a sorry state, rushing out, spitting on the ground, and thousands of spiritual stones floated on the water.
Four months later... two figures returned with high spirits.
One day and one night later... Two figures fled in panic, rushing out again, spitting on the ground twice, and thousands of spiritual stones floated on the water.
Four months later... Two figures were full of ambition, rushing back.
During the middle of the auction, the old man on the stage suddenly took out a spiritual herb and spoke confidently:
"This is the Night White Mushroom, 700 years old. For friends in the Golden Core stage, it is definitely a treasure!"
The appearance of this mushroom was elegant and beautiful, making it perfect for viewing. It continuously emitted a faint aura of spiritual energy, and its medicinal properties were quite intact.
"I believe you are all very familiar with this spiritual herb, so I won't introduce it further." The old man chuckled and glanced around the rooms. "Although its age is not high, its medicinal properties are quite intact. And in terms of rarity, it is even more precious than the thousand-year-old spiritual herbs used by Golden Core stage cultivators. Starting price, thirty thousand low-grade spiritual stones."
As soon as the words fell, the room was filled with numerous twinkling lights. This item, when brought back to the sect for cultivation, would surely surpass a thousand years!
