On Wutu Peak, clouds and mist enveloped the surroundings entirely. Sunlight pierced through the pale white fog as a young man dressed in black exhaled slowly. Spiritual energy and qi flowed into his mouth like mist, competing to enter, creating a rather mystical scene.
"Whew..."
A beautiful young woman sat on a large rock nearby, dressed in jade armor. With a spear laid across her lap, absentmindedly reading the light-colored jade slip she held in her delicate hands. Tiny characters were finely engraved on the edge of the jade slip—Wing Clipper Spear technique.
The woman mimicked movements with her hands silently. The young man beside her let out a long breath, exhaling white mist. When he finally opened his eyes, the morning glow was slowly rising on the horizon. His face was full of worry as he said, "The ancestor has been gone for several days, and we have not heard any news."
Li Qinghong, who was beside him, put down the jade slip in her hand and picked up the spear on her lap. She then jumped down from the stone, saying sullenly, "Maybe I should go out and look for him!"
"No!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed as he quickly shook his head, getting up to stop her and saying solemnly, "When the ancestor left home, he specifically instructed me to take good care of you. I called you to Mount Wutu to guard you personally, precisely to prevent you from going out alone to look for him…"
Li Qinghong flipped her hand to put away the jade slip and shook her head with some frustration.
"Who can calm down like this?! I have read this spear technique from the Xiao Family over and over again, but I cannot help worrying about him. When you cultivate, you keep glancing at the sky, making no progress either!" she exclaimed in exasperation.
Li Yuanjiao shook his head and took out a warm jade from his bosom, which was dim and had faint cracks. Li Qinghong leaned over to look and opened her mouth, but no words came.
After the Li Family became a prestigious clan, Li Tongya had specially sought someone to craft this item. He initially wanted to use items like soul wood or soul lamps, which could indicate life or death, but was deterred by the high cost and could only opt for the relatively cheaper life jade.
As long as the life jade was nourished with a drop of blood for a certain period of time, it could show the life and death status of the blood donor. It was already quite expensive and required at least the power level of the Qi Cultivation Realm to use. Hence, only a few Qi Cultivators of the Xuan generation and Li Tongya had one made.
This item should have been in the ancestral hall. Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan took theirs to the market, and Li Xuanfeng's life jade had lost its effectiveness due to long neglect. Only Li Tongya's remained at home, and Li Yuanjiao had specifically taken it out and checked it from time to time.
Seeing the life jade dim and lifeless, the siblings exchanged a glance, seeing the worry in each other's eyes. Li Qinghong sighed deeply, her delicate brows furrowing as she said softly, "In the past, with Father and Grandfather guiding us, I always felt secure… Now that you and I must support the family, the path ahead seems dark and perilous, filling me with dread."
"Indeed!" Li Yuanjiao felt this most deeply among the children, as Li Tongya had personally entrusted the Li Family into his hands. When he took the jade box, it felt unbearably heavy, almost suffocating him.
After pondering for a moment, he said softly, "The effect of the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman is excellent. I am now at the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm! Within twenty years, I might hope to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm…"
Li Qinghong had just broken through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and hearing this, she was somewhat envious.
"No wonder it is a Foundation Establishment Realm talisman qi… It is truly remarkable. You used to cultivate slower than I did, but now you have surpassed me!" she commended.
As they were chatting, a young man who resembled Chen Donghe approached them. He looked to be about twenty years old but was already at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He was Chen Mufeng, Li Qiuyang's disciple, now transferred from the market to assist Li Yuanjiao.
"Young Master, Young Lady."
Chen Mufeng respectfully saluted and reported, "Young Master Yuanping requests your presence. He says there is news!"
"What?!"
The siblings were overjoyed, exchanging a glance before immediately taking flight toward Lijing Town, without saying another word.
Mount Wutu was not far from Lijing Town. Li Yuanjiao's Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit had the effect of manipulating clouds and mist, while Li Qinghong's Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow enhanced her flying speed. Hence, their flight was significantly faster than that of ordinary Qi Cultivators. They landed one after the other in the courtyard, where Li Yuanping had been waiting for some time and quickly came forward to greet them.
"Brother! Sister Hong! I have received news about our ancestor!"
Li Yuanping did not wait for them to ask questions and immediately shared the news he had received.
Li Yuanjiao was initially overjoyed as he heard the news, exclaiming repeatedly, "Good! Good!"
After thinking for a moment, doubt crossed his mind and his brows furrowed slightly.
"Can this news be trusted?"
"It is about seventy percent reliable…" Li Yuanping began, aware of the many doubts, and continued, "The ancestor calculated that it was a nine-out-of-ten chance of his death before he left, and surviving would be difficult. Who knew the news would spread like this… It does not seem like something a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator could achieve; if it were a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, it would be more believable…"
"Slaying a Maha Reincarnate…" Li Yuanjiao smiled bitterly and said, "Just think about it, and you will know it is impossible. What about the massive difference between a Maha and a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator? Besides, the Maha manipulates fate; if they die, it is likely a deliberate act… they are probably eager to reincarnate into the next life!"
Li Yuanjiao made a small joke amidst his bitterness. Li Qinghong, who idolized her grandfather, believed in the news almost completely, unable to suppress a smile as she said softly, "The Maha must have suffered a loss. Since the matter is settled and the life jade is not broken, we should wait quietly for the ancestor to return."
"That makes sense…" Li Yuanping nodded, seeing the life jade Li Yuanjiao held. With this, he gradually felt more at ease. After a few more quiet words, Li Qinghong spoke again.
"Now that the ancestor's reputation has spread, it will not be long before everyone knows about this. There will be grand celebrations proclaiming the Sword Immortal Clan, and families around the lake and nearby will come to congratulate us and bring us small gifts…"
Despite her words, Li Qinghong did not look pleased. Her delicate brows furrowed and the two brothers, Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping, exchanged worried looks with each other. Li Yuanping nodded and said, "The ancestor has not returned yet. With such fame, there will inevitably be some trouble… We will just have to accept the congratulatory gifts with stiff upper lips and adapt as we go along."
"That is a minor issue."
Li Yuanjiao rubbed the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword at his waist and said rather grimly, "What worries me more is that the ancestor has killed the Maha Reincarnate… Who knows how many Buddhist cultivators we have offended?!"
Upon hearing this, both nodded with a look of dread on their faces, clearly having anticipated this outcome. Li Yuanping sighed heavily and said in a muffled voice, "It will not be long before grandfather's reputation echoes throughout both Jiangnan and Jiangbei… Along the river, there are countless sword cultivators, rogue cultivators, and small Buddhist temples. Many troubles will arise from this!"
Li Yuanjiao glanced at his younger siblings and calmed the situation by saying, "Fortunately, the ancestor is safe. Let us wait and see how this turns out."
While they were talking, they saw a figure descending from the sky. Dressed in a gray robe with a solemn and dignified expression between his eyebrows, his face was full of sorrow. His sleeves were dotted with wet spots, and he looked weary.
"Father!"
"Family Head!"
The three siblings cried out in surprise.
The person was Li Xuanxuan, who had been stationed at the marketplace. As soon as he descended from the sky, the three younger ones quickly kneeled in respect. Li Xuanxuan waved his hand and took out a few fragments of jade from his sleeve, his voice deep with emotion and sorrow as he spoke.
"Xuanling... has passed away."
Li Xuanxuan's words struck the three like a thunderbolt. Li Yuanping and Li Yuanjiao turned pale, and Li Qinghong raised her head in shock, her face turning ashen. She stared at the piece of shattered jade in Li Xuanxuan's hand and could only stutter out a few words that were barely audible.
"Passed… away..?"
Her complexion became deathly pale as if drained of all blood. Li Xuanling was her father, and upon hearing this news, her heart shattered. She sank to the ground, covering her face and remaining silent.
