Silverfish and Master’s Awful Tea
* * *
And so began my days of training after becoming a disciple of Grandpa, or rather, my Master!
The season is early winter!
The vividly colored autumn leaves on the trees have completely withered to brown, turning into a blanket covering the ground.
<Emi, focus! You’re going to fall again!>
Yeah, got it, I’m okay, I’m okay.
Carefully lifting my right foot, taking a step forward, and then sticking it back…
So, here I am, walking on a wall.
I’m in the middle of training for 【Silverfish】.
Some might be surprised that I can walk on walls already!? But this is a world with magic!
Once you understand the principle, wall walking isn’t such an impossible feat!
<Well, even if you understand the principle, normal people don’t master it this quickly. Emi, you must have a talent or aptitude for magic manipulation techniques.>
Huff-huff! What’s that, Extra-sama? Compliments won’t get you anything~
<…That’s what happens when you get carried away…>
The next moment, my left foot, which was sticking to the wall and supporting my body, lost its adhesive force, and I fell to the floor. Ouch (cry).
<Didn’t I tell you to focus?>
Extra-sama sighs.
Yes, sorry…
This wall-walking technique, 【Silverfish】.
The most important part of performing this ninja-like technique is using magic to “stick” the soles of your feet to the wall.
On the night I was first taught 【Silverfish】 by Master,
my 【Magic Perception】 caught the flow of magic in Master’s soles as he walked on walls and ceilings, similar to 【Water Collection】 or 【Solidification】.
In other words, 【Silverfish】 was realized by repeatedly sticking and detaching one’s soles to and from the wall through magic manipulation!
<But as they say, easier said than done.>
Right.
It’s incredibly difficult.
Aside from the complexity of magic manipulation, defying gravity to “stand and walk” on walls demands significant physical control.
It’s not a skill one can acquire overnight.
But making the impossible possible brings immense joy.
It’s common to get so engrossed in training that before I know it, night falls.
<You must be really grateful to Master, who silently prepares meals, right?>
Yes, truly…
Master is taciturn, barely speaks, and always looks grumpy, but he’s genuinely kind.
Or rather, he’s quite indulgent towards me.
To not waste his kindness, I devote myself to training even today.
And before I know it, it’s time to sleep.
This was about a week after I started my training.
* * *
Time passed, and it became increasingly colder outside.
Master went hunting less frequently and spent more time doing handiwork inside.
Well, when I peeked before, there was a considerable amount of dried meat stored in the warehouse.
Seems like the preparations for winter were well in hand.
And me, huhu! I received a present from Master!
It’s the clothes I’m wearing now!
Though it was handed to me silently as usual without detailed explanation, I think it’s made from the fur of the Grim Reaper wolf that was chasing me on the day I met Master.
The black fur is rough and stiff but warm and cool!
Thank you, Master!
Wearing that black fur outfit, I am now crawling around the walls and ceiling of the room, rustling softly.
Yeah, I realized something.
It’s difficult because I was trying to stick to the wall on two legs.
But the name of this technique is 【Silverfish】, right?
Just like the original, I should use my whole body, increase the surface area, and stick to the wall!
<Original? Huh? Did I ever tell you about the great demon Silverfish, Emi?>
No, I don’t know anything about a great demon… I’ve never heard of such a thing… The only silverfish I know are those unpleasant pests from my previous life… They often played on the walls of rooms.
Anyway,
increasing the surface area to stick to the wall was the right approach, as it expanded the area for magic manipulation, making it easier to stick.
Furthermore, this posture made it easier to control my body.
Now, I can crawl on walls and ceilings at quite a speed!
So, I rustle around in the corner of the ceiling in Master’s field of view while he’s doing handiwork, showing off my newfound ability!
…Master glanced at me and shook his head.
Seems like it’s not okay unless I do it standing on two legs…
This was about two weeks after I started my training.
And now, the present!
It’s been about a month since I started my training.
As for my current situation, I’ve become quite adept at freely moving around on walls and ceilings—applause! Right now, I’m dozing off on the ceiling, taking a nap.
…Wow, the world of magic is truly amazing.
I never imagined that just a month of training could make such fantastical behaviors possible…!
<Emi, you say it so casually? This is probably quite difficult, you know? If it weren’t you, there are people who wouldn’t manage this even in a year.>
No, no, Extra-sama, that’s praising me too much, isn’t it?
But, well, to be honest, since I haven’t really interacted properly with anyone other than Master, I have no idea what the average person in this world is capable of, what kind of abilities they have…
But what’s clear is that, for example, if someone of Master’s level seriously tried to kill me, I wouldn’t be able to escape and would be dead within three seconds.
I’m still very weak.
Not to mention, Master hasn’t taught me 【Mantis】 or any other combat techniques yet…
<That person is exceptionally unusual. You can’t use him as a standard…>
Hmm? As Extra-sama and I chat, Master enters the room, holding two cups emitting warm steam.
It seems he’s made tea.
…Indeed, to my great honor, Master not only cooks but also brews tea for me.
That’s just too much!
Even if I’m a 6-year-old child and young, I can’t let Master do everything, including making tea!
I thought so and tried to do it myself, but Master adamantly refused to relinquish the tea-making duties.
Moreover, when I tried to open the shelf with the tea leaves on my own, I was fiercely intimidated.
I thought I was going to wet myself.
…Maybe he enjoys making tea?
But despite that, the tea Master brews is awful…
It’s so bitter, drinking it makes me feel nauseous.
Since I’m in no position to complain, I drink it silently.
Anyway, I can’t keep Master waiting, so I spin down from the ceiling to the floor.
And land perfectly!
Cool, right?
<At first, you failed and fell headfirst many times, though. Why add the extra spin?>
Why not!
I won’t get hurt because of 【Body Strengthening】!
This kind of acrobatics is my idea of romance!
Well, practicing such “unnecessary” movements? serves as a diversion during the monotonous days of training.
I walk up to Master, sit down across from him on the floor, and we drink tea together.
Yeah, Master’s tea is as bad as ever today.
But it doesn’t have a bad smell, so it’s better than a naked, tasteless mouse.
“…………Are you feeling okay?”
Unusually, Master speaks up.
Yeah, the tea is so bad that honestly, I don’t feel great, but I’ve gotten quite used to it compared to the beginning.
No problems here.
I nod in response.
We continue to drink tea in silence together.
Even though we have a fire burning inside, the house is old and drafty.
The warm tea soaks into my chilled body.
Noticing that I’ve emptied my cup, Master speaks again.
“…………【Silverfish】, you’ve done well.”
…Eh!? Sudden praise!? Thank you!?
“…………Next.”
Saying that, Master turns his back to me, still surprised by his sudden comment, and uses 【Silverfish】 to climb the wall and stand upside down on the ceiling.
Then, bending his knees, he propels himself toward the floor!
Wait, Master!?
Are you planning to dive headfirst into the floor!?
However, contrary to my worry, Master flips his body around and lands neatly on the floor.
It was truly splendid.
Despite descending with such momentum, not a single scratch appeared on the floor of the room that creaks with every step.
In fact.
There was no sound.
As if a feather had gently floated down.
Without generating any impact at all.
Master had landed on the floor.
“……If you can do this, you may start practicing 【Grasshopper】.”
With that, Master left the room again.
I stand dumbfounded by the sudden development.
From outside the hut, the sound of Master chopping wood echoes.
For now, it seems.
I’ve been given a new challenge.
