Upon hearing these words, a tumult arose from the seats below. The family heads displayed varied expressions, whispering among each other.
Li Tongya nodded slightly as well, finally understanding where the Yu Family's audacity stemmed from, and was left to ponder to himself.
With a family boasting two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, a disciple practicing in Yuanwu Peak, securing a unique jurisdiction to control the fate of the surrounding clans, and these coupled with the rebuilding of the market after the destruction of the Moongaze Lake Market to control the flow of goods, all advantages lie with the Yu Family! Should all plans succeed, the Yu Family indeed will solidify their dominance over the lake…
However, Yu Xiaogui, despite his ruthless actions, is overly impulsive and takes too many risks. Such a straightforward and forceful control over the other clans may backfire instead…
His gaze swept across the visibly upset head of the Fei Family opposite him. The middle-aged man was dressed in white, frowning as he held his cup. He caught Li Tongya's glance briefly.
Although the two were unaware of each other's names, having never met before, they found themselves aligned in interests in regards to the Yu Family's aggression.
The murmurs among the family heads ceased instantly, including those previously rallying behind the Yu Family—who fell silent almost immediately. Everyone understood the gravity of the situation; no one dared to speak up.
"What do you all think?" Yu Xiaogui sneered, anticipating the reaction of the family heads.
He was indifferent to the response of most clans, his attention fixed on a few whose disciples were cultivating within sects or who had strong backing. Seeing them all silent, with both the Li and Fei families not uttering a word, he pressed on, "Lu Sisi, what does your Lu Family think?"
Lu Sisi, momentarily stunned, wore a bitter smile on his aged face. Knowing full well of Yu Xiaogui's intentions yet fearing retaliation, he sighed, "If the Yu Family leads, of course it's for the best..."
His voice trailed off, and Yu Xiaogui, still with a cold expression, then declared loudly to the audience before him, "If there are no further objections, then the market matter is settled! I hope for your support when the time comes."
Li Tongya internally scoffed.
A trip to Lixia Prefecture is but a few hours away; what difference would it make to a Qi Cultivator? The Yu Family's market will only attract those at the Embryonic Breathing Realm and we won't be seeing substantial profits for the next few decades.
An air of unresolved tension hung over the family heads, powerless against the Yu Family's dominance.
As the atmosphere at the banquet grew colder, Li Tongya glanced down at the delicacies before him, cautiously refraining from partaking in the feasting.
Much to his surprise, a middle-aged man from the Yu Family stepped forward, cupping his fist, "I've heard of the Li Family Head's exceptional swordsmanship. I, too, practice the sword and would like to request your guidance."
Li Tongya sighed quietly, his spiritual sense briefly scanning the man to only discover that this man was at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
So it has come to this… they really do hold me in high regard.
Everyone's attention instantly focused on Li Tongya. Ever since the Qingsui Sword Immortal, Li Chejing, defeated Chi Zhiyun in Yi Mountain City with a single Celestial Moon Sword Intent, the reputation of the Li Family of Lijing had resounded across the lakeside prefectures. All the families were eager for someone to test the Li Family, and the Yu Family's probing aligned with everyone's wishes.
For a moment, the atmosphere at the banquet became lively, and even the head of the Fei Family looked up in interest for once.
Li Tongya, under the pressure of everyone's gaze, simply smiled. However, he showed no desire to take the spotlight, declining politely.
"I'm not sure where you heard such rumors… but I'm afraid I cannot oblige."
The mood cooled down immediately, and the middle-aged man from the Yu Family gritted his teeth when he heard his response.
"A swordsman should advance fearlessly! Yet, Brother Tongya shrinks back… is this the Li Family's attitude?" he spat rudely.
Yu Xiaogui gestured for him to stop, raising his cup with a smile, "I'd still ask for Brother Tongya to give our family this honor."
With the conversation having reached this point, Li Tongya had no choice but to stand up and move to the center of the boat.
He cupped his fist and introduced himself, "Li Tongya of the Li Family from Lijing."
"Yu Mujian of the Yu Family from Milin," Yu Mujian coldly introduced himself in return, drawing his sword and immediately launching an attack toward Li Tongya with a chilling sword glow.
Li Tongya, upon a brief scan with his spiritual sense, knew this man's swordsmanship posed no threat. However, he felt an inexplicable familiarity with the sword in the man's hand, prompting him to be more cautious.
Li Tongya drew his sword to block his attack, not going on the offensive but simply and skillfully deflecting each of Yu Mujian's sword aura and qi with almost no effort at all.
After over a dozen attacks, with Yu Mujian having exhausted most of his sword techniques without making Li Tongya so much as to shift his stance, his expression turned ugly.
The families above watched intently as Li Tongya stood still, effortlessly neutralizing Yu Mujian's aggressive assaults, earning a round of applause.
"Li Tongya's swordsmanship is far superior, Yu Mujian is no match at all!"
"As expected of a Sword Immortal Clan!" praised another.
Yu Mujian's face grew even darker, and Yu Xiaogui's smile slowly faded. He was observing coldly and was lost in his own thoughts.
Such sophisticated sword moves, and such a solid foundation in swordsmanship... The Li Family indeed has a swordsmanship legacy, starting from at least Grade Three!
"You!"
Yu Mujian glared at him, forming a hand seal with his left hand while his right hand held the sword which suddenly lit up with a hazy white glow, exuding Sharp Qi. Once again, he slashed toward Li Tongya aggressively.
"The Yu family's sword technique!" someone shouted from below.
Yu Mujian's face showed a hint of pride, his strikes slower but each with great momentum and force, pressing toward Li Tongya.
After several exchanges, boos filled the air as Li Tongya still stood unmoving in his spot with his sword in hand, effortlessly countering his attacks.
Even the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in the white brocade robe from the Fei Family snickered softly. This was an action that clearly irritated Yu Xiaogui.
"Is that all you can do, Li Tongya? Seems like that Qingsui Sword Immortal was just a nobody, and only good at defense!" Yu Mujian spat through gritted teeth. He was visibly flustered and recklessly cursing, causing an immediate shift in the atmosphere among the family heads seated above.
The white-robed Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from the Fei Family was almost bursting into laughter.
Yu Xiaogui's face changed drastically, and he hastily shouted, "Fool! Be quiet!"
Li Tongya's expression finally changed, a frown forming and a flash of anger in his eyes.
He repelled Yu Mujian's attack with a single sword strike, sheathed his sword, and then drew it again swiftly. A radiant arc of white sword light then burst forth, heading straight for Yu Mujian.
"Mercy, please!"
Just as the brilliant sword light rose, Yu Xiaogui had already stepped forward.
Caught off guard, Yu Mujian hastily parried with three strikes, but against the Celestial Moon Slash technique, his efforts shattered like paper. He stumbled backward, pale-faced and on the verge of being wounded when a pair of hands as white as jade caught the bright sword arc in front of him.
With a movement of Yu Xiaogui's left hand, he forcibly dissipated the sword arc into scattered Sharp Qi before pulling Yu Mujian aside and angrily demanding, "The Qingsui Sword Immortal is not someone you can insult at will! Apologize now!"
Yu Mujian sputtered a few words before finally gritting his teeth and biting down on his tongue.
"I was careless with my words and offended the esteemed Sword Immortal… Please forgive me," he apologized, albeit reluctantly.
Yu Xiaogui, both angry and anxious, now had to humbly apologize for his disciple's offense despite losing face and having to make amends now. Smiling outwardly but seething with rage internally, he said, "I failed to discipline him properly, leading to the offense against Senior Chejing from Lijing. Brother Tongya, please forgive us! Whatever punishment you deem fit for him, my Yu Family will accept."
While still maintaining a pleasant facade, Yu Xiaogui was furious.
One incapable son has nearly ruined me! Fortunately, Mujian is smarter, otherwise, the future of our Yu Family would be most uncertain...
Li Tongya smiled softly, picking up Yu Mujian's fallen sword from the ground and offering sage advice, "Cultivating the sword path doesn't solely depend on sharpness."
Seeing Yu Mujian's defiant look, Li Tongya earnestly added, "To advance sharply is to retreat swiftly. The essence of drawing blades lies in concealment. If you take my words to heart, your swordsmanship can advance further."
"Since the head of the Yu Family proposed a punishment, I'll keep this sword with me. Once you can control your Sharp Qi at will, come to Mount Lijing to retrieve your sword," he added.
Yu Mujian was visibly shaken by these words, but Yu Xiaogui nodded slightly, feeling relieved instead.
Li Tongya's remarks gracefully defused the situation, transforming a peer challenge into a junior's request for guidance, effectively saving the Yu Family from embarrassing themselves.
"Thank you, Senior," Yu Mujian murmured with a dazed look on his face.
The surrounding family heads whispered among themselves after witnessing, with one praising Li Tongya loudly.
"Senior Tongya is truly a gentleman!"
