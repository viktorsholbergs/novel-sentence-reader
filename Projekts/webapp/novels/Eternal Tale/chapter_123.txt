The night has already fallen. Looking around, countless stars are embedded in the dark blue night sky, dazzlingly beautiful.
The entire Yu Xu City is brightly lit, even busier than during the day, and the aura of the cultivators is completely different from that of ordinary people.
On the way back to Qin Immortal Mountain, Chen Xun was rummaging through the ingredients in his storage bag while telling stories to the big black ox.
When they saw a shop they liked, they would also go in to take a look. Everyone was reasonable, and no one kicked them out for just browsing without buying anything.
However, sometimes there would be cultivators bothering them on the road, saying something about an underground auction hosted by Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators, where many things not seen on the market could be found.
Chen Xun was quite decisive, saying he had no spirit stones. With his mountain-opening axe inadvertently revealed at his waist and his artifacts all being of low quality, there was no point in participating in the auction.
Countless words were stuck in the throat of the cultivator, and in the end, he could only leave dejectedly, looking for someone else.
With so many cultivators in the city, all sorts of people and things emerged. In the end, it was either an invitation to explore some secret realm together, followed by killing and looting, or some big shot appearing behind them, shocking countless cultivators. Playing such tricks with Chen Xun was outdated.
On the street, Chen Xun and the big black ox walked out of a refining shop, looking content, without buying anything.
"Old ox, let's go home and cook." Chen Xun, as if having seen enough, held the head of the big black ox in one hand. "I already understand the 108 cooking methods of the Red Electric Wolf."
"Moo?!" The big black ox nudged the man, its eyes widening considerably.
"Hehe, Old Ox, don't underestimate me..." Chen Xun revealed a deep mysterious smile. "The Crane Spirit Tree can also be used as a seasoning. Its characteristics are not something an ordinary spirit tree possesses."
"Moo!"
"Let's go."
They ran all the way, if someone knew that a Golden Core Stage cultivator behaved like this, they would probably be astonished.
The Golden Core Stage cultivators in this city were all frequent visitors to elegant and noble places, truly 'conversing with scholars and having no dealings with commoners'.
Back at the Qin Immortal Mountain, in their cave, Chen Xun rolled up his sleeves, holding the mountain-opening axe in his hand, and the pots and pans were also brought out.
They occasionally polished these old companions and added some refining materials without any signs of decay.
On a smooth and flat giant stone, the Red Electric Wolf was placed, and Chen Xun and the big black ox had already finished the pre-dinner rituals.
Chen Xun would sometimes enter the cave to fetch something, and sometimes spread the meat around. The big black ox followed closely, wherever Chen Xun went, it went.
"Old ox, set up the fire! Set up the fire!"
"Moo!"
Outside the cave, the manâ€™s wild laughter echoed, the fragrance of the meat filled the air, and various seasonings were ready. He even ground a section of the Crane Spirit Tree branch into powder.
The big black ox was a bit impatient, and when its body swayed, it blew away many seasonings onto the ground. Chen Xun slapped its head and scolded it.
Not everyone can achieve great success. Chen Xun and the big black ox, as immortals like them, were destined to seek the meaning of life in the trivialities of daily cultivation.
They didn't go to the various auctions anymore, staying home every day, spending most of their time cultivating.
...
The past is like smoke, scattered by the wind and dust. Inadvertently, another year has passed.
The centennial grand event of the Qian Nation will officially begin in a month. The entire Yu Xu City is crowded with people, with flying boats constantly passing by outside the city, giant ships crossing the sky, and various flying spirit beasts coming through the air.
Countless disciples of various sects are also coming towards the city under the leadership of their elders, crowding the central city area. Many geniuses have already begun their intellectual battles.
The Xianyue Tower has released a major announcement this year: Ren Wei, the Fairy, has officially emerged from seclusion, becoming the contemporary number one figure of the Xianyue Tower, a possessor of celestial spiritual roots!
In less than two hundred years, she has reached the Golden Core Stage, and her future is limitless. If she doesn't die prematurely, in a few hundred years, the Xianyue Tower will have a new transcendent figure.
Rumors abound in the streets that this woman is not only extraordinarily beautiful but also possesses an unmatched temperament, causing countless male cultivators to return to the mundane world from their secluded lives...
Apart from the Purple Cloud Sect, the outstanding disciples of various major sects bear their respective responsibilities from their masters. If one can win over this woman, they can save themselves from struggling for hundreds of years!
Naturally, the Purple Cloud Sect is not willing to be outdone. Mu Qing has announced her emergence from seclusion, also becoming the contemporary number one figure of the Purple Cloud Sect, a possessor of celestial spiritual roots.
It will surely be a scene of fierce competition and dazzling displays, with countless cultivators paying more attention to it than to the battles of the geniuses!
However, the contemporary number ones of the other nine major sects are utterly disdainful. They are directly preparing to set up a stage in the central city area, with graceful postures and strong momentum in their eyes.
The contemporary number one of the Qingyang Gate, Kong Yongyuan, even issued a tough statement: "I hope the geniuses of various countries can make me interested..."
Countless female cultivators were captivated. Such a towering man may perhaps be the best choice for a Daoist partner.
But amidst the hustle and bustle outside, two figures were walking towards the countless cultivators entering the city.
As the sun sets in the west, a chill sets in, seemingly adding a touch of sadness to the inevitable conclusion of someone's life.
They are pushing a wooden coffin, calmly walking towards the city gate, attracting curious glances from countless cultivators.
Li Miao has passed away, unable to hold on until the eve of the grand event, falling on the bed of his little hut.
When Chen Xun and the big black ox passed by the north gate, they wanted to visit Li Miao, but he had been dead for three days. Everything on him had already been plundered, leaving only his slightly yellowed white clothes.
How did he die? There are various rumors among the surrounding cultivators. Some say he died of old age, some say he was robbed of a lot of spirit stones and died of anger.
Li Miao had few friends, living humbly every day, just hoping to live long enough to participate in the centennial event and buy a cave.
But obviously, he knew his time was short. Perhaps he didn't have enough spirit stones to buy the Foundation Establishment Pill and went to the Heart Refining Pavilion three or four times to plead.
Chen Xun also knew about his condition. Meeting is fate, so he prepared a bottle of nourishing pills for him, at least allowing him to hold on until the end of the event without leaving so many regrets.
But things are unpredictable. Even cultivators cannot predict the fate of insignificant people. They were still a step too late.
The withered branches outside Li Miao's door had been trampled by many people, scattered by the cold wind. It seems that many people have come before...
Outside the city, it is still bustling, the sun is setting in the west, and countless cultivators are walking together, laughter echoing.
Chen Xun and the big black ox buried the coffin in the Tian Duan Great Plain, outside the Qian Nation. The surrounding scenery is desolate and difficult to traverse. Perhaps this way, no one will disturb his eternal rest.
Chen Xun didn't hold a ceremony, but played the suona, while the big black ox shook the bell beside him. In this desolate place, it seems to be the final resting place for those who strive but are unwilling to be ordinary.
Chen Xun seemed to be burying Li Miao, but also burying himself. They are, ultimately, ordinary.
There is no pity or regret in their eyes, as if all emotions have disappeared. They sit silently in front of the lonely grave.
"Friend, have a safe journey. I won't send you far."
"Moo~"
The yellow sand blankets their figures. In the vast expanse of gray, brown, their bodies turn into streams of light and disappear in the blink of an eye.
This year, they continue to focus on enhancing their defenses.
