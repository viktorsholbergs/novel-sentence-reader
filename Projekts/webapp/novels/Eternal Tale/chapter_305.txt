"That place is known as… the Three Thousand Great Worlds, said to be vast and boundless, stretching beyond imagination, where countless races thrive."
"It is rumored that cultivation resources are endless, with fierce battles over the Dao, and even celestial physiques and existences surpassing heavenly spiritual roots!"
"That world can truly be called a civilization of cultivation. No matter how vast our domain may seem, in comparison, it is but a drop in the ocean, utterly insignificant."
It turned out that their domain was merely an affiliated world born from the Three Thousand Great Worlds, positioned at the very edge of the grand cosmos. However, in the beginning, the two realms were directly connected.
Back then, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was abundant, giving rise to numerous ancient cultivators of immense power—beings at the Refining Ruins stage.
These cultivators, unbound by attachment, left their realm without hesitation, seeking immortality in the greater world, never looking back.
However, one day, a cultivator returned in shock, revealing the truth about their affiliated world.
The source of the Three Thousand Great Worlds strongly repelled small worlds like theirs. These minor worlds were akin to tumors, siphoning the great world's essence to strengthen themselves.
But the great world had long stabilized, with established laws governing its existence. It was no longer the primordial era of creation, and it had no need for additional realms to merge with it.
Every day, new small worlds were born and destroyed within it. Their domain was nothing special, and neither were its inhabitants.
Originally, their world had been directly connected to the great world’s outskirts, but as the great world's essence rejected it, a deep barrier formed at the edges of their domain, closing inch by inch every day.
Once fully sealed, their small world would be cast adrift, wandering the vast cosmos, its coordinates lost, left to its own fate—never to find the way back.
By that time, those capable of escaping had already fled, but many powerful cultivators chose to stay behind.
This was their homeland. They had to carve a path for future generations. The domain could not be sealed, and the road could not be severed.
Yet, no one anticipated what would come next.
As the domain sealed shut, the negative energies of the world coalesced at its farthest edge.
Like a manifestation of the great world's rejection and loathing, the corrupted beasts—creatures that defied life itself—were born. This was a natural occurrence dictated by the world's laws, abrupt and unforeseen, catching everyone unprepared.
To this day, no one can fully explain the origins of the corrupted beasts, nor does anyone have the power to investigate.
The laws of the world follow the cycle of creation and destruction. All things are subject to balance—some domains might struggle free, while others are destined to be annihilated.
Such occurrences were common in the great world. There were too many of them. No one cared about the fate of these minor realms, nor did they think highly of this tiny, insignificant land at the cosmic edge.
Each day, more people perished in the Three Thousand Great Worlds than the entire population of a small domain. A single borderland held no significance amid such vastness.
When the domain was finally sealed shut, the corrupted beasts, as if having absorbed the essence of the great world itself, became incomprehensibly powerful. Thus, the ancient war erupted.
All beings of the domain were forced into battle, facing extinction itself. Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation cultivators from the Ancient Era of the Qian Nation hurried to the frontlines at the domain’s edge.
The mightiest of the corrupted beasts were eventually slain, but the great cultivators who remained behind also exhausted their lifespans. Both sides suffered heavy losses.
With the depletion of heavenly resources, each successive generation grew weaker, and countless legacies were lost.
The road… was ultimately severed. They had fallen onto the path trodden by countless small worlds before them, bound to face destruction someday—forgotten and uncared for.
Yet, the ancient forces that bore the name of antiquity had origins far beyond this realm.
They had all come from the Three Thousand Great Worlds, establishing themselves here.
And yet, their actions were peculiar. Since arriving in the ancient past, they had shown no desire to leave—as if they intended to perish alongside this world.
The native beings of this land dared not force these powerful outsiders to take up arms. Instead, they subtly influenced them to join the battle.
At this point, Baili Zhong Hu paused. Too much had been lost from the ancient past—there was no way to verify it anymore.
"Daoist Chen, this is the truth of the domain, passed down from one Commander to the next."
He fixed his gaze on Chen Xun, whose mouth had fallen open in shock. "That is why the truth—that there is no path forward—must never be revealed. Otherwise..."
He hesitated, unwilling to threaten him. A cultivator who had reached the Divine Transformation stage should understand the gravity of this matter.
"Commander, the Three... Three... The Three Thousand Great Worlds?!"
Chen Xun shot to his feet, hands pressing against the wooden table, his face flushed with excitement, his voice trembling. Then, all of a sudden, he roared, "We have to find a way there!!!"
Senior Brother Ji’s ancient texts never explained things in such detail. They only mentioned a grand super-world, but who could have imagined it was that vast?!
The more Chen Xun thought about it, the more thrilled he became. A super Three Thousand Great Worlds—holy crap! Investment! Mad investment! Invest in all races!!
For the immortals, they had to be the ones pulling the strings behind this great era!
"Moo! Moo! Moo!!!"
The big black ox was just as fired up, slamming a hoof onto Chen Xun's shoulder, its breathing rough and erratic as it stared intently at the Commander.
Little Red was utterly dumbfounded. No matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t comprehend how their vast domain was nothing more than a speck in the grand scheme of the Three Thousand Great Worlds. Impossible! Even the Tian Duan Plains were massive!
"Daoist friend..."
Baili Zhong Hu fell silent. This man’s train of thought was simply too erratic. That wasn’t what he was trying to say. "The truth is, there is no path forward—"
"Bullshit!" Chen Xun cut him off. "Commander, there is absolutely a path forward! Old Ox, Little Red, don’t you agree?!"
"Moo! Moo!!"
"Brother Xun, honestly, I think there’s a way too!"
"Hahahaha..."
Chen Xun burst into laughter, throwing an arm around the big black ox while pulling Little Red close. The three of them stared unblinkingly at Baili Zhong Hu, making the latter feel a little uneasy.
Baili Zhong Hu’s expression darkened. He hadn’t expected this man to be so utterly unreliable—he had misjudged him. So much wasted effort.
The mountain peak fell into silence once more. Chen Xun and his companions were still immersed in their excitement.
With a cold snort, Baili Zhong Hu decided this had been a wasted trip. Just as he was about to rise and leave, a steady voice called out to him:
"Commander, I have a grand plan—and I need your help."
"Daoist friend, speak freely."
"This matter… I ask that you keep it quiet. We are only doing this for ourselves; your survival has nothing to do with us."
Chen Xun's gaze lost its excitement, growing dark and unfathomable. His aura turned cold and severe. "Those late-stage Divine Transformation corrupted beasts... leave them to us."
"What?! You—"
"Commander, listen to me first..."
Chen Xun pulled out a small booklet and began explaining the plan he had written.
Baili Zhong Hu’s composed expression gradually shifted to one of deep seriousness. Then it turned to shock. Finally, his face changed drastically, his eyes filled with utter disbelief!
Outside the mountain of corpses, on the ten warships anchored in the skies, the soldiers of the Battle Realm Camp saw their Commander's reaction and immediately grew alert.
The entire area had been sealed off—no sound could escape. They had no idea what their Commander had just heard, but it was enough to shake this peerless warlord to his core.
The sky remained dim, and within a radius of several hundred miles, not a single corrupted beast dared to approach. An eerie silence filled the land.
