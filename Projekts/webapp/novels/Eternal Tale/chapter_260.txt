On the desolate island, the bleak sea breeze howled, weaving a constant melody of darkness and solitude.
At the island's center, the big black ox and Little Red were tinkering with a medium-sized teleportation array, their low growls and "mooing" seamlessly exchanging in their beastly language.
Chen Xun sat cross-legged by the coastline. Though the island and the sky were void of life, the forbidden sea still teemed with strange marine creatures, the most peculiar of which dwelled in its furthest reaches.
Boom!
The sea surface exploded, and black waves surged toward Chen Xun. A faint glow emanated from him as a five-colored shield appeared, sizzling as the black sea water struck it.
In his hand wriggled a large fish at the Foundation Establishment stage. Its species was unidentifiable, but its maw was brimmed with sharp fangs, and its blood-red eyes glared menacingly at Chen Xun.
The fish opened its gaping maw, showing no fear even in the presence of a Nascent Soul cultivator. It had lost all reason, driven solely by primal savagery.
Chen Xun lightly pointed a finger, and the fish's pupils dulled. Its body withered, leaving behind a dark, murky essence of blood suspended in front of him.
“This…” Chen Xun frowned. “It’s even stranger than the blood of demonic cultivators. It doesn’t feel like the blood of a living creature.”
He observed closely. The blood was devoid of essence, as though the heavens themselves rejected it. Vital essence is a natural component of life, intrinsic to all creatures.
This Foundation Establishment fish had its essence buried deep within its bloodline, making it impossible to expel.
Chen Xun had recently begun to understand the intricacies of vital essence, enabling him to perceive things other cultivators couldn’t. Without this insight, he might’ve slain such forbidden sea beasts without noticing anything unusual.
Even if poured into a rootless essence flower, this blood would elicit no reaction—it was utterly worthless.
“Incredible. Could the other side of the sea be home to an enemy?” Chen Xun gazed at the ancient formation in the distance. “Foul longevity… a concept of corrupted life, perhaps? ‘Longevity,’ not ‘beast.’ It might not even be a living creature.”
Longevity is like a blade that casts its shadow over all things. No matter how invincible or transcendent, it subtly influences the heart and drives one forward—especially cultivators, whose unyielding ambition far surpasses that of ordinary beings.
Yet such a creature, which defied the natural order of life, was a true abomination.
“It’s all just speculation for now. If this really represents foul longevity, it would be meaningless. I need more information.” Chen Xun shook his head gently, unwilling to believe cultivators could be so foolish. “Eventually, I’ll need to return to The Great Li Realm and cross the sea with those other cultivators to witness the ‘inverted Heavenly Gate.’”
Taking out a small notebook, he began outlining his next steps, muttering softly, “I wonder if that monk has broken through yet. A dual-Golden Core talent… truly extraordinary.”
Chen Xun’s eyes gleamed with admiration. Regardless of elemental alignment, he had never heard of anyone cultivating an additional Golden Core.
The monk’s second core was particularly unusual, seeming entirely unlike something cultivated postnatally.
Though Chen Xun had once cultivated five Golden Cores, the monk’s second core felt fundamentally different. At the time, he dared not investigate too deeply—such things were surely a private secret. He was only caught off guard by the phrase “Path to Ascension,” which had briefly shaken his composure.
A Golden Core reflects one’s cultivation stage, yet Chen Xun refused to believe it could be read so easily.
Especially given that he and his companions followed the Five Elements Path, a path that should make their cultivation utterly inscrutable. The monk, it seemed, concealed countless secrets.
“A Golden Core at the early stage… Monk, you’re hiding quite a bit. Let’s see if you can overcome your inner demons.” Chen Xun chuckled, finding it amusing. “This is the first time we’ve befriended such a prodigy on this journey. Don’t let it end prematurely.”
His expression turned tranquil as he began calculating the days left before leaving Qian Nation. One by one, potential plans and contingencies filled his notebook.
…
Half a month later.
A bellowing roar and a lion’s growl echoed from the island as the medium-sized teleportation array was completed.
Chen Xun, still meditating by the shore, was drawn back from his thoughts by the sound.
“Finished already?”
“Moo!!”
“Brother Xun, all set!”
The big black ox trotted over, with Little Red perched on its back, waving its claws excitedly. The plentiful “God-killing Stones” had made the array exceptionally stable, and even the forbidden sea couldn’t block the Five Elements Qi.
Chen Xun stood and smiled, a hint of profundity in his eyes that went unnoticed by the others.
The big black ox reached Chen Xun, nudging him fiercely. Only it could operate the teleportation array linked to the Five Elements Array Flags, which contained secrets beyond comprehension.
Even Chen Xun couldn’t control the array—the intricate pathways were encoded within the flags, far beyond what the Five Elements Qi alone could manage.
“Let’s go. Time to leave the Forbidden Sea.” Chen Xun glanced at the massive boat. “Little Crane, prepare to mask your life force.”
A soft rustling ensued as the Crane Spirit Five Elements Tree swayed. Its black-and-white leaves dimmed until all traces of life force vanished, as though it had concealed its very existence.
“Brother Crane is amazing,” Little Red said enviously, stretching its head forward. “If I could mask my life force like that, I’d be a master of playing dead. No one would ever find me!”
Smack!
Chen Xun slapped it hard, sending Little Red spiraling through the air with a wail, spinning a full 720 degrees.
“Moo!” The big black ox bellowed, charging into the sky to deliver a flying headbutt.
“Ahhh!” Little Red’s screams intensified, spinning even faster in midair.
"Transform its life force? What nonsense! Your Brother Crane is alive and has never pretended otherwise. Little Red, do you even think before you speak?" Chen Xun scolded sharply, pointing at Little Red. "It’s one of us, a brother. Don’t say things that sow discord."
"Moo moo!" The big black ox snorted angrily, exhaling a gust of air at Little Red.
They had only concealed Brother Crane’s life force for the convenience of the teleportation array. Now that it had developed sentience, it was absolutely not meant to be treated like some spirit beast in a pouch.
Humbled, Little Red whimpered and slumped onto the black ox’s back, not daring to utter another word. Yet deep down, it felt moved.
Brother Xun had never treated them like mere spirit beasts or tools of assistance; he regarded them as kin, bound by different bloodlines yet united as family.
Even the mighty Ox Brother followed him with unwavering loyalty, a testament to Xun’s unmatched charisma. Truly, few beings could compare.
"I was wrong, Brother Xun, Brother Ox, Brother Crane," Little Red apologized with an ingratiating grin, bowing its head excessively low. "From now on, I’ll think before I speak."
"See that it doesn’t happen again. Now, let’s move out, brothers!" Chen Xun stepped forward, the power of the Five Elements coiling around the boat.
A deep rumble echoed as the vessel began to vibrate. Together, they ascended into the air, heading toward the teleportation array at the island’s center.
