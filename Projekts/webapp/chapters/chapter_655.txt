Perplexed but obedient, Li Zhouwei lowered his head. As he kneeled, the voices of Li Xuanxuan and Li Qinghong echoed in unison—one hoarse and weathered, the other resonant and firm—reverberating throughout the chamber, "The Li Family of Qingdu offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion. We respectfully request the talisman for our descendant. He will dedicate his life to pursuing the Dao and his destiny rests in your hands… When the time comes, he will remain true to their oath. With this talisman burned, we express our gratitude to Supreme Yin."
Their voices reverberated in the chamber, causing a slight tremor in the air. Li Zhouwei widened his eyes in shock at the power of the words. Before he could grasp their full meaning, he looked up and saw a brilliant white light emanating from the stone platform.
The light grew increasingly intense, as if something were struggling to emerge from the void within. Its radiance was dazzling and interspersed with faint traces of an abyssal darkness.
He stared blankly for a moment, as a faint scent of osmanthus wafted to his nose. Li Xuanxuan and Li Qinghong exchanged glances, just beginning to show hints of joy, when a muffled groan escaped from Li Zhouwei beside them.
"Ugh..." He abruptly covered his eyes, trembling tears streaming down from the corners. His muffled groans of pain echoed in the quiet chamber.
Li Qinghong's sharp instincts kicked in as she immediately realized, This child's eyes are unlike ordinary people! To directly gaze upon such an immortal object, he is naturally affected!
Without hesitation, she patted his back gently and spoke in a soothing tone, "Calm your mind and focus. Recall the incantation, and guide the talisman seed."
Li Zhouwei felt a light tremor in his sea of qi, and a white radiance emerged from within—a small, radiant white orb. Quickly, he sat cross-legged and began chanting the mantra, carefully guiding the talisman seed.
Li Xuanxuan exhaled a sigh of relief. He and Li Qinghong stepped out of the chamber, smiles spreading across their faces. In a low voice, he said, "Although we suspected this child would accept the talisman seed, seeing it truly take hold is a great relief."
"It was not easy." Li Qinghong remarked, "How long has it been since someone in the family received a talisman? Ximing barely has two offspring, and who knows if they even have spiritual orifices. Xijun insists on being solitary... No one among Cheng and Ming generation was favored by fortune..."
"Thankfully, we have Zhouwei..." Li Xuanxuan sighed deeply, his spirits visibly lifted. Just as Li Qinghong was about to reply, her expression shifted, a mix of surprise and delight lighting up her face as she turned toward the northern mountain range.
Though not at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Xuanxuan immediately noticed her gaze and followed it. In the distance, faint traces of drifting snow and roaring northern winds became visible. He broke into a broad smile and exclaimed, "It is Yuting Peak!"
The summit of Yuting Peak was blanketed in pristine snow, with gusts of pine-laden wind sweeping across it. Li Qinghong stepped onto a streak of lightning and soared ahead. As she neared the mountain, she saw that the snowfall was relentless despite the otherwise cloudless skies. Snow poured steadily over the mountain, blanketing everything in sight.
At the same time, the northern wind raged, shaking every pine tree on the mountain and sending waves of snow cascading down. From the peak rose a pure white streak of light, carrying with it the frigid chill of pine and snow. It was a figure clad in white robes, a sword slung across his back.
"Aunt!" Li Xijun appeared even younger than he had before his seclusion. Effortlessly stepping across the snow, his spirit sword Hanlin hummed joyfully behind him, reflecting the excitement in his sharp, lifted brows.
"Good lad." Li Qinghong pursed her lips into a smile without speaking, while Li Xuanxuan burst into hearty laughter as he hurried to greet him. Of all the children in the Xi and Yue generation, Li Xijun had always been the closest to him. His joy at the reunion was heartfelt as he clasped the young man's hands, his grin stretching ear to ear.
Li Xijun, exuding an ethereal chill that set him apart, smoothed his white robes and said,
"I did not disappoint the elders' expectations. I have established my Dao Foundation, Snow on Pine. It enables me to tread upon snow, command frigid winds, amplify my sword light, enhance spell power, extend longevity, and mitigate injuries..."
As they walked downhill, he elaborated politely on the nature of his Immortal Foundation, "With this foundation, I can tread upon snow and harness cold winds, a potent advantage against Qi Cultivators. It can dispel opposing wind-based spells and enhance both techniques and sword light with frost and gusts, making it an immortal foundation well-suited for combat."
"Not only does this immortal foundation extend longevity and reduce injury impact, it also enables one to endure longer in environments where spiritual energy is scarce..." After listing the core benefits, he demonstrated several new techniques derived from his Immortal Foundation. Then, pinching his fingers into a hand seal, he added, "The Slaughter Jun Kui Light has also evolved considerably, now stronger by nearly thirty percent. I now see the wisdom of cultivating spells before establishing one's foundation."
He pondered for a moment and said, "Perhaps it is due to its influence. Now, whenever I use this spell, it naturally connects to the Immortal Foundation within me, complementing each other and greatly enhancing its power."
Li Xuanxuan listened with a smile, his expression showing his good mood. Li Xijun, however, appeared slightly puzzled and said in a low voice, "But while I was in seclusion earlier, the spiritual energy and earth veins around me fluctuated unpredictably, brightening and dimming without warning… it was truly dangerous. If not for the support of that Essence Gathering Pill, I might have been completely thrown off balance."
"...Such a mess!" Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say. Finally, he spoke softly, "You are fortunate… as for Guiluan… she has already entered spiritual dissolution. Your sister buried her spirit husk alongside Yuanjiao, as a couple's burial."
Li Xijun's face turned pale. He seemed to have anticipated this outcome and said softly, "Second Uncle sought her out before. Aunt is among the wisest of people—she must have already guessed that he would not return. Her attempt to break through in seclusion was done with the resolve to die; she was not aiming for survival."
Li Xuanxuan fell silent again, his gaze drifting toward the ancestral hall on the mountain. Thinking of Li Zhouwei, he softly said, "This is a long story. We can discuss it further later… Zhouwei is in the ancestral hall. We should go check on him first!"
The three of them were standing outside the formation and couldn't discuss matters of receiving the talisman openly. Li Xijun, being someone who understood implied meanings, needed no further explanation. Hearing only the mention of Zhouwei being in the ancestral hall, he already understood the situation. He nodded gently and said, "Indeed, this is not the place for such discussions. Let us enter the mountain before speaking further."
The three entered the ancestral hall, only to find Li Zhouwei already standing silently within the chamber. He raised his pair of dark golden eyes and stared blankly at the stone platform, as though sensing something.
"How fast!" Li Xuanxuan, who had witnessed many generations of talisman acceptance in his family, couldn't help but be astonished. In the past, not one of them had completed the process in less than a few hours—some had even taken an entire day, starting in the morning and finishing at night.
But this time, in the span of less than a single stick of incense, Li Zhouwei had already completed the process. He now stood there thoughtfully, waiting. The old man sighed inwardly and hurried forward to ask, "Zhouwei, did you receive any techniques or spells?!"
The boy raised his head slightly, his gold-and-white robe fluttering gently in the breeze. He replied, "I received a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation method."
His words exploded like thunder in their ears, leaving the three momentarily stunned. Li Xuanxuan's face flushed, and he murmured in disbelief, "What?!"
Li Zhouwei nodded slightly, his dark golden eyes blinking as he calmly and clearly enunciated, "A Grade Five Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique—Radiant Essence Scripture."
