Chapter 45: Don’t Underestimate the Dough Stick as a Weapon
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Lu Yang, holding a sword in one hand, grabbed Qi Wu by the neck with the other and threw him backward: “There’s a door behind, run for it!”
In the blink of an eye, Qi Wu was thrown three or four meters away. Just as he was about to hit the ground, an invisible force lifted his body, allowing him to land steadily.
“Thank you, immortal, for saving me!”
He immediately ran outside with Ah Yue and the others without any hesitation.
They couldn’t ascertain the cultivation levels of Lu Yang and the tiger demon. They only knew that in a cultivator’s battle, regardless of the outcome, it would affect the surroundings. With their mortal bodies, getting involved could mean spending the rest of their lives either bedridden or buried.
The tiger demon’s fur stood on end, and the “king” character on its forehead glowed slightly, aiming to tear Lu Yang apart with even more ferocity.
“I’ll help you!”
The other two mountain god statues made noise. One held a book, looking scholarly, while the other radiated light, resembling a high monk with an indestructible golden body!
Barbarian Bone felt his book was too light. He put it away and pulled out two copies of the “Great Xia Dictionary” from his bosom.
“Feels right.”
Barbarian Bone had been taught from a young age that the barbarian race was a warrior race, not limited to the form of their weapons. Anything could be your weapon; use whatever is handy.
Now, the handiest thing was a book.
“Knowledge is power!”
Holding two dictionaries like bricks, he smacked them against the tiger demon’s forehead, leaving the demon stunned, having never seen such a weapon.
Meng Jingzhou didn’t need any weapon. His body was his strongest weapon. He transformed into a golden figure, charging at the tiger demon. The ghost behind the tiger demon screamed, beginning to smoke.
Pure Yang spiritual root was especially effective against ghosts!
The ghost, terrified, no longer obeyed the tiger demon’s commands, fleeing the temple and disappearing into the rain.
The tiger demon had never been as angry as it was today.
It didn’t want to conflict with cultivators, but that didn’t mean it was afraid of them. It could easily tear these naïve youngsters to pieces and escape elsewhere, wondering who could find it.
What a pity to leave such a feng shui treasure like Song Mountain.
Thinking thus, the tiger demon didn’t hold back. Its tail swept towards Lu Yang with a howling sound, and if Lu Yang continued his attack, he would undoubtedly be seriously injured!
Lu Yang made a split-second decision, withdrawing his sword and retreating as the tiger’s tail smashed into the ground, shaking the entire temple.
The three had grave expressions: “It has already condensed a Golden Core phantom!”
To form a Golden Core, one first needs to condense a phantom of the Golden Core. The core transforms from phantom to reality, officially entering the Golden Core stage.
The tiger demon in front of them was clearly in the process of forming its Golden Core, its strength extraordinary!
“I am a half-step Golden Core stage powerhouse, and you, mere Foundation Establishment youngsters, dare to harm me!”
“Half-step Golden Core?” Lu Yang looked at Meng Jingzhou, having never heard this term from the eldest sister.
The layman Meng Jingzhou explained: “It means not yet having formed a Golden Core but always thinking highly of oneself, not comparable to Foundation Establishment, but trying to bump up to Golden Core stage. Golden Core cultivators don’t even take them seriously, quite pitiful.”
The kind-hearted Barbarian Bone added: “It’s normal for Brother Lu not to know. Our sect elders disdain this term. Forming a Golden Core doesn’t need transitioning from phantom to reality; vulgar people do that. They directly form the core.”
The honest Lu Yang pitied the tiger demon: “Indeed pitiful.”
The tiger demon grew even angrier, its eyes bloodshot. Its proud cultivation was belittled to nothing by these three youngsters.
And the worst part was that they genuinely believed it!
The tiger demon released its pressure, trying to suppress the three.
Unexpectedly, none of them were affected. Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou even scoffed: “We’ve endured the pressure of a Nascent Soul stage great demon with ancient dragon blood. How could we be affected by you?”
Barbarian Bone, with his ancient barbarian blood, feared no pressure. The barbarians were domineering in ancient times because they feared nothing.
Highlighting their barbarism.
The tiger demon gave up imitating the human stance of standing on two legs, lowering its front limbs to the ground, its chin close to the ground, and its tiger eyes fixedly waiting for the three.
Boom—
The tiger demon’s hind legs pushed off forcefully, like a cannonball, smashing hard towards the three. With the Green Edge Sword in front, Lu Yang barely blocked the tiger demon’s claws.
Lu Yang spun and retreated, dissipating the tiger demon’s force.
Unlike the previous Painted Skin ghost, whose advantage lay in strangeness and wasn’t adept at attack, making it easy to defeat once its identity was revealed, the tiger demon was different.
Demons are known for their physical bodies. It’s not to say the tiger demon’s cultivation was almost a whole level above the three; it was remarkable that Lu Yang could block the attack without injury.
Meng Jingzhou and Barbarian Bone, one on each side, attacked from both sides. The tiger demon’s blood runes flickered, transforming into a gust of wind, flying above them and striking down hard.
Clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger; tiger demons naturally control wind spells, an innate spell from their bloodline!
Meng Jingzhou, unable to leverage in the air, met the tiger demon’s palm. Barbarian Bone protected his chest with the dictionary, half of it shredded by the tiger demon’s claw.
Lu Yang seized the opportunity to thrust his sword forward relentlessly, the blade striking like lightning, instantly reaching the tiger demon. He stabbed several times, but the tiger demon’s thick fur made it impossible for Lu Yang’s sword to penetrate.
Just as the tiger demon was about to laugh at Lu Yang’s overestimation, several bursts of sword energy exploded within it where Lu Yang had struck, causing it to bleed profusely.
Hidden sword energy!
Lu Yang didn’t need to pierce through; his aim was to inject sword energy into the opponent!
This is where demons fall short compared to physical cultivators; their external bodies are formidable, but their internal organs and blood are extremely fragile!
The tiger demon retreated, unwilling to clash directly with Lu Yang’s sword any longer.
Unexpectedly, Lu Yang was relentless. The tiger demon dodged his right-handed sword strike, but Lu Yang’s left hand brought out a dough stick, striking the tiger demon’s head with it!
The tiger demon could have dodged, but seeing the dough stick, it let its guard down, chuckling at Lu Yang’s childishness, using anything at hand in desperation.
Then it was stunned.
What kind of dough stick was this?
Meng Jingzhou transformed into a mountain, seizing the few seconds the tiger demon was dazed to ram into its waist. The tiger demon appeared cunning and experienced, but it was full of flaws.
It adhered to a non-fighting principle, preferring to run than fight, having barely engaged in combat throughout its cultivation.
The tiger demon staggered from the impact. Barbarian Bone struck, aiming for the eyes. The tiger demon hurriedly turned its head, getting hit on the cheek instead, losing a patch of fur.
The tiger demon instinctively swung its tail, hitting Barbarian Bone, who deftly dodged, barely injured.
Lu Yang thrust several times with his sword, supplementing with a few hits from the dough stick, forcing the tiger demon to retreat continuously.
After the exchange, the three gained the upper hand.
The tiger demon realized, despite their young age and lower cultivation, they displayed profound foundations, surely backed by a powerful force, and began to think of retreating.
The three were not about to let the tiger demon escape. Releasing it today meant untold harm tomorrow.
It couldn’t be allowed to flee!
“Don’t push me too far!”
The tiger demon roared, furious beyond measure. The three sensed the tiger demon’s desperation and braced themselves.
The tiger demon’s eyes bulged, roaring towards the temple entrance, using its last resort: “Wife, they’re trying to kill me!”
