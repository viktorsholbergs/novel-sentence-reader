Roar!
A flash of sword light flickered underwater, suddenly creating a burst of blood as it left a massive wound at the serpent's vulnerable point.
Kong Tingyun was momentarily stunned, then sighed and she marveled to herself, "What a brilliant sword technique…"
The black serpent dragon coiled upward, entangling itself with the Hooked Serpent. The serpent no longer had time to hate its opponent's treachery as Kong Tingyun's spells and Li Yuanjiao's sword qi continued to rain down on it, battering it repeatedly.
The Hooked Serpent, unsure of what immortal foundation the attack stemmed from, spat out two green beams of light. The two venomous hooks on its forked tail also sprang up right away.
Kong Tingyun laughed lightly and chirped, "I have been waiting for this!"
From her sleeve flew a small pale-gold pearl which wobbled as it flew over, releasing waves of golden light that pinned the serpent's tail in place. The two green beams were also blocked by her shield-shaped dharma artifact.
Kong Tingyun then said, "I will leave the rest to you, Brother Jiao!"
Using her artifact to immobilize the serpent's most threatening twin tails and fend off the creature, Kong Tingyun gave Li Yuanjiao the opportunity to move in closer with his sword.
The serpent was in dire straits, and as a last resort, it opened its mouth and spat out a pearl.
The pearl whirled around, emitting a stream of cold, white mist that froze the surrounding area, causing shards of ice to form. However, Li Yuanjiao's expression turned slightly strange.
He subtly curled his finger, activating his Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit, and instantly absorbed a small portion of the cold qi into his hand. He burst out laughing as he said, "What a fine serpent pearl! Too bad you do not understand techniques and can only use cold qi to defend yourself… It is quite amusing!"
With both hands cupped together, the cold qi continuously flowed into his hands, causing the white pearl to lose its rotation and gravitate toward him. A storm of white qi surged into his hands, leaving a narrow ice pillar in the water.
Disciples of immortal sects indeed possess many immortal techniques…
The Hooked Serpent, now in utter despair, had lost its serpent pearl.
Kong Tingyun threw out a golden mountain which pressed down on the serpent, further weakening it.
The serpent, now near death, cried out desperately, "There is only one portion of Nascent Origin True Water in the mountain's depths… How do you two plan to divide it?"
Hearing this, Kong Tingyun's expression changed dramatically, a slight hint of anger crossing her face. She performed a hand seal, causing the golden mountain to shine even brighter, crushing the serpent further until it coughed up blood.
The female cultivator scolded, "Stop spouting nonsense!"
Li Yuanjiao, noticing her reaction, immediately understood the situation. He took a few steps forward and seized the serpent pearl in his hand, then severed its connection with the creature and stored it in his storage pouch. He then said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist, dispel the formation quickly."
As soon as these words left his lips, he was already standing in front of Kong Tingyun with one hand on his sword, his face full of vigilance. Kong Tingyun pursed her lips and dispelled the formation while Li Yuanjiao, without hesitation, grabbed the formation plate in his hand, finally letting out a small sigh of relief.
I fear she might let greed cloud her judgment and try to trap and kill me here. Although she certainly wouldn't stand a chance against me, offending Profound Peak Gate would be a major issue.
Li Yuanjiao quickly landed in front of the mountain and sealed the Hooked Serpent's Dao foundation. Only then did he turn back, speaking in a deep voice, "Care to explain, fellow Daoist?"
Kong Tingyun put away her pearl and golden mountain artifacts, saying apologetically, "I did indeed deceive you… Although the hooks on the serpent's tail are also something I need, the real goal was this Nascent Origin True Water."
She explained softly, "Profound Peak Gate has a secret method. Years ago, I noticed changes in the water veins and realized that a spirit water would soon be born here. Fearing it would be taken by someone else, I secretly concealed the water veins, intending to retrieve it later. This place was later unexpectedly occupied by the Hooked Serpent. I just wanted to find someone to help remove this demonic creature so I could obtain the spirit water…"
Li Yuanjiao, being well-versed in deception himself, did not feel particularly angry. After all, everyone relied on their own abilities. He nodded and said, "So, in truth, you never fought the Hooked Serpent. You already knew it was here, and all those previous actions were just to disguise this desolate mountain… And as for not seeking help from your fellow disciples, I assume it is because you were afraid they would see through your method of concealing the water veins?"
Kong Tingyun smiled and nodded, replying, "Exactly. Who would have thought that this demon serpent would also discover the spirit water? My efforts were in vain…"
The two exchanged glances, and Kong Tingyun spoke in a serious tone, "The Tail Hooks and the Nascent Origin True Water are both things I must obtain! I hope you can part with them, fellow Daoist…"
Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes slightly, lifting the weakened Hooked Serpent from the lake as he replied, "I want the Hooked Serpent and the serpent pearl, and I will need another portion of spirit water to compensate for my efforts."
Kong Tingyun shook her head and said, "You ask for too much, fellow Daoist. I do not have any other spirit water… Please, consider another reward…"
Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment and then responded, "Does your gate have anyone who can cultivate a fire vein? I ask that you help my Li Family cultivate one."
Kong Tingyun smiled slightly and said, "We do have such people! My senior brother has already gone out, and when he returns in some time, he can visit your clan to cultivate a fire vein. But… Why are you so confident that I will not go back on my word?"
With this, Kong Tingyun's tone became slightly cunning as she blinked her large eyes and smiled at him.
Li Yuanjiao shook his head, pulled out a green formation plate from his storage pouch, and calmly said, "Your Foundation Establishment Realm formation plate is still in my hands, and I am sure it is worth much more than a fire vein."
Kong Tingyun was taken aback. She had not expected that he had already thought several steps ahead when he made his first move. She bit her lip as she glared at him, but then could not help but laugh, saying, "Li Yuanjiao, you are indeed the most cunning person I have ever met!"
Li Yuanjiao retrieved the formation plate, already calculating in his mind how he could maximize the benefits by borrowing this formation for a while. He responded, "You flatter me. Under Azure Pond's governance, those who are not cunning or ruthless are long dead."
Kong Tingyun smiled faintly, forming a hand seal as she silently searched for the spirit water. Li Yuanjiao took the opportunity to ask, "What kind of treasure is this Nascent Origin True Water?"
Kong Tingyun seemed to be in a good mood, humming a tune as she replied with a smile, "Brother Yuanjiao, this Nascent Origin True Water is a top-grade spirit water. You are cunning and decisive; I am actually afraid that if I tell you its use and value, you might turn around and rob me of it… With the formation still in your hands, this little girl is really quite scared."
Li Yuanjiao was momentarily taken aback, then backed off with a somewhat sheepish expression. Kong Tingyun glanced at him and asked softly, "Does your clan have any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators? Perhaps someone with a similar temperament as you and has not yet married into the Xiao Family?"
Li Yuanjiao was baffled by this question and frowned.
"None."
Kong Tingyun sighed slightly, lowering her gaze as she began to lament, "I spent years in seclusion during my youth, and in the blink of an eye, more than forty years have passed. It is difficult to find a kindred spirit within the gate, and the few Foundation Establishment Realm male cultivators are really quite unremarkable…"
Li Yuanjiao immediately understood and offered some advice, "Choosing a Dao companion is something that must be done with great care. It is better to wait a little longer. The Dao is full of dangers, and if you choose a fool, it could bring disaster for three generations and ruin for a century—it is not something to take lightly."
"You're right," Kong Tingyun said as she bit her lip and continued softly, "The ancient times are distant and their records are lost; even in more recent history, there have been Dao Embryos who were harmed by the Dao companions in their family… How could we, mere small cultivators, claim to understand such matters? Perhaps remaining alone is the more prudent choice…"
Li Yuanjiao remained silent, which only deepened Kong Tingyun's worries. She continued to cast her spell wordlessly, holding the jade bottle in the air until a light green spirit water emerged from the ground, bringing some joy to her face.
After erasing all traces in the lake, Li Yuanjiao bade her farewell and left. Kong Tingyun watched him as he flew away, carrying the massive Hooked Serpent, until finally he disappeared on the horizon.
"What was I even thinking..?"
Kong Tingyun sighed. She patted her forehead with a wry smile and rode the wind back to face the gate's internal affairs alone.
