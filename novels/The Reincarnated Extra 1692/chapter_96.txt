The Triumphal Return of Emi and Kamasse
* * *
“Attention please! Those joining the estimated ‘Togūdo Commander’ subjugation squad, please line up here! We’ll be departing in 10 minutes!”
Inwardly irritated, the Adventurer’s Guild Yoshanka branch receptionist Pilitza raised her voice louder than usual to organize the oblivious adventurers into lines.
A special red Togūdo specimen with commanding abilities had appeared.
Currently, the silver-haired young adventurer Kamasse was the sole person fending off the Togūdo alone.
This information brought by a Rank 54 adventurer sent shockwaves through the Yoshanka branch!
This red Togūdo was undoubtedly the “subjugate with full force upon discovery” Togūdo Commander renowned for its supreme leadership.
Not only was the silver-haired young adventurer’s life in peril, but leaving it unchecked risked grave damage to Yoshanka town itself.
A subjugation squad needed to be assembled immediately to hunt down and slay this red Togūdo.
“A red Togūdo…..you said a Togūdo Commander?”
“Heheh! If we take that thing down, we’ll make a name for ourselves too!”
“…………”
Some calmly organized the information and prepared.
Others grew excited, raising their spirits.
Yet others trembled nervously.
The adventurers’ reactions varied, but those gathering for such an emergency subjugation request were naturally hot-blooded warriors all.
What they shared was an eagerness to battle this unseen formidable foe, a burning passion.
Currently, the Yoshanka branch lobby was enveloped in an abnormal fervor and excitement radiating from the adventurers.
Meanwhile, receptionist Pilitza’s heart had turned utterly cold.
(This guarantees overtime tonight, doesn’t it~? Ah~, how troublesome!!)
For this emergency subjugation request, the client was listed as the “Adventurer’s Guild Yoshanka Branch” itself.
In cases of high public importance and urgency, the guild could become the client, with all adventurer rewards then covered by guild funds.
And for large-scale subjugation requests mobilizing numerous adventurers like this time, the accompanying paperwork was excruciatingly tedious!
Evaluating each adventurer’s individual contribution as accurately as possible to fairly allocate proper rewards and contribution points without causing any dissatisfaction…
For an administrative staff member like Pilitza, it was an nightmarish endless slog awaiting her.
The Yoshanka branch had been operated by just three employees – an extremely small offshoot.
Yet for some reason, a number of adventurers well exceeding this tiny branch’s capacity had gathered in Yoshanka, with nearly 30 already assembled for this request alone.
On top of that, the branch chief was currently away on business.
Pilitza and her remaining colleague would have to somehow handle this hellish paperwork simultaneously with their usual duties.
……Even someone other than the depraved receptionist Pilitza would grimace at the prospect.
Considering the potential town damages from leaving the Togūdo Commander unchecked, there was no room to complain, but no such damages had really occurred yet at this stage.
The extent was merely the reporting adventurer’s comrade getting injured.
Since Pilitza herself hadn’t suffered any harm, as is human nature, she couldn’t fully recognize the crisis as such.
Well, in any case.
Even if inwardly overflowing with discontent, Pilitza was still a professional.
Not showing a hint of displeasure on her face, she continued addressing the adventurers.
(Ah— I’m so irritated—!!!)
On the verge of throwing a tantrum, she barely managed to suppress herself by mentally counting the stacks of money in her mind.
That cursed child would surely bring Cysh Grass again tonight.
The money piled in her room would grow even more. How delightful!
……And then, at that moment!
“Excuse me! Let me through here!”
A young voice rang out through the crowded lobby.
The clamorous room gradually fell silent starting from the branch entrance where the voice originated, as everyone turned to see the commotion.
And they were left dumbstruck.
Standing there was the silver-haired young adventurer Kamasse.
Despite his youth, his combat prowess was unparalleled, his knowledge profound.
Among the adventurers at the Yoshanka branch, there were likely none unfamiliar with this genius.
And he was the very person who had acted as a decoy to allow the injured adventurer to flee, singlehandedly intercepting the Togūdo Commander’s assault, supposedly the one needing rescue.
“Y-You! You’re unharmed!”
The Rank 54 adventurer whom Kamasse had saved pushed through the crowd toward him.
“Of course! And behold…!”
Answering energetically, Kamasse simultaneously raised the massive object he carried in his arms overhead!
It was a severed head.
Sporting red feathery fur, incomparably larger than any ordinary specimen – a Togūdo’s severed head.
In other words—
“My apologies for gathering you all, but as you can see! The Togūdo Commander has already been subjugated by us! The crisis facing Yoshanka is over!!”
An instant of silence enveloped the room.
“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh——————!!!!!”
Before immediately erupting into deafening cheers filling the space.
“No way, seriously!?”
“Damn it! There goes our chance to shine!”
“As expected of the genius prodigy! That reputation is no falsehood!”
“Kamasse! Kamasse!”
“Kamasse! Kamasse! Kamasse!”
Exclamations of astonishment, envy, and admiration.
Followed by a thunderous chant of Kamasse’s name!
“W-Wait, wait wait! All of you, quiet down for a moment!”
The very Kamasse hurriedly silenced the rambunctious adventurers.
“Don’t misunderstand! I wasn’t the main force that subjugated the Commander! I only provided support…! Hey! Don’t try hiding over there! Come out front properly!”
Saying that, he grabbed the arm of a girl who had “somehow” positioned herself behind him, pulling her forward.
Upon seeing this girl’s appearance, the branch office fell silent once more.
However, this silence carried a different impression from before – a palpable spreading of aversion and discomfort among the adventurers.
The girl Kamasse had casually brought to the fore had black hair and black eyes.
She was the cursed child girl often spotted around Yoshanka.
Observing the surrounding adventurers’ reactions, Kamasse voiced his displeasure with a frown.
“Hey! What’s with those looks!? Well, I get it, she’s a cursed child so that’s the initial reaction, I understand. I was the same. But still! This girl is amazing, you know!”
Naturally, even Kamasse was well aware of the widespread disdain for cursed children.
Which was precisely why he dragged the reluctant Emi into this venue – to proclaim her exploits and capabilities, appealing for her to be acknowledged as a capable asset.
And to elevate Emi’s standing in this town, even if only slightly, preventing her from receiving any further undue treatment.
That was Kamasse’s intention for insisting Emi accompany the subjugation report, his way to repay the debt he owed her.
“Listen up! She’s incredibly strong! For this Togūdo Commander, she pretty much single-handedly handled the actual combat herself!”
Preposterous!?
At such a young age?
A cursed child at that!?
Unrest rippled through the crowd.
Sensing the atmosphere had settled, Kamasse continued with a wry smile.
“Engrave this well! This girl is the savior of our town! And a ‘future great hero’!! Her name is…!”
BANG!!!
However, Kamasse’s declaration was interrupted by a group that suddenly barged into the branch office.
“There she is! The cursed child!”
The intruders were the Togūdo Skewer stall owner Baccarou, Sea Breeze Inn innkeeper Harinna, and the elderly Kansenya shop proprietress Kansenjoba – prominent leaders representing the Yoshanka Trade Association.
“Your debt collection has finally come due! Surrender yourself!”
And leading this emboldened group was the young guard Yoza!
