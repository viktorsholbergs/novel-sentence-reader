"Hoo, Old Ox, we're finally back," Chen Xun said happily as he looked around at the bustling human world. "It's better in the city, I'm tired of seeing sand every day. My eyes are practically yellow now."
"Moo, moo~~" chuckled the big black ox, sniffing the air filled with the scent of food all around the city.
In the Tian Duan Great Plain, the environment was enough to drive even an ox mad.
They walked slowly, taking in the sights and sounds, and even stopped by an herb shop to exchange some rare herbs for silver.
Chen Xun couldn't resist his nature, bargaining with the shopkeeper for what seemed like ages, his spit flying everywhere.
Even the big black ox was tempted to join in with a couple of "moos". These herbs weren't picked out of thin air; they took a lot of effort to obtain.
Finally, Chen Xun walked out with a satisfied expression. When it came to bargaining, he never backed down from anyone. Then he led the big black ox down the street.
The shopkeeper stood at the door, dumbfounded. The man looked quite young and naive, but who would have thought he was an old wanderer!
The streets were wide open, with many brothels and teahouses. There were calls everywhere, all aimed at making money from these wandering guests.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stopped by a steamed bun stall, where the tantalizing aroma wafted through the air. The owner, already in middle age, ran the shop with his wife.
The shopkeeper, seeing Chen Xun standing there for quite some time, warmly asked, "Little brother, what would you like to eat?"
Chen Xun's eyes lit up, and he pointed to the tallest stack of baskets, exclaiming loudly, "Boss, a basket of meat buns; no, two baskets!"
"Moo~" The big black ox's eyes couldn't leave the meat buns; it had been years since they had eaten meat, and they were starting to forget the taste.
Although the Golden Core Realm could undergo internal fasting and didn't have the feeling of lying on a haystack, there still wasn't a feeling of fullness. Life would be much less joyful without eating.
"Alright!" the shopkeeper replied enthusiastically, wrapping up the buns in oil paper. He must have been a Wanderer himself when he was younger.
Chen Xun took them and handed over the copper coins to the shopkeeper's wife, then said thank you before leaving.
As they walked down the road, Chen Xun and the big black ox devoured the meat buns like they hadn't eaten meat in eight lifetimes, their mouths full of oil.
"Old Ox, there's so much meat filling in these buns," Chen Xun said with his cheeks bulging, swallowing it down hungrily.
"Moo~~" The big black ox rolled its tongue and devoured another one, feeling content.
On the street, armed Wanderer people passed by continuously. Sometimes they would glance at the man leading an ox, shaking their heads with a cold smile, pretending to be masters.
They arrived at a restaurant called Fragrant Locust Pavilion. Chen Xun suddenly stopped and took a closer look. He must have seen this in Panning City, but he had never seen a brothel before.
The big black ox looked puzzled. What was this place, and why did it feel different? Why did those men look like they were coming home?
The entrance of Fragrant Locust Pavilion was bustling with activity, with women calling out to customers everywhere, sizing up those who passed by.
They also noticed Chen Xun, but with his coarse clothes and straw hat, leading a black ox, it was difficult for him to attract their attention.
"Moo?"
"Hehe, Old Ox, let's go. It's just a brothel."
"Moo~"
The big black ox nodded, seemingly understanding, and followed Chen Xun away.
They spent five days wandering around the border city, eating, and drinking everywhere. Sometimes they even went to watch martial arts competitions, becoming the atmosphere organizers on the side, enjoying themselves to the fullest.
When they left Bai Ling City, Chen Xun bought some herbs, while the big black ox filled a bag with water...
Although they were happy, it seemed they no longer had the sense of belonging they had in Panning City. Their mentality had changed imperceptibly.
Outside Bai Ling City, the autumn wind rustled through, swirling up dust and scattering on the paths.
Chen Xun carried a bamboo basket on his back, swinging a wooden stick casually in his hand, humming a cheerful song.
The big black ox occasionally kicked at fallen leaves, finally feeling at ease in his heart.
Sometimes when they encountered others fighting, their spiritual awareness had already spread out, and they just walked around.
"Old Ox, the mortal world is still better, more free," Chen Xun said, imitating those who competed in martial arts, thrusting a wooden stick straight out. "Those shopkeepers speak nicely, and most people are reasonable."
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox chuckled and nudged Chen Xun, feeling the same.
These cultivators were all very deep-minded, which didn't quite suit their tastes. They preferred simpler people.
"Old Ox, we've been around for so many years; how come we haven't even found a single piece of refined iron?" Chen Xun wondered aloud, pondering seriously. "It's impossible that they're all taken by those sects, right?"
"Moo?!" The big black ox was startled. It was indeed possible. He looked at Chen Xun with conviction.
"Darn it, I knew it. Although Qian Nation is big, after all these years of development, it's unlikely they'd leave anything for us to explore," Chen Xun said with resignation.
"Moo~"
"Forget about Qian Nation; let's go to even bigger places in the future to scavenge. If we don't steal or rob, won't the heavens bless us?"
"Moo, moo~~"
"Haha..."
Chen Xun laughed heartily, leaping up and sweeping his wooden stick, causing countless fallen leaves to fly everywhere, leaving the big black ox covered in them, looking utterly confused.
In the days to come, Chen Xun and the big black ox went to see the great mountains and rivers, crossing thousands of mountains and traversing countless waters, living at ease and with peace of mind.
Sometimes they would catch ghosts and practice medicine, ensuring that Ning Si's medical skills were not lost. But they always demanded a consultation fee, even if it was just a stone.
When they passed by a blacksmith's shop, Chen Xun would also demonstrate his skills. Sun Lao's legacy must not be broken. The blacksmiths were so impressed that they almost knelt down to apprentice themselves.
As they passed through villages, the big black ox would get excited whenever there were weddings or other festivities, knowing it was a good deed!
Chen Xun changed into his best clothes, taking nothing but merit and enjoying the feast. The villagers' eyes sparkled with admiration. Was there really such a professional person in the world?!
In every village, countless unmarried women over thirty were chasing after Chen Xun, causing them to secretly despair, as it seemed they could only watch his back as he walked away.
Chen Xun could only sigh silently. Perhaps this was the charm of a man...
They traveled far and wide, but the most enjoyable moments were still spent admiring the grandeur of the mountains and rivers. Chen Xun and the big black ox could sit motionless for days, feeling a unique sense of cultivation, as if they were in a state of meditation.
When the urge struck, Chen Xun would also paint. His storage bag was full of his "world-shocking" paintings, which he would occasionally take out for the big black ox to admire.
However, despite their trouble-free journey so far, they always managed to stay a step ahead of trouble, and all sorts of conspiracies and schemes were always slow to catch up to them.
But Chen Xun and the big black ox's thieving hearts remained undiminished. Every time they finished sightseeing, whether it was at the bottom of a cliff or in a cave, they always took the time to search thoroughly.
Finally, one sunny noon, trouble found them.
They had entered a cave in a high mountain, with no formations around, and no one inside, they had made sure of that.
But just as they had been searching for half an hour, a pair of lovey-dovey Daoist couples arrived outside, both early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.
They began setting up hidden formations nearby. It seemed like this cave was their secret meeting place. Wasn't that unfortunate?!
The Rogue Set emerged from within their Golden Cores, covering Chen Xun and the big black ox's bodies in an instant, faster than using a storage bag. The big black ox also stood up at the same time.
The pair was about to engage in the "birds and bees" act, but Chen Xun knew he had to do something.
