Central Hall Terrace.
On the steps of the terrace, two straw dummies clad in full armor stood in place. A middle-aged man holding a short halberd stood nearby, slightly bowing, clad in a suit of white armor, silently observing.
Half of his face was hidden by a mask, while the exposed skin on his neck was charred and dark red, giving him a rather terrifying appearance.
Though the man's appearance was fierce, his tone and expression were humble. He stood quietly behind a young boy, watching him thrust and retract his halberd. The clanging of the halberd against the armor echoed as the boy practiced, and after observing for half an hour, the man finally spoke softly, "Your Highness, the Heir, learns exceptionally fast. In just two years, you already show remarkable skill."
The wooden halberd in Li Zhouwei's hands had already been replaced with an iron halberd, though slightly shorter than a normal halberd to match his height, crafted from lightweight spirit iron.
He moved it with both hands, striking, hooking, splitting, and stabbing with practiced precision, the strikes landing neatly in the joints of the armor, creating a clanging chorus of noise. After finishing his set, Li Zhouwei planted the halberd on the ground, wiped away his sweat, and said, "Commander Xu, this is nothing more than playful practice; you flatter me."
The masked man was none other than Xu Gongming. Years ago, he had been disfigured during a devil cultivator attack. Over the years, he had worked diligently, advancing to the mid-stage of Qi Cultivation Realm. Due his average talent, he found progress increasingly difficult.
Following the instructions left by his late elders, Xu Gongming remained meticulous and conscientious. Though he occasionally made minor mistakes, his growing age brought steadier judgment, helping him build a solid reputation for the Xu Family across various towns.
Xu Gongming shook his head and responded, "The halberd is a weapon of dominance. I have trained with both long and short halberds for years and have barely scratched the surface of its intricacies. For the young heir to have reached this level at such a tender age is truly impressive."
Li Zhouwei nodded and set aside the halberd, changed his clothes, and donned a robe. The white-haired ape stood silently by his side, glanced at Xu Gongming, and spoke, "Today is the day for spirit measurement. The heir is headed to Mount Qingdu. Gongming, you may return early."
"Yes, Senior," Xu Gongming replied promptly. The white ape, being old and possessing a high cultivation level, held considerable authority within the Li Family. Xu Gongming quickly took his leave. Li Zhouwei waited on the steps for a while, sipping two mouthfuls of tea. Soon, a young man entered the hall.
Li Chengliao's attire was exceptionally formal today, draped in a gray wolf-fur mantle. The silver-white fur shimmered faintly, accentuating his imposing build with a touch of regal might.
Though the occasion was a spirit measurement, Li Chengliao had already privately assessed his son. Now over seven years old, Li Zhouwei had developed spiritual orifice, putting his father's worries to rest. Still, not knowing the exact quality of his talent, he decided to bring him to the mountain for a formal assessment.
Picking up Li Zhouwei, Li Chengliao said little. He carried him as they stepped onto the wind, his mana glowing brightly as they soared over the lake and landed on Mount Qingdu.
Li Zhouwei found the sensation of riding the wind fascinating. As he steadied himself, he noticed two figures already standing on the mountaintop.
At the forefront stood a middle-aged woman holding a long spear, her hair tied up. Dressed in translucent jade armor, she exuded an air of authority. Beside her was the elder Li Xuanxuan, whom Li Zhouwei recognized.
Li Chengliao cupped his fist in salute and said, "Aunt, you have returned!"
Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow slightly and replied in a gentle voice, "I had matters to attend to and returned home a few days ago. It is just as well, as I can oversee Zhouwei's spirit measurement and guide him into the ancestral hall."
Li Chengliao nodded slightly. Beside him, Li Xuanxuan's elderly face bore a mix of solemnity and anticipation. He said softly, "What comes next... leave it to us. You may wait here on the mountain."
Li Chengliao asked no further questions, nodding before stepping aside. Li Qinghong approached and gently asked Li Zhouwei a few questions. After gazing into his eyes for a few moments, she picked him up, and together, they entered the grand hall atop the mountain.
Li Qinghong paused briefly at the entrance and asked, "Where is Ximing?"
Li Xuanxuan waved a hand and replied, "He is in seclusion, adjusting his state to prepare for a breakthrough to mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. That child cultivates at an astonishing pace. It has only been a few years, and though he has benefitted from the spirit liquids and pills that Xuanfeng brought back, his progress is still remarkable."
Li Qinghong's return this time was indeed motivated by a desire to witness Li Zhouwei receiving the talisman, but she also brought back various pieces of news. She said softly, "The Eastern Sea is becoming increasingly chaotic. I heard that the young master of the Golden Tang Gate mysteriously died at sea. The Golden Tang Gate sent people to investigate multiple times, even requesting assistance from northern Buddhist cultivators, yet they could not trace any signs."
Li Xuanxuan frowned. Given the Li Family's long-standing rivalry with the Golden Tang Gate, he naturally felt no sympathy for them and asked directly, "In that case, what is the Golden Tang Gate's current stance? Their Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have disappeared; do they still dare to investigate?"
"Of course not!" Li Qinghong replied softly, "When I passed through Green Pine Island, I carefully inquired with Zhi'er. The Golden Tang Gate did investigate this far and concluded that a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator might have been involved. They no longer dare to dig deeper. However, to save face, they have sent a team of people into the sea, claiming they are hunting the culprit. In reality, it is just a performative gesture. Their young master's death has humiliated them, so they need to make a show of action, even if they achieve nothing."
Li Qinghong concluded, "It is just a deception for their own disciples and rogue cultivators!"
Li Xuanxuan sighed. "Back in the day, they were so arrogant! But now, after a few short decades of interference from two immortal sects, they have withered away. Their young master was a disgrace, and even their Purple Mansion Realm cultivators vanish without a trace. At this rate, the Golden Tang Gate will soon become nothing more than the minor clan."
The two chatted casually as Li Xuanxuan placed his hand on the child's crown, channeling his spiritual sense and mana to seal his six senses.
After some careful effort, Li Xuanxuan removed his hand, only to find that the child's dark golden eyes remained as lively and focused as before, staring directly back at him. Stunned, he turned to Li Qinghong.
Li Qinghong shook her head and said, "He needs to be aware of this. If it cannot be concealed, so be it."
Li Xuanxuan pondered briefly, then nodded. From his sleeve, he retrieved a scroll and handed it to the boy, speaking softly, "Memorize this thoroughly."
Li Zhouwei nodded quietly. He took the scroll, carefully examined it from beginning to end twice, then handed it back to Li Xuanxuan and said, "I have memorized it."
"Good!" Li Xuanxuan couldn't help but praise him. Considering the text was several thousand characters long and the boy had yet to cultivate, memorizing it so swiftly was no small feat. After testing his recitation a couple of times and confirming he had committed it to memory, Li Xuanxuan continued forward.
The three entered the inner sanctum of the ancestral hall. Li Xuanxuan tapped the barren stone wall a few times, and a stone door gradually emerged.
Screechâ€¦
With a grinding sound, the door opened, revealing an interior chamber. Li Zhouwei's eyes widened as he followed the elders inside. The stone chamber was quiet and smooth, faint white luminescence from pearls illuminating the edges of the stone platform.
His dark golden eyes swept across the room, settling on a green-white spirit sword suspended in midair at the head of the chamber. He thought to himself, This must be the Qingche Sword and the accompanying Sword Manual.
He was about to take his place when Li Xuanxuan's voice interrupted. "Wei'er, kneel."
