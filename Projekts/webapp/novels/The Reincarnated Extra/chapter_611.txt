The Madmen’s Group, The Sunrise Triangle
* * *
“After all, the era of the triangular pyramid…”
“““““After all, the era of the triangular pyramid!!!”””””
“After all, the era of the triangular pyramid.”
“““““After all, the era of the triangular pyramid!!!”””””
People wearing triangular pyramids on their heads, illuminated by flickering torches, surrounded by the smoke of a strange, greenish incense… diligently chanted their sacred words in unison.
Every time they chant the sacred words, they stroke the sides of the triangular pyramids on their heads, from the bottom to the top.
By doing so, their souls are corrected into the purest form… that is, the shape of a triangular pyramid.
And in the next life, they can be reborn as triangular pyramids.
That’s what they believe.
Now, you probably already know.
Yes… they are the mad group, the ‘Sunrise Triangle’, who attacked Mitran and the others!
Every night, they perform these incomprehensible rituals here…!
“After all, the era of the triangular pyramid… hmm.”
Here.
The large triangular pyramid standing on the platform, leading the ceremony… the leader of this group, dressed in a pure white robe with abundant gold thread embroidery, unlike the other triangular pyramids, noticed a man without a triangular pyramid on his head appearing at the entrance of the hall.
It’s the driver, who was manipulating the giant centipede that attacked Mitran and the others, his face hidden by the cloth wrapped around his entire body.
“Everyone, continue the ‘soul polishing’.”
“““““SWIIIIII!! HOH HOH HOOO!!”””””
After giving that instruction to the members of the Sunrise Triangle, Temen descended from the platform and approached the driver.
And without a word, he tapped the driver’s shoulder and urged him to move.
They walked together down a corridor with exposed bedrock, and arrived at the guru’s room.
In other words, Temen’s room.
“I heard the attack failed.”
As soon as the two of them entered the room and closed the door—gacha—Temen, in an irritated voice, said that first.
“…The opponent had a good transporter.”
The driver, on the other hand, leaning against the wall, not at all concerned about Temen’s irritation, muttered quietly.
That attitude irritated Temen even more, and he raised his voice!
“Do you understand!? I don’t care if it’s an archaeologist or whatever… but we can’t let outsiders get the better of us!”
“…………”
Temen, in his anger, grabbed the driver’s collar and easily lifted him up with one hand.
What incredible strength!
But the driver showed no signs of fear.
He remained limp, lifted up without resistance… but the light in his eyes, hidden behind the cloth, was cold and rational.
That further fueled Temen’s anger!
“We will definitely secure the Golden Pyramid!! And we’ll shave down its sides and faces… and turn it into a triangular pyramid!! We will show our faith to God!!”
Consumed by anger, Temen, shouting his reckless plan, threw the driver against the wall!
“Guh… geh…”
The driver, his back hitting the wall hard, coughed.
But his calm demeanor didn’t change.
He immediately straightened his back.
“…I’ll do the work… for the money I was paid. I’m a transporter, after all…”
He said that quietly.
“Hmph… Tomorrow, I’ll go too.”
Temen, rubbing the sides of his pyramid to suppress his anger, sat down on the sofa with a thud.
And then, waving his hand roughly.
“There will be no more failures, Barishdop.”
He urged the driver to leave, calling out his name.
“…………”
The driver… Barishdop.
Without showing any emotion at Temen’s rude treatment.
Silently left the room.
