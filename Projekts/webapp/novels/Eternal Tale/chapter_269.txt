On the main peak, silence lingered for a long time.
"Go, I won’t stop you. I only hope that after learning the truth, you still maintain such unwavering resolve."
"Master..." The man raised his head, eyes tinged with doubt, yet he replied firmly, "I will not waver."
"Hmm."
A vast surge of power rose from the main peak. A teleportation array, shimmering with flowing light, appeared atop the mountain. The man’s gaze sharpened as he resolutely stepped onto the array.
A beam of light shot skyward, enveloping him completely before he vanished.
"Senior Yan Yu, your words back then brought misfortune to the young talents across the Great Li Realm," a self-mocking voice echoed from the main peak. "Surviving in the Great Li Realm... surviving..."
As the voice fell, the teleportation arrays on various peaks began to flicker, and one disciple after another stepped forward fearlessly, ready for the journey. They were fully prepared!
In the Great Li Realm’s Feiyun Province, within the Yu Clan.
Among clusters of classical buildings sat a rich spiritual land, nourished by a fifth-grade spiritual vein exclusively owned by the Yu Clan, envied by others.
In his room, Yu Chen packed his storage ring. Aside from lethal weapons and pills, he carried nothing else.
Nearby, Yu Yiwei stood anxiously, and Old Chu beside her looked equally helpless. With his recent breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage, Yu Chen had a bright future ahead. There was no need to court death.
Those who ventured to the Millennium Heavenly Gate were either limited by resources and talent or at the peak of Nascent Soul, seeking one last chance. But no one with his potential dared tread this path so soon.
"Fifth Brother, can’t you wait? The family’s resources are focused on you now. Going after reaching later stages of Nascent Soul would be better."
Yu Yiwei clasped her hands tightly, her voice filled with worry. "The Corrupted Longevity is the vilest existence. It’s not something ordinary cultivators can contend with."
"Young Master, I agree," Old Chu urged sincerely. "There’s no need to risk it now. The Baili clan doesn’t care for ancient families like ours. You’ll be alone out there..."
"No more."
Yu Chen’s calm gaze cut off Old Chu's words. He pulled out another storage ring. "Seventh Sister, cultivate well at home. These resources, traded with that senior from the Forbidden Sea, should help you break into the Nascent Soul stage."
"Fifth Brother!"
"Young Master!"
"I’ve lost faith in the family. Perhaps at the Celestial River’s edge, I’ll find the true meaning of cultivation." Yu Chen chuckled faintly, a touch of weariness in his tone. "Only there can the Yu Clan’s grasp not reach. If I don’t return, don’t mourn me."
He turned to Old Chu. "Yiwei is in your hands now. She’s too pure-hearted. There’s no telling how many men are eyeing her. Don’t let her be easily deceived."
"Young Master, rest assured," Old Chu bowed deeply, his eyes dim. "I’ll protect the Seventh Miss with my life. No harm will come to her unless they step over my corpse."
Yu Yiwei trembled at these words, unable to speak as if they were parting words.
Yu Chen gave them one last deep look—his true family. Rising slowly, he stepped out and walked away. "I’m leaving."
"Safe travels, Young Master."
"Fifth Brother!"
Yu Yiwei tried to chase him but was stopped by Old Chu. Tears welled in her eyes as she watched his silhouette. This might be the last time she ever saw him.
Outside, Yu Chen looked up at the sky. A shackle seemed to break within him. Smiling faintly, he turned into a streak of light, soaring upward.
In the Great Li Realm’s Jiang Clan, others also took to the skies, their eyes resolute.
But the Jiang Clan’s elder only shook his head, disappointment flashing in his gaze, as though he didn’t wish for them to go.
"Perhaps I should divine, though the result is always the same," the elder sighed, watching the younger generation. "The convergence of stars, fate shifting toward destiny."
As the voice fell, a jade slip seemed to manifest in the void. A drop of essence blood merged with it, evolving fate to glimpse the future.
Crack!
Suddenly, a startling change occurred. The void trembled, and a faint crack appeared on the jade slip. The situation turned unpredictable, foretelling a colossal upheaval!
Splurt!
Splurt!
Two elders suddenly spat out reverse blood, their faces aghast with shock. Their complexions turned gray in an instant, their eyes wide in disbelief. Why such a drastic change?!
"Even our own kin’s fortunes cannot be divined!"
They exchanged stunned looks. Such an event had never occurred before. The jade slip was an ancient heirloom of the Jiang family—a high-grade Earth-tier artifact nearing Heaven-tier, modeled after an ultimate treasure.
Through countless years, it had remained unscathed, passed down for generations. Yet today, this foreboding sign hinted at an uncertain future, heralding unimaginable change.
The Jiang family was on edge, its elder members sensing impending turmoil, their hearts restless with unease.
In the Ten Thousand Mountains of the Great Li Realm, near the Baili clan’s territory, deafening roars of beasts echoed. Gigantic creatures rose from the earth, their gazes fixed on the heavens. One of the great beasts spoke, shaking the mountains and rivers:
"Baili Wentian, the Millennium Heavenly Gate has opened. The descendants of my Nine Hua Demon-Sealing Apes are ready!"
"The vanguard of the Baili clan has already reached the western coast. We await your arrival!"
High in the sky stood a man with an imposing aura. His mere presence sent chills through those who looked at him. His unparalleled demeanor radiated an iron-blooded majesty that dominated the heavens.
"Activate the grand teleportation array!"
"Yes!"
"Yes!"
Roars and shouts erupted from the ground as surging blood energy and boundless power shook the heavens. The grand teleportation arrays blazed with intense spiritual light.
"March through the Heavenly Gate! The thousand-year blood war begins now. Baili clan, heed my command—step into the teleportation array!"
"At the family head's command!"
"At the family head's command!"
"Descendants, follow the Baili clan forward!"
Roar!
Roar!
The Ten Thousand Mountains erupted with frenzied roars.
The earth trembled as deafening footsteps resounded. Violent spiritual energy surged in all directions.
Battle flags of the Baili clan's war camps rose across their lands, each a testament to unyielding will, as countless figures entered the teleportation arrays!
In the distance, more streaks of light arrived one after another, radiating an indomitable aura. They were not from the Baili clan, yet they carried resolute, fearless Daoist hearts.
By the next day, an overwhelming tide of iron-blooded warriors surged across the Great Li Realm. Some sought cultivation, others joined the military, and still others fled enemies. The reasons varied.
But they all shared one destination—the western coast.
As the Heavenly Gate opened, teleportation arrays across all factions waived spiritual stone fees, allowing cultivators and spirit beasts to enter freely.
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
Throughout the Great Li Realm, save for the Buddhist Ten Provinces, towering beams of light shot into the sky. Winds roared, and clouds scattered!
More and more cultivators descended into madness. This was the Great Li Realm’s grand event, igniting the last ember of righteousness in countless hearts—fully unleashed under the Baili clan’s leadership.
The spiritual light from the teleportation arrays grew fiercer and more majestic, shaking the heavens as if cheering for these cultivators’ journey!
The commotion was massive, shocking all sides. Yet, despite the large numbers heading out, they represented only a small fraction of the Great Li Realm's cultivators. The majority still observed from the sidelines.
Each Millennium Heavenly Gate journey marked a generation’s struggle, carving unforgettable chapters into the Great Li Realm's history, stirring awe and fervor.
