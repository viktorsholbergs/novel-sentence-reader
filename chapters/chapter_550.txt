Having made her decision, Li Qinghong was just about to sit down cross-legged when she noticed a faint light flickering outside the formation. Two young men, riding on the wind, entered. One was dressed in a white robe with a handsome face, while the other wore a golden Daoist robe, looking rather downcast.
"Aunt!"
The two were, of course, the Li brothers, Li Xijun and Li Ximing. They landed one after the other, and Li Xijun cupped his fist and announced, "Seventh Brother has broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm! I have brought him here for you to see."
Li Qinghong glanced at Li Ximing. He still had not recovered from his father's passing, and seeing the sorrow on his face, she spoke to him softly, "The timing was unfortunate… Your father did not hold any blame toward you, so you must come to terms with it."
Li Ximing lifted his sleeve and nodded, his expression far more subdued now. He replied quietly, "Now that I have broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, I can bring forward the family's plans for refining a few medicinal pills… I will head to the Alchemy Pavilion on Mount Wutu in the coming days to study the formula for the Barrier Breaking Pill. It would be highly beneficial for those advancing to both the Foundation Establishment and Qi Cultivation Realm."
Li Qinghong nodded approvingly. Her gaze shifted, catching sight of a few blue-gold embroidery patterns peeking out from under his sleeve. Women are often more sensitive to such symbols, and it reminded her of an orchid. She asked him briefly about matters at home, but seeing his low spirits, she held back her suggestions for sparring and let him depart to recover on his own.
Once Li Ximing had left, Li Qinghong turned to Li Xijun and asked, "Jun'er, does Ximing still have any contact with that woman surnamed Meng?"
Li Xijun lowered his gaze and replied quietly, "No, he does not."
Li Qinghong sighed. Not wanting her to press further, Li Xijun quickly changed the topic, asking about her thunder techniques. After Li Qinghong had explained, he nodded, "Indeed, most of it is obsolete, but it still holds some use. If you manage to capture a rare spirit thunder, it will have been worth the trouble."
"It is more than that," Li Qinghong replied softly, continuing, "I find cultivating here on this altar very comfortable… It allows me to summon lightning and channel my qi better than any other cave dwelling back home. You will not have to leave Qingdu Peak just to make space for me."
As they were speaking, a Jade Court Guard approached and reported, "My lords, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Yue has arrived at Qingdu."
Li Qinghong raised her brows slightly and ascended with a crackle of thunder, descending onto the lake's surface. There, she saw a cultivator waiting on a black cloud, his eyes bloodshot and narrow, his vertically slit pupils giving him a rather fierce look. He wore a gray robe and had the appearance of a middle-aged man.
"Hm?"
The Mount Yue cultivator, who was at mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, fixed his gaze on Li Qinghong and spoke in a raspy voice, "Are you a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator of the Li Family?"
"Precisely."
Li Qinghong cupped her fist, recognizing him as Fei Luoya, and, remaining courteous, replied softly, "I am Li Qinghong, and Li Yuanjiao is my elder brother."
"I see."
The middle-aged man nodded just as the lake's surface split open. Li Wushao rode the wind out from below, shadows drifting darkly beneath his robe as he took a silent stance behind Li Qinghong.
From another direction, a golden light streaked upward. Li Ximing, clad in a Daoist robe, arrived on a radiant path, his spell bright and imposing. Seeing the impressive gathering, Fei Luoya immediately grew cautious and stepped back slightly.
"Does the elder have business with us? Why not come down and discuss it in detail?" Li Qinghong asked politely.
Fei Luoya, highly wary, declined to enter the formation, shaking his head repeatedly. After a brief struggle to find his words, he spoke awkwardly, "Well… what Li Yuanjiao promised back then… does it still hold?"
The group froze, unsure of his meaning, and Fei Luoya knew he had no choice but to explain.
It turned out that years ago, several individuals, including Yuan Chengdun, had slain Fu Daimu to the west. His territory had been given entirely to Fei Luoya, who had decided to organize the Mount Yue people to cultivate some spirit paddies.
Li Yuanjiao had suggested that the Li Family could take over the land and, in return, provide Fei Luoya with a portion of the annual harvest. However, Fei Luoya, who was greedy at the time, had refused his offer.
So, he had spent years managing the territory himself, only to realize that the yield was less than half of what Li Yuanjiao had promised. He had even sacrificed much of his cultivation time on the endeavor. Regretful, he had now come seeking out the Li Family again.
Hearing this, the Li Family members were delighted and quickly agreed. They moved on to discuss the details, but Fei Luoya still refused to enter the formation, so they settled on a small courtyard in the town to finalize arrangements.
They had just settled into their seats when Fei Luoya appeared restless and uneasy, as though his true purpose for coming had not yet been revealed. After several moments of awkward silence, he finally spoke, somewhat hesitantly.
"Your esteemed clan seems to be thriving! However… regarding that matter I inquired about years ago… does your clan have any news?"
With Li Yuanjiao absent, Li Qinghong had no idea what this Mount Yue cultivator was referring to. She could only respond diplomatically, "Perhaps my elder brother has already begun assisting you, Senior… But why not tell me about it again?"
Seeing the blank expressions on their faces, Fei Luoya looked briefly frustrated. With a sigh, he clarified, "The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator backing your clan… could they perhaps show me a clear path forward?"
Alas… he wants to join us!
This realization dawned on Li Qinghong finally. Fei Luoya could indeed be a valuable ally. His abilities were well-known—skilled in a variety of shamanic spells learned on Mount Wu, and he was both knowledgeable and capable. The prospect of gaining his support was tempting indeed.
However, their clan had no true Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. Fei Luoya was no fool; he was not someone easily placated without concrete assurance.
Li Qinghong found herself in a predicament and, after a moment's thought, spoke softly, "Ah, so that is the matter! My brother also wishes to introduce you to an appropriate guide, but… meeting a Daoist Master is not so easily arranged. Even we can only do so after rendering great merit… My brother has been sent on a mission and, for now, will not be able to give you a direct answer."
Aware she was speaking to someone from Mount Yue, Li Qinghong kept her words as straightforward as possible, watching his reaction closely.
Fei Luoya paused, seeming to ponder her words. His narrow, vertical pupils fixed on her as realization dawned on him, and he quickly replied, "I understand!"
This young girl means that only if I establish some merit for them will they be able to bring me into the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's fold… I see! So, this is one of those complex customs of the Easterners…
He appeared visibly relieved, managing an awkward smile as he nodded, "If your clan ever needs anything, do not hesitate to ask me!"
Li Qinghong saw that he had understood her intentions. Despite his years of cultivation, Fei Luoya was somewhat inexperienced in dealing with people, but his cautious demeanor revealed his keen awareness.
Now that he had received a tentative commitment, Fei Luoya seemed noticeably more relaxed and had little patience for further conversation. Waving his hand, he said casually, "I am getting closer to the late Foundation Establishment Realm and am focusing on refining my cultivation in preparation for a breakthrough. I will not be staying here any longer… In a few days, I will send Zhu Xian to discuss any further details with you all."
With that, he left without looking back, riding the wind away. Li Qinghong escorted him to the edge of her family's territory, reflecting to herself, This old Mount Yue cultivator grows stronger with each passing year. For now, it's best to stall him with this delay tactic… As for the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, I'll discuss it with my brother once he returns to decide how best to handle it!
