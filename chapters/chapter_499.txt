Li Yuanjiao nodded, following Han Shizhen's line of thought. He asked calmly, "And how do you propose we divide the profits?"
Han Shizhen grinned.
"Now we're talking! Ten Spirit Stones per flower… I take seventy, and you get thirty!"
Li Yuanjiao and Li Xijun were both stunned and shocked at the notion of reselling the flowers at five times its original price. Li Yuanjiao remained silent, but Li Xijun immediately protested, "Senior, that's far too greedy!"
Han Shizhen shook his head confidently and said, "You can certainly try selling it yourself, but if word gets out today, your esteemed family could be attacked and destroyed tomorrow. The Eastern Sea doesn't deal in pleasantries or negotiations!"
"My family takes on the risk of selling this spirit item, drawing the attention of every covetous eye. I wouldn't dare to be involved if my family didn't have some standing in the Eastern Sea!"
Li Yuanjiao, who had been to the Eastern Sea and was already calculating the risks, quickly countered his offer.
"Fifty-fifty split."
"Sixty-forty; that's the most I can offer. I don't like haggling—whatever we decide will be finalized," Han Shizhen replied firmly.
Li Yuanjiao nodded and conceded, "Fine, but I have a condition."
Han Shizhen looked at him intently before saying, "Go ahead, fellow Daoist."
Li Yuanjiao remained calm as he explained, "I want forty percent of the proceeds from the sale of Wanglin Blossoms. You can't pay me four Spirit Stones and then resell these flowers at an inflated price."
Han Shizhen was momentarily stunned as if Li Yuanjiao had read his mind. Laughing to cover his embarrassment, he said, "All right, all right! Fellow Daoist, you don't seem like a typical mainland cultivator… Your thinking is more like ours in the Eastern Sea!"
They discussed the details for a while longer, eventually agreeing on the quantity for the next year.
"Remember, these flowers must not hear crying—if they do, they will wither. They also must not come into contact with gold or jade," Li Yuanjiao reminded.
Han Shizhen nodded, indicating that he understood, and after exchanging some polite words, he asked abruptly, "By the way… is your sister, Li Qinghong, married?"
By now, Li Yuanjiao had gotten used to Han Shizhen's straightforwardness, and answered bluntly, "My little sister follows a unique cultivation path, and she is not able to marry. I hope you understand."
"I apologize for my rudeness," Han Shizhen replied calmly, nodding slightly.
Li Yuanjiao took a sip of tea and lowered his voice to ask, "Fellow Daoist Han... Are there any prominent mainland clans setting up branches in the Eastern Sea?"
During his visit to the Eastern Sea, Li Yuanjiao had tried searching for such clans. However, given the dominance of the three sects and seven gates, these clans could not openly establish themselves overseas, and likely operated under different names.
Now that Han Shizhen, a knowledgeable local, was here, it was the perfect opportunity to ask.
"Of course there are," Han Shizhen responded with a casual shrug.
"But not many. Most are Purple Mansion Realm immortal clans. Even if ordinary clans have enough Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, they rarely manage to secure a foothold overseas... At most, they only have a presence in the market."
He continued, "The Eastern Sea is quite different from the mainland. You can't grow Spirit Paddies on the islands, and danger lurks everywhere. The markets are tightly controlled by the three sects and seven gates. Once a clan establishes power overseas, they're no longer affiliated with the sects or gates. The three sects and seven gates aren't foolish—they wouldn't let you come back."
Han Shizhen glanced at Li Yuanjiao and shook his head gently.
"Although there are some leeways and the three sects and seven gates aren't overly strict, the benefits of doing such are minimal. Many clans keep a branch overseas as a precaution, but very few actually invest the effort to manage it carefully."
Li Yuanjiao nodded thoughtfully as he gathered this information from Han Shizhen. After answering all his questions, Han Shizhen bid farewell and left with his companion.
Li Yuanjiao escorted them out of the territory and returned to the mountain with a satisfied smile.
Li Xijun congratulated him and remarked, "With this additional income, our family will have a surplus of close to twenty Spirit Stones annually! Managing the family affairs will become much more convenient now."
"Yes!" Li Yuanjiao agreed, nodding approvingly. Then, with a more serious tone, he added, "That bit about the devil plague... It's quite intriguing. It seems to reflect the views of the overseas clans on the matter. We should keep it in mind."
"True. Even though the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the mainland collude with each other, they're not entirely unified. The devil plague is being driven by Azure Pond, but there are many factions at play, each with its own agenda," Li Xijun replied with a nod.
The two continued their discussion for a while longer. Then Li Xijun suddenly said, "Granduncle is finally almost done with drawing his talismans…"
Li Yuanjiao nodded in understanding and instructed, "I'll need you to take care of Granduncle's matters. Once you've completed your breakthrough, you can set off."
"Yes, Second Uncle, don't worry about it!" Li Xijun responded readily before heading off to cultivate in seclusion in Qingdu Cave Dwelling.
Left alone in the courtyard, Li Yuanjiao sipped his tea and reflected solemnly to himself, Qinghong will soon emerge from her seclusion... and Kongheng is now as powerful as a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Those two will only be gone for less than half a year, so nothing should go wrong...
He sat for a few moments, gently setting down the jade cup before making up his mind.
Although it's only half a year, I should accompany them with the spirit mist to be safe. We have yet to identify any exceptional talent among the generation of Cheng and Ming. Xijun is the bridge between the older and younger generations… he must be protected at all costs.
With his decision now made, he called Li Wushao over, gave him a few instructions, and entrusted him with the task of looking after the family. He then pulled out the sword manual and began reading again, awaiting the moment when Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan were ready to set off.
After leaving Mount Qingdu, Han Shizhen and his companions headed north. The tough-looking man behind him was the first to speak up.
"Young Master, it seems like the Li Family is interested in establishing a foothold overseas."
Han Shizhen nodded, replying softly, "It's hardly surprising. The Li Family has backings in Azure Pond and can easily access the Eastern Sea… It's only natural they'd think of this. Just think about how many forces in the Eastern Sea are from the mainland!"
He continued, "With the Wanyu Sword Gate, Pure Dao Gate, and Crimson Rock Island battling over the Green Pine Temple Ruins, it's a good time to venture into the sea. If I were Li Yuanjiao, I'd also be thinking about the same thing."
The burly man nodded in agreement but expressed some concern, "I just hope his family is sensible enough not to settle too close to us... We've built a friendship, but we don't want that to turn sour."
Han Shizhen shook his head, answering decisively, "Absolutely not. Li Yuanjiao strikes me as a cautious and discreet man. If his family chooses to establish themselves there, they'll find a remote, sparsely populated island. They'd rather endure hardship and remain hidden than risk exposure."
The man sighed and remarked, "This poor and desolate place... I wonder when our family will be able to secure a foothold on the mainland."
"Once our ancestor reaches the Purple Mansion Realm!" Han Shizhen replied with a confident smile.
"It's not impossible… The mainland is peaceful and prosperous, with the three sects maintaining order. Who wouldn't envy that? Look at Tang Yuanwu and Chang Xiaozi—they came from overseas, and now they've joined the Seven Gates. Maybe someday the Dongliu Gate will be added, and our Han Family will rise."
Han Shizhen added, "As for the Li Family, they're a local power. It's wise to maintain good relations with them. If our family ever manages to establish itself onshore, we'll need the support of these clans… And if our ancestor fails to break through, we can at least call upon a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to help guard the island."
"Yes, Young Master! You are truly farsighted," the man praised him respectfully.
Han Shizhen ignored the flattery, his thoughts elsewhere.
"The situation with the Green Pine Temple Ruins is growing more complicated… I just hope the three sects don't intervene. It would be best if the Wanyu Sword Gate, Pure Dao Gate, and Crimson Rock Island—the three Purple Mansion Realm forces—continue to clash with one another. It would make life much easier for us."
