"Chen Junior Brother, Black Ox."
"Chen Junior Brother, Ox Junior Brother."
Ji Kun and Shi Jing immediately recognized them. At the same time, they shouted in their hearts, their eyes filled with strong astonishment.
A warm flow ran through their hearts, and they began to withdraw their gazes. Their eyes gradually turned cold as they looked towards the north. The formation of the flying treasure ship had been completely set up.
The massive light curtain covered the entire ship, forming a defensive formation that constantly circulated blue light in the air.
Boom—
A deafening roar echoed in the sky. The three treasure ships pierced through the clouds, accelerated in an instant, and disappeared from sight.
The entire Five Elements Sect became empty. All the disciples seemed as if they had suddenly lost their backbone, their faces expressing a mix of excitement and displeasure.
They only hoped that the senior members of the sect would return safely.
Chen Xun, on the peak of the mountain, continued to roar angrily. He looked at the disappearing figures in the north, and his expression was equally unpleasant.
Damn it, he and Old Ox also wanted to go...
Chen Xun's teeth were almost crushed. His heart hurt; it was like his heart was being cut by a knife.
"Old Ox, we shouldn't have gone to that crappy Spirit Medicine Garden in the first place!"
Chen Xun suddenly roared, his eyes bloodshot. "I haven't set foot on the battlefield in my whole damn life! Damn!"
"Moo~" The big black ox's eyes were filled with excitement as it continued to look north. It also wanted to ride on the treasure ship.
"Old Ox, let's go cultivate, damn it."
"Moo~"
Chen Xun led the big black ox down the mountain, cursing all the way. The latter continued to comfort him, saying that without clear thoughts, one couldn't enter meditation.
...
Half a month later, in the Cold Cloud Mountains, the number one Immortal Sect in Zhiyang Prefecture, Purple Cloud Sect, went to war!
Ten warships traversed the sky, numerous flags fluttered, and they stopped at a certain point in the sky. Three elegant women stood at the forefront, their gazes calm.
Inside the warships were both men and women holding magical weapons. There was no trace of weakness in their respectful and stern expressions.
The surrounding sky constantly echoed with loud thunderous noises as warships gathered from various directions, and the sect flags fluttered.
For this battle, many sects had staked everything, burning their bridges.
People crowded on the warships, exuding a fierce killing intent. This battle was only for expanding the territory of the Qian Nation cultivation world!
If one looked down from the sky, the entire Zhiyang Prefecture was constantly surging, and the overwhelming momentum of an impending storm permeated everywhere, making the atmosphere extremely oppressive.
Warships slowly docked at various points in the sky, like towering mountains. Just a glance would be incredibly shocking.
All major Immortal Sects in Zhiyang Prefecture gathered!
All Golden Core stage cultivators stood in midair, creating a tumultuous scene. The winds roared, and the surge of spiritual energy was overwhelming. Silence prevailed, and not a word was spoken.
"Fellow Daoists!"
A woman from the Purple Cloud Sect stood in the sky, and her grand and majestic voice filled the entire gathering place. The imposing manner was stronger than the Golden Core stage.
A Nascent Soul ancestor above the Golden Core stage!
Ji Kun and Shi Jing trembled as they looked at the distant figure in the sky. The legendary figure was unexpectedly young.
Everyone gasped, and there was an instinctive sense of shock and awe. Too powerful; this was a true powerhouse!
"Elders!"
"Elders!"
"Elders!"
Roars echoed from the gathering place, and the sky changed color. The violent fluctuations of spiritual energy became more and more intense. Even the Golden Core cultivators respectfully bowed their heads towards that figure.
"For the cultivation world of our Qian Nation, march forth!"
"Yes!"
"Yes!"
"Yes!"
All the cultivators shouted with fists held high. Their hearts were filled with passion. The warships continuously sailed, and the violent winds roared. Flags fluttered, pointing straight to the north!
All the major sects in Zhiyang Prefecture were ready for battle. A terrifying killing intent that shook the heavens erupted, sweeping through the Nine Heavens!
The entire sky trembled, and even the sand and dust quivered.
Boom—
Boom—
Countless warships finally started moving. The continuous loud noises accompanied the army of cultivators, led by Purple Cloud Sect, headed towards the northern border.
From a bird's eye view, the major immortal sects of the Qian Nation convened simultaneously. Countless armies of cultivators headed towards the northern border.
A continuous surge of spiritual energy resonated in the sky, causing numerous wandering cultivators to tremble and countless commoners to tremble as well.
The Qian Nation imperial family had issued proclamations everywhere, reassuring the people that the immortal army was expanding the territory and that they should not cause trouble.
However, its effect was minimal, and people in various states still trembled in fear. Having lived for more than half their lives, who had ever witnessed such a grand scene?
The major sects of the Qian Nation united, mobilizing the entire cultivation world to attack the Wu Nation!
Majestic spiritual energy erupted in the high sky of the Qian Nation. Looking towards the sky, it was densely covered with warships, like a dark cloud covering the sky, casting a shadow over the land.
The ten overwhelming surges of spiritual energy seemed to want to swallow everything. The heavens and the earth changed color. This was the power of immortals; people everywhere in the Qian Nation knelt in awe.
At the borderlands, vast and boundless, warships were densely spread across the sky of the Wu Nation as well. Banners fluttered, and formidable formations were deployed.
A dozen Nascent Soul ancestors stood with hands behind their backs in the sky, their aura overwhelming. They formed the first iron-blood defense line of the Wu Nation, ready to face the Qian Nation!
Under the scorching sun, a dense array of flags suddenly appeared on the distant horizon.
One after another, warships that covered the sky slowly revealed their figures from the clouds, like giant beasts descending in a grand manner.
A dark shadow cast over the land, the sun was completely blocked, and both light and heat disappeared, leaving only an endless chill...
The united forces of cultivators from major sects of the Qian Nation had arrived!
A vast and overwhelming killing intent swept over, and all the Wu Nation cultivators clenched their magical instruments. Their blood was boiling, and their eyes were fixed on the distant horizon.
"Fellow Daoists, protect the gates of our Wu Nation!"
The dozen Nascent Soul ancestors were furious, their hair dancing wildly. Vast spiritual energy rippled like waves, radiating through the entire Wu Nation border as a united force of cultivators.
"Kill!"
"Kill!"
"Kill!"
The united forces of cultivators from the Qian Nation simultaneously roared. The wind roared, flags fluttered, and yellow sand filled the sky, sweeping across the heavens and the earth. The astonishing killing intent burst forth.
A majestic aura pervaded the heavens and the earth, like gathering storm clouds. The rainbow-colored streams of spiritual energy turned into dazzling rivers hanging horizontally across the sky...
Boom, boom, boom... swoosh, swoosh, swoosh...
The intense and rapid breaking sound of the wind began. At first, tens of thousands of figures collided instantly. Countless spiritual energies erupted completely on the battlefield of the two nations' borders, creating a storm that swept through.
This long-planned great war in the cultivation world of the two nations had finally begun.
...
Five Elements Sect, Huiquan Stream Spirit Medicine Garden.
These days, Chen Xun has completely lost the ability to meditate. The more he thinks, the more uneasy he becomes.
Sitting on the grass, they were pulling and peeling vines. The big black ox kept low gently, looking weakly at the huge Thousand Silk Spirit Vine on the grass.
It carefully pulled the silver threads one by one and peeled off the vines, afraid of angering Chen Xun.
Chen Xun's chest rose and fell slightly as he looked at the Thousand Silk Spirit Vine. The force in his hands became stronger and stronger until it snapped with a crisp sound.
"Moo? Moo?" The big black ox was startled, quickly approaching to comfort, rubbing against Chen Xun continuously, afraid of upsetting him.
"Old Ox... are we doing something that only women do?"
Chen Xun laughed softly, dullly, and terrifyingly. "Ji Senior Brother, Shi Senior Brother, and those fellow disciples, seniors, they will definitely come back safely, right?"
"Moo, moo!" The big black ox's eyes were filled with horror, nodding repeatedly as if it had made a promise to Chen Xun.
"Old Ox, come and sit here."
"Moo~"
"I'm fine. We can't control the grievances between the Wu Nation and the Qian Nation on such a large scale. After going to the battlefield, there will be plenty of opportunities."
Chen Xun sighed deeply, his mood unusually low. He looked into the distance with a trace of worry in his eyes.
Having watched so many war movies in his previous life, when the cultivators' army fought, it was much more intense than guns and cannons. Without strong strength, it would probably be difficult to protect oneself...
