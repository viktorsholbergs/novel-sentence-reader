The cold wind was fierce, and the rain poured down relentlessly. Between heaven and earth, the rain and mist were oppressive, and the thunder hidden within the dark clouds rumbled deeply.
Li Tongya traveled through the wind like a meteor streaking across the sky. Below him, the mountains and forests swayed incessantly in the heavy rain, leaves scattering everywhere. His expression was impassive as he moved through the rain, which gathered around him and transformed into a dozen pale green small serpent dragons that swirled around him, drawn by his Boundless Ocean immortal foundation.
"Mount Bianyan."
He gazed into the distance, his narrowed eyes filled with a gloomy light. The scenery before him flickered and the undulating mountains resembled a cunning viper, twisting and turning. Li Tongya, who had achieved Foundation Establishment Realm over a decade ago, was always calm and clear-headed. However, after flying for just half a day, he now felt muddle-headed and drowsy.
Although he was only a few hundred li away from Mount Bianyan, Li Tongya's speed began slowing. The path before him split into dozens of trails, and he suppressed his anger, thinking to himself, I wonder how many Purple Mansion Realm divine abilities have clashed over the hundreds of li I've flown…
As he struggled to maintain his focus, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his qihai acupoint suddenly shone brightly, and a cool stream of energy flowed from his Shenyang Mansion, clearing his mind.
"This is…"
Li Tongya's drowsiness and distractions were instantly swept away, filling him with joy instead. He sensed the direction of Mount Bianyan and decisively closed his eyes, withdrawing his spiritual sense as he flew straight on ahead.
The mists of Mount Bianyan, perpetually present throughout the year, interwove in the mountains. Now, with the rain clearing the heavens and earth, the scene appeared even more desolate. Trusting his instincts, Li Tongya landed in the mountains. He slowly opened his eyes, then extended his spiritual sense.
Before him lay ruins, the rain splashing recklessly and stirring up droplets of pale red blood. A signboard hung in front of him, broken into three pieces. Despite this, its gilded characters remained glaringly visible.
Zhenhui Temple.
————
In the void beyond Li Tongya's sight, nine beams of light stood suspended in mid-air, each with its own distinct characteristics—some as heavy as mountains, some fluctuating, and others full of vitality. The light of their divine abilities interwove, each pulling the situation in different directions. As these divine abilities clashed together, distortions were created in the void.
As Li Tongya neared Mount Bianyan, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators continuously performed hand seals, until finally, one of them could no longer take it. He stood with hands behind his back and sneered. "It's understandable that everyone wants a share of the metallic essence and fate. However, if something goes wrong and that little snake survives, and the Wrathful Maha realizes something is amiss and reincarnates elsewhere, none of us can bear the consequences!"
As soon as he spoke, another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator laughed mockingly. "Ha, Changxi, it seems you have not managed to cultivate your Life Divine Ability and can only watch on enviously… Do not let it frustrate you into speaking nonsense!"
"You!"
Daoist Master Changxi clearly did not get along with this Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. However, having reached the Purple Mansion Realm, none were fools, and he was not easily angered.[1]
He feigned mild anger and fell silent, but the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator persisted, laughing. "Daoist Chuting attained the Dao through his Life Divine Ability and began developing a second immortal foundation in less than fifty years after his breakthrough… You, having cultivated for a hundred years at the early stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, cannot even compare to a junior. How pathetic."
Daoist Master Changxi merely laughed, replying, "Daoist Chuting is indeed exceptionally talented. I naturally cannot compare. But with important matters at hand, I will not argue with you. Keep an eye on your Guoling Peak so it doesn't end up sinking into the sea."
"Ha… When Duanmu Kui was alive, he was as docile as a quail. Now that he is gone, you have come out to stir trouble…" the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivator mocked.
Daoist Master Changxi merely glanced at him coldly and replied, "If you practiced Fool's Mountain Chase
and heard that the Emperor's Mandate
was destroyed, you'd be terrified enough to disperse your cultivation and start over too."
"Haha." The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator laughed, seemingly agreeing, and finally fell silent.
The others watched silently until a clear voice suddenly said, "Fellow Daoists, he is flying too fast."
The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators continued performing hand seals silently, but some nodded and released their spells. To their surprise, Li Tongya was not only unaffected but paused, closing his eyes for a moment before flying straight toward Mount Bianyan. The clear voice appeared again. "Daoist Chuting! Withdraw your divine ability!"
These cultivators, having attained the Purple Mansion Realm, were all exceptionally perceptive. They immediately understood who would benefit from this and thus who was responsible.
All eyes turned to Xiao Chuting.
Dressed in a white robe and carrying a white jade fishing rod, surrounded by pale blue divine light, he stood motionless, though inwardly alarmed.
I have already withdrawn my divine ability… It was not me! It must be someone else… Could it be the one from Mount Dali or the Yue Cultivating Sect..?
Xiao Chuting scanned his surroundings, his deep thoughts racing. Finding himself inexplicably the target of suspicion, he remained calm and immediately saw an opportunity to claim greater influence. He said gently, "It was a senior who acted, not me."
The other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were momentarily stunned, exchanging looks of surprise and doubt. Someone murmured, "Who in Jiangnan could be so domineering to render our efforts useless? It cannot possibly be Daoist Shangyuan, can it?"
"Shangyuan is a sword immortal, not a shaman immortal. How could it be him? Besides, the Yue Cultivating Sect has always been proudly aloof, why would they intervene in such matters?"
Watching Li Tongya fly straight toward Mount Bianyan, one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator quickly deduced with his fingers and murmured, "At this speed, the timing seems just right. As soon as the Wrathful Maha devours the little snake, the big snake will arrive just in time at this temple."
"So, we will have to fight him in this temple?"
While the two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators were talking, the clear voice, evidently of higher status, interrupted and asked softly, "Daoist Chuting… can you tell us which senior acted?"
Xiao Chuting smiled faintly and replied, "Daoist Tianyuan… I really cannot say."
Xiao Chuting's ambiguous answer caused a moment of awkward silence among the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. Then, someone spoke to ease the tension, saying with a laugh, "As long as the Wrathful Maha possesses the body, it is enough. We do not need to hope for more… After all, moving through the void to manipulate fate is exhausting. It is fine if it is in this temple. We need not wait any longer. Let us eliminate the Maha quickly and return to our duties…"
"Agreed."
With this, several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators voiced their agreement.
One even smiled wryly, saying, "We who have just reached the Purple Mansion Realm cannot roam the void as long as the senior cultivators… We risk losing our divine abilities and cultivation if the Wrathful Maha escapes."
Upon hearing this, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators looked silently toward Daoist Master Tianyuan. After a brief pause, the clear voice replied, "Very well."
The void fell silent. The clear voice spoke no more, and the nine beams of light quietly watched Mount Bianyan below, waiting for the right moment.
