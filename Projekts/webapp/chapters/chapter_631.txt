An Zheyan returned to the mountain. After just four hours, he entered the hall to find that the family head, Li Xicheng, and the heir had already left. Only Li Chengliao remained, seated at the desk.
The setting sun streamed into the hall, casting long shadows across the floor. Li Chengliao stared absentmindedly at the teacup on the desk. An Zheyan bowed deeply and reported, "Young master, the matter has been handled. The Yu Family is in complete disarray, teetering on the edge of collapse. In just a few days, the infighting will create an entirely new situation."
Li Chengliao nodded slightly and replied, "Thank you for your hard work, Peak Guardian."
As the family's Peak Guardian, An Zheyan acknowledged the response with a nod and stepped back. Li Chengliao then summoned Dou Yi and said, "Milin Prefecture will sooner or later belong to our family. We cannot allow it to be ruined by their reckless destruction."
Dou Yi understood immediately and responded, "I will send our people to give them a reminder."
"Good," Li Chengliao said softly. "Let them fight however they please, but if they start slaughtering the common people or destroying spirit fields, they can expect us to settle accounts with them later."
Dou Yi bowed and withdrew. Li Chengliao's expression turned somewhat grim as he toyed with the teacup, lost in thought.
The delay in moving against the Yu Family stemmed from reasons both strategic and deeply personal.
Chief among them was the Li Family's longstanding grudge against the Yu Family. The elder generation of the clan, especially, bore an undying hatred due to the tragic death of the young master Yuanxiu years ago. They had never let go of their bitterness.
These elders held significant sway within the clan and wanted nothing less than to crush the Yu Family outright, to destroy them utterly and avenge their blood. They were not interested in seeing the Yu Family splinter into factions like the Chi or Lu families—such chaos felt unsatisfactory and lacked closure.
Li Xicheng and Li Chengliao, father and son, shared this sentiment. Neither of them had particularly outstanding cultivation, but both hoped to leave their mark on history. For them, having their names recorded in the annals of the family was a goal worth pursuing.
Just a single sentence, like "In the autumn of the seventh month, Young Master Liao destroyed the Yu Clan," would have made Li Chengliao feel his life was complete. If it ended up recorded as a victory over the splintered Chi or Lu families instead, it would lose its grandeur.
Still, no matter what, we must ensure the Yu Family never finds a way to recover, he thought as he sipped his tea. The balance between satisfaction and caution... one always has to compromise.
Li Chengliao stood and finalized his arrangements for the events below the mountain. Then, he rode the wind to Mount Qingdu.
With Li Xijun in seclusion, Qingdu Peak was managed by Li Xuanxuan, with assistance from Li Yuexiang and Li Chengliao. As he landed, he saw Li Yuexiang dressed in white, standing with a sword in hand.
Li Yuexiang practiced the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique and had already reached the early Qi Cultivation Realm. Her abilities were beginning to take shape, with deep red flames swirling around her, coiling along the length of her sword.
Her swordsmanship was decent, and her slender hands twirled the blade gracefully, scattering pheasant flames in all directions in a dazzling display. When her movements ceased, she sheathed her sword and turned her almond-shaped eyes toward Li Chengliao, asking, "How did it go?"
"No major issues," Li Chengliao replied briefly.
He was about to provide more details when the great formation atop the mountain began to shimmer with green light, and a booming male voice rang out, "Yuan Chengdun of Mushroom Forest greets you. I request permission to enter your formation."
"The Yuan Family is here!" Both of their expressions changed.
Li Yuexiang stepped onto a flame cloud and flew up, opening a small gap in Qingdu's Green Ox River Embrace Formation. Blinking, she cupped her fist and greeted softly, "Li Yuexiang of Qingdu greets the Senior."
The man before her exuded a commanding presence, his appearance upright and dignified, with an aura that brooked no disrespect. At his waist hung two short rods etched with intricate patterns, glowing faintly with cyan and yellow light. His cultivation was at the late Foundation Establishment Realm, and his strength was profound.
This man was Yuan Chengdun of Sprawling Azure Mountain, a figure of great renown in the Yuan Family and hailed as their greatest genius in a century. Despite being just over sixty years old, he had already reached the late stages of Foundation Establishment Realm.
When he spoke, his voice was deep and resonant, carrying a weight of authority, "Are you the descendant of an old acquaintance?"
Li Yuexiang invited him into the formation and replied gently, "My father was Li Yuanjiao."
Yuan Chengdun fell silent for a moment before responding, "I once fought alongside your father. Even then, I never saw him exert his full strength... I never imagined he would fall to that man from the Yu Family."
Yuan Chengdun had once fought alongside Li Yuanjiao, slaying a pig demon together and later battling Fu Daimu of Mount Yue. This shared history often came up in conversation.
Li Yuexiang had heard this story so many times over the years that she barely reacted, instead leading Yuan Chengdun onward. She first guided him to pay respects at Li Yuanjiao's shrine, lighting incense for her father, before directing him to the main hall.
The Yuan Family was in considerable disarray these days, leaving little room for involvement in outside matters. As the central figure in their turmoil, Yuan Chengdun's visit was certainly not without purpose. He followed Li Yuexiang into the hall, where Li Xuanxuan was already waiting for him.
Yuan Chengdun, being of the same generation as Li Yuanjiao, greeted Li Xuanxuan as an elder. Despite Yuan Chengdun's formidable reputation—likely unmatched by anyone in Li Xuanxuan's Family except his own younger brother—Li Xuanxuan remained humble and exchanged polite words.
Without any preamble, Yuan Chengdun got straight to the point, "Xizhi, my aunt's eldest disciple, is likely aware of some news. My aunt has been missing in the Eastern Sea for two years now, and there has been no word of her. The rest of my family, short-sighted as they are, are still busy squabbling amongst themselves…"
He paused briefly before continuing in a low voice, "I have no interest in fighting them for control and left them to their mess. I plan to head to the Eastern Sea. I have received some leads suggesting she may be near the Qunyi Strait. My first priority is to find my aunt."
Direct and candid, Yuan Chengdun laid out his plans in just a few sentences. Li Xuanxuan responded courteously, "The Peak Master is an individual of great fortune. I am certain she will be found safe and sound."
"Thank you for your kind words," Yuan Chengdun replied, his voice deep and resonant, like mountain stone. He continued, "As for the Yuan Family… there is little left for me to hold on to. My only obligation is to repay the kindness of my Clan Uncle Yuan Huyuan, who supported me through all these years. But before I leave for the Eastern Sea, there is one matter I cannot let go of."
"I have a son." Yuan Chengdun paused, and Li Yuexiang immediately understood. Her phoenix-like eyes slightly lifted as she focused intently on what he was about to say, "I have only this one child. If I head to the Eastern Sea, there are two risks: my whereabouts will be uncertain, and my safety will be in jeopardy. Should something happen to me out there, my clan uncle will not be able to protect him."
The usually bold and straightforward man seemed slightly embarrassed as he continued, his voice quieter, "I have heard that Yuexiang has not yet been betrothed. On the strength of our past friendship, I have come here boldly to propose an alliance through marriage. Such a union would be mutually beneficial."
He patted his chest and added with conviction, "I will not make empty promises. Over the years, I have fought demons across the land and achieved countless victories. The betrothal gifts I offer will surely satisfy you."
"This…" Li Xuanxuan froze for a full moment, then turned his head to look at the young woman in white. Her phoenix-like eyes met his directly, unflinching, filled with a clarity that struck him like a lightning bolt across the face. His cheeks flushed, his legs grew weak, and he momentarily fell into a trance.
Li Xuanxuan paused, momentarily lost in thought. The old man before him stood with his white hair gently tousled by the wind, the wrinkles on his face faintly trembling. It seemed he wasn't even listening to the conversation anymore. Instead, an image of a face appeared in his mind.
She had round almond eyes, stubborn yet endearing, with a pair of intelligent eyes that stared directly at him. Faintly, a soft voice seemed to echo in his ears, "Elder brother… do you want me to marry Chen Donghe?"
"Jingtian…" Li Xuanxuan muttered weakly under his breath.
