Invisible Slash (Not Quite Invisible)
* * *
In the half year I’ve spent with Master, how have I grown?
What has grown?
Physical strength? Magical power? Mental strength?
Yes, compared to six months ago, all of these have definitely grown.
Body movement? Magic control? Hunting methods? Martial arts?
These skills too.
I’ve grown incomparably more than I was half a year ago.
But, there’s something that must not be forgotten.
Without this, the growth of other powers wouldn’t have been possible, the foundation of my growth.
The foundational power.
That is, observational skills.
Master’s training always lacks explanations.
He just shows a technique and says, try imitating it.
That’s it!
Even sparring is the same.
Just imitate, imitate, imitate everything!
Naturally, my observational skills were honed.
As a result, I’ve come to understand the incredible detail of Master’s magic control more than before, and comparing myself to Master, I felt utterly insignificant, like an ant or even a microbe, overwhelmed by my own weakness, well, things like that happened…
No, no, now’s not the time for such thoughts.
Let’s put that aside.
In short, over the past six months, I learned the importance of keen observation, and my observational skills have been thoroughly sharpened, and that’s what I’m talking about.
And that’s exactly the key to overcoming this pinch.
That’s what I want to say.

「…………」
Silently, I activate 【Magic Perception】.
Master’s training always starts with this.
Since this is the task at hand, I should calmly, as usual, start by observing things.
I watch Master.
Leaping and dancing around, continuing to avoid the so-called 【Invisible Slash】.
His magic manipulation is refined.
Magic flows only to the necessary parts of his body, used only as much as needed.
Absolutely no waste.
That represents just a fraction of the techniques Master has accumulated over his life, and I don’t know how long it will take for me to reach that level.
On the other hand, looking at the bald man.
Even observing his 【Body Strengthening】, it’s clear he’s not as skilled in magic manipulation and control as Master is.
<Well, that probably wasn’t a problem for him, right?>
Yes.
Because, thanks to what the bald man calls his “special ability,” the 【Invisible Slash】, enemies can’t get close to him.
So, what exactly is this 【Invisible Slash】?
…In fact, for me, having activated 【Magic Perception】, it was neither invisible nor anything of the sort.
It extended from the fingertips of the bald man’s waving hands.
It moves swiftly according to the bald man’s will, leaving scars on the ground and trees it touches.
The true nature of the 【Invisible Slash】 is a “thread made of magical power, sharp enough to cut through anything.”
<The 【Invisible Slash】, or rather… should we call it 【Magic Slash Thread】?>
It’s a terrifying technique… Without the ability to see magic, you wouldn’t even be able to grasp the true nature of the attack.
Though, the fact that Master continues to dodge it on instinct might be even more terrifying.
What exactly is a “special ability” anyway?
<It’s not a very meaningful category. Generally, abilities whose principles and methods of acquisition are not well understood are lumped together as “special abilities.” Actually, Emi, your 【Magic Perception】 is also considered a “special ability” due to the very few who can master it.>
Eh? I was already using a “special ability”?
<Perhaps techniques like 【Silverfish】 and 【Mantis】 might also be considered “special abilities” by the public… But, that’s not important right now. The issue is, Emi, what you will do next.>
……
<Even knowing the true nature of the cult leader’s attack, you can’t break the current situation of being captured, can you?>
Just knowing isn’t enough, right.
<Eh?>
Basically, Extra-sama.
When I try to move my body, old man number two tightens his grip.
So, the idea is, without moving much, to defeat this old man number two without him noticing, while still restrained.
<What? Eh?>
The example is right in front of us, isn’t it?
I concentrate again, observing the bald man’s way of fighting.
The bald man, like a conductor, sways his hands to control the 【Magic Slash Thread】, but I think that’s more of a habit.
Since the control of 【Magic Slash Thread】 is done through magic manipulation, technically speaking, body movement shouldn’t be that important.
Well, accompanying body movements might make it easier to visualize magic manipulation, that might be the effect.
Whether the bald man understands that, or is just doing it intuitively, I’m not sure.
Anyway.
【Magic Slash Thread】 is a magical manipulation technique that allows attacking the opponent without moving, with a high potential for surprise attacks.
<…………So, Emi, you are…!>
The task given by Master has now become clear, Extra-sama.
That is… to learn 【Magic Slash Thread】!
