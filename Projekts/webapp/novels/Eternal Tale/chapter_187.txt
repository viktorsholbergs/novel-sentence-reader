"Xuechen gratefully acknowledges the lesson." Jiang Xuechen bowed deeply; her hands cupped in respect. There was a flicker of struggle in her eyes, but it gradually transformed into a look of determination, as if she had made up her mind about something.
Chen Xun gave a slight nod. The flow of spiritual energy within this girl’s body was peculiar, seemingly correct yet somehow not.
The spiritual energy appeared to circulate steadily through her meridians, but there was a slight blockage in the minor circuit and a forced blockage in the major circuit.
A typical Nascent Soul cultivator would be unable to discern this, as they had never refined their spiritual energy to such a degree, unable to detect these subtle differences.
Even if she were to forcefully break through with the use of medicinal pills, it would likely destroy her meridians and her death. To outsiders, this would naturally seem ominous.
"But, Senior, I must tell you the truth—my Jiang family once had a Nascent Soul cultivator."
"Impressive..."
"However, it is recorded that our ancestors encountered misfortune while divining the future and died suddenly." Jiang Xuechen looked cautiously at Chen Xun, "The descendants of that line were also implicated, suffering continuous disasters until the bloodline was extinguished."
_What the heck, that’s unscientific..._
Chen Xun exchanged a glance with the big black ox beside him. Shouldn't this just be a problem with the cultivation method? Could it be related to something supernatural?
"I truly don't understand this, so I won’t add unnecessary analysis that might disturb your mind."
Chen Xun was a bit bewildered. He and the black ox were straightforward beings who had never encountered such strange occurrences, and they were certainly not curious about them.
"Moo~~" The big black ox's eyes showed wisdom. Could it be that only something unseen could counteract another unseen force because there was no merit in their actions?
It waved its hoof, sat cross-legged on the ground, and began performing a ritual. Green smoke curled up around it, and its eyes grew increasingly serene.
Hearing about this, Chen Xun's eyes widened slightly. Seeing the black ox conducting the ritual, he quietly added an incense burner.
In the world of cultivation, nothing is too strange. He was beginning to believe more and more—it’s not superstition...
May the heavens, immortals, and Buddhas protect us!
Chen Xun murmured in his heart, his gaze relaxing, feeling much more at ease.
Jiang Xuechen was stunned by this scene. Where on earth did these two seniors come from?
"Xuechen will remember your words, Senior." Jiang Xuechen sighed softly, realizing that the Jiang family's misfortunes were not as simple as a problem with their cultivation method. She quickly shifted her thoughts and asked, "Senior, what size of flying boat do you require?"
"Estimated to be a hundred zhang long." Chen Xun casually replied with a remark that was anything but ordinary.
"Moo?!" The big black ox, who had been performing the ritual, jumped up in shock. That big?!
"Senior, may I ask, what do you intend to use it for?" Jiang Xuechen’s mouth opened slightly. A flying boat that large could be used as a war artifact; most Nascent Soul elders preferred smaller, more refined vehicles.
"Hehe." Chen Xun gave a mysterious smile and pointed in a direction, "Over there."
"The West? The Tian Duan Plains?!" A gleam of joy appeared in Jiang Xuechen’s eyes. "Senior, do you also believe that there is a path there?"
"Of course, it was once told to me by an old friend." Chen Xun nodded solemnly, gazing into the distance with a serious expression, "There must be a path there. This is also the purpose of my and the old ox’s cultivation."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox grinned, standing on all fours beside Chen Xun.
Jiang Xuechen’s eyes filled with emotion, her smile growing brighter. She, too, had always believed that there was a path there, for her family had originally come from that direction.
But now, even her clansmen no longer believed it, saying that the path had been severed.
"Hmm? Xuechen, what's wrong?" Chen Xun approached slowly, noticing something amiss in her expression.
"Senior, I'll go prepare it for you right away!" Jiang Xuechen suddenly bowed with excitement. After so many years, she had never felt such a thrill in her heart. "I will return next month."
"Alright, I appreciate it." Chen Xun was a bit puzzled, wondering why she seemed even more excited than he was.
**_Whoosh!_**
Dust swirled on the ground as Jiang Xuechen swiftly departed, appearing somewhat hurried.
"Moo?"
"I don't know, let's just continue cultivating."
Chen Xun shrugged, his body turning into a flash of light as he returned to his rocking chair. A pill for nurturing the Nascent Soul appeared in his palm. Without hesitation, he swallowed it, and the pure, immense medicinal power spread throughout his body.
However, Chen Xun remained calm as five Nascent Souls within him continued their cultivation automatically. The big black ox also swallowed a pill, and they both resumed reading, occasionally discussing the future.
A month passed in the blink of an eye, and the agreed-upon time arrived.
Jiang Xuechen led Chen Xun and the big black ox to Flower Rain Valley at Qionghua Peak.
They stood in the sky, looking down. Flower Rain Valley lived up to its name, with flower petals falling like rain everywhere. The valley was filled with rare flowers and herbs, yet it was extremely deep and secluded.
The valley appeared to have been cleared out, but some traces remained, suggesting that this was indeed where Moon Tower constructed their large flying boats.
"Greetings, Senior!"
"Greetings, Senior!"
On the ground within the valley stood over a hundred female cultivators, bowing with their heads lowered. Their voices echoed through the empty valley, resonating continuously.
Among them were Golden Core and Foundation Establishment cultivators. Their attire revealed that they were all artifact refiners from Nine Palaces Mountain.
"Senior, these are all artifact refiners gathered by Moon Tower from various large cities. They have all participated in the crafting of large flying boats and are at your service for any instructions."
"Thank you." Chen Xun felt a surge of excitement—these were all genuine technical experts. "Would it be possible for me to learn from them?"
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox, also somewhat dazed, nodded along, ready to make the flying boat themselves. Time wasn’t a concern.
"Senior, are you planning to craft the artifacts yourself?" Jiang Xuechen asked softly. "It might take quite a bit of time, possibly several decades to a century."
"No problem. If possible, the Foundation Establishment juniors, with my and the old ox's help, can be promoted to the Golden Core stage." Chen Xun’s gaze sharpened as he looked at the female cultivators on the ground. "We'll also do our best to help the Golden Core cultivators improve their cultivation. The condition is that I temporarily need their time to learn the techniques and materials related to crafting the large flying boat. If they’re unwilling, they’re free to leave."
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox danced around, indicating that it agreed with the plan.
"I didn’t expect Senior to be so generous. I'm sure no cultivator could refuse such an offer." Jiang Xuechen’s eyes showed admiration. "I’ll go speak with them now."
She immediately flew down to the valley, her eyes reflecting a sense of mystery. The more she interacted with them, the harder it was to see through them.
It wasn’t long before the valley erupted in a clamor, with the Foundation Establishment female cultivators being the most vocal.
To be personally elevated to the Golden Core stage by a Nascent Soul ancestor—this legendary great fortune had finally fallen into their laps!
Even the female Golden Core cultivators felt their hearts pounding. They never imagined they’d ever have the chance to interact with two Nascent Soul ancestors in their lifetimes.
Jiang Xuechen nodded lightly toward the sky, and Chen Xun smiled, patting the big black ox before instantly appearing on the ground.
Over a hundred artifact refiners blushed, bowing with their heads lowered, occasionally stealing glances at Chen Xun, who remained remarkably composed.
