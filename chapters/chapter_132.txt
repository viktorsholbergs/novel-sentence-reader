"Farewell, Immortal Master!"
As the Dawn Cloudliner ascended from Cloud Crowned Peak, piercing through the clouds and disappearing into the horizon, Li Xuanfeng and the other cultivators stood up. Xiao Chuting, as always, exchanged some pleasantries and waved everyone off before vanishing above Cloud Crowned Peak himself.
The area suddenly buzzed with activity. A crowd quickly surrounded Li Xuanfeng, eager to engage him in conversation.
"Fellow Daoist! I am from the Wu Family in the southern prefecture..."
Before the person could finish, another cupped his fist and interrupted, "I wonder, fellow Daoist, have you taken a spouse? I am from the Chang Family in the eastern prefecture..."
"You!" The two immediately locked horns, teeth gritted in rivalry.
Li Xuanfeng felt a headache coming on when Xiao Yongling quickly intervened to stop them, shouting, "Both of you! This is Cloud Crowned Peak! Please cease and settle your grievances at the foot of the mountain!"
Then, turning to the crowd and cupping his fist, he spoke loudly.
"Fellow Daoists… Brother Li and our Xiao Family have urgent matters to attend to. We must leave Cloud Crowned Peak together now. I suggest you look for another opportunity to make acquaintance. Apologies for the inconvenience."
Without any further interaction with the crowd, he waved his sleeve and rose into the air with Li Xuanfeng, leaving the onlookers to exchange bewildered looks amongst themselves.
As the two landed in the mountains, Li Xuanfeng gave a wry smile while Xiao Yongling shook his head and spoke, his voice barely a whisper.
"People flock to power. The Li family will invariably attract such crowds; best get used to it early... These people greet you with smiles but take offense if you show them disdain. Entertaining each of them would waste much precious time. Best to make a swift exit…"
After saying this, Xiao Yongling carefully observed Li Xuanfeng's reaction, trying to discern if he was annoyed at being pulled away from a potentially flattering moment. Seeing Li Xuanfeng appearing pensive, he nodded with an approving smile and continued, "The esteemed Qingsui Sword Immortal of your family is known throughout the sect! With such a figure's protection, your path ahead will be smooth sailing!"
Li Xuanfeng laughed, his eyes twinkling with joy. "No way! I can hardly measure up to Senior Chuting," he replied modestly.
Seeing his response, Xiao Yongling felt reassured, welcoming Li Xuanfeng inside.
Li Xuanfeng is straightforward and unpretentious; not reckless but strategic, and much more comfortable to deal with than the deep and cautious Li Tongya. With his talent, he is bound to lead the Li Family within a decade… I must stay on his good side.
With such a thought briefly crossing his mind, Xiao Yongling's demeanor became more expressive.
Knowing the preferences of someone like Li Xuanfeng well, he generously said, "I must introduce you… This young master, despite his age, is a renowned formation master in the prefecture. He is famous far and wide, perhaps only second to Wan Huaqian in the last few centuries!"
"Oh?"
Li Xuanfeng looked up expectantly, noticing a young man in a fox fur cloak sitting in the courtyard. He was holding up a cup and reading, his demeanor extraordinary.
The man quickly stood up and cupped his hands to greet them, "I am Liu Changdie, a pleasure to meet you both!"
Li Xuanfeng hurriedly returned the greeting, only to hear Xiao Yongling say with a smile, "This master, upon hearing it was the Li family of Lijing seeking someone, followed me here without a second word. This goes to show how renowned your family has become!"
Li Xuanfeng was taken aback, sensing something amiss. Even the news carried by the fast-moving Dawn Cloudliner have not spread throughout the prefecture yet… How could this person know so soon?
Liu Changdie hurriedly cupped his hands and explained, "I once had the honor of visiting Azure Pond Sect at a friend's invitation, where I met the Qingsui Sword Immortal. We had a delightful exchange, and I was moved by his celestial demeanor. I saw the Qingche Sword… its green and white remarkable beauty is unforgettable to this day in my mind!"
After giving Li Xuanfeng a once over, noting his electric gaze and the wild air about him, he could not help but offer praise.
"Although Old Master Li lives secluded in the mountains without much fame, his descendants each possess their own grace! Truly divine beings!"
Li Xuanfeng laughed heartily, seeing him as a good friend of Li Chejing and appreciating the detailed description. His guard dropped a notch, yet he still remarked with a smile, "I didn't expect this fine gentleman to know so much about my Li family."
Liu Changdie paused, nodding politely with an air of elegance and bringing the conversation to a close, though he was inwardly surprised.
Indeed, the renowned figures of later generations are not to be underestimated! Not to mention the mature and experienced Xiao Yongling of Mount Feather… this Golden Bowstring Li Xuanfeng, though only fifteen, is already wildly sharp and extraordinary!
Back when I went to Eastern Mount Yue to repair the formation for Li Yuanjiao in my previous life after he got drunk, he mentioned that the last two generations of the Li Family both loved and remembered their ancestor. I thought I could use this to bridge a connection, but I almost gave myself away!
His thoughts raced like lightning but he maintained his composure, continuing to chat warmly with the two. Liu Changdie shared his experiences within the Azure Pond Sect, touching on Li Chejing. Both listeners were so engrossed that they failed to scrutinize his expressions closely.
"Whenever the Qingsui Sword Immortal faces an enemy, he invariably starts with a sword draw that resembles a crescent moon or a large white sail… or flicker like a star. Its power is most astonishing, often severely injuring the opponent with a single strike!" Liu Changdie continued nervously, relieved to see the others nodding, much to his own relief.
Thankfully, this Qingsui Sword Immortal went far into the southern wilderness seventy years ago and never returned. Yuanjiao also told me about the sword technique's power, allowing me to fabricate freely without worrying about how to reconcile the tale, otherwise… I'd truly be at a loss!
After more conversation, Xiao Yongling suddenly realized the time and let out a chuckle.
"We've been so caught up in our chat that we've lost track of time, and the sun is about to set! Let's not delay young Xuanfeng's matters!"
Li Xuanfeng came to his senses and slapped his thigh in realization.
"Brother Changdie! How do you think this formation should be set up?"
He detailed the geography and orientation of Mount Lijing, repeating his family's requests. After finishing, he asked tentatively, "Our requirements must withstand attacks from cultivators of the late stage Qi Cultivation Realm… Can Brother Changdie set up such a formation? Also, how many Spirit Stones would it cost to arrange it on Mount Lijing..?"
Liu Changdie nodded, having over a hundred years of experience in setting up formations in his previous and present lives. This grand formation was not exactly a piece of cake for him, but he was indeed well-practiced.
"If arranged according to my idea… we should use twelve formation flags encompassing the neighboring Mount Meichi, turning it into a single mountain with two peaks, employing the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation to envelop both within. With this grand formation, even cultivators of peak Qi Cultivation Realm could be fended off!"
Liu Changdie lifted his head proudly, his obsession with formation techniques in his previous life led him to study them painstakingly, even at the expense of his own cultivation.
Now, his mastery over formation techniques was unmatched on the Guli Road, to the extent that even a few genius formation masters from the three sects and seven schools could hardly compare to his level of expertise. Liu Changdie believed that even Wan Huaqian, if he were to rise from the grave, might not necessarily be his match.
"Incorporating both mountains?! If we could do that, it would be more than ideal!"
Li Xuanfeng was overjoyed. If Mount Meiche could be integrated, consequently securing the cave dwelling's safety and eliminating the need for separate formations for each, it would serve dual purposes.
"It’s just… I wonder how many Spirit Stones it would require..?" Li Xuanfeng did not agree hastily but first asked Liu Changdie for a specific price, his voice trailing off slightly.
"Qingsui Sword Immortal and I are good friends; he has been of great help in my cultivation, for which I am deeply grateful." Liu Changdie nodded sincerely and continued, "I felt an instant connection with Brother Xuanfeng, so I'll speak frankly. I've simulated the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation many times, and to cover these two peaks, the cost should be around eighty to ninety Spirit Stones… with the usual fee starting at one hundred and twenty Spirit Stones."
