Lu Jiangxian sat at the foot of the mountain, watching the moon-white stone spirits hopping around energetically. These spirits, enlivened by his mana, worked diligently within the mirror; their pale blue halos casting shadows that shifted on the ground.
The majority of the buildings within the mirror realm had been repaired, presenting a much more pleasing sight.
For Lu Jiangxian, life within the mirror involved studying shamanic spells and observing the Li Family outside. It was a life marked by simplicity and, at times, monotony. Such was life, caught in a cycle of resignation and boredom.
Now that my study of shamanic spells has made some progress, these years haven't been wasted!
He had not only developed certain cursing techniques but had also discovered blessings and tracking spells. However, for an Artifact Spirit confined to a mirror, these advancements held little practical value.
Yet, Lu Jiangxian sensed the increasing connection between the shamanic spells of Mount Yue and the mirror. As his understanding of this type of spell deepened, he found it easier to manipulate the mirror, allowing him to perform many actions previously thought impossible with them.
His divine sense spilled out of the mirror, and with a loud rumble, the stone door opened. Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling, leading several children, entered.
The refreshing scent of burning incense filled the air, though the children were unable to smell it with their senses still sealed by mana. Hence, they showed no reaction and followed their elders in silence.
Li Yuanjiao, engulfed in darkness and unable to hear or speak, clutched Li Xuanxuan's hand tighter when he felt a reassuring pat on his shoulder.
Following his father's earlier instructions, he kneeled down, his knees cushioned by something soft and smooth as if kneeling on a pad.
Li Tongya had already been waiting inside the stone chamber, silently observing the mirror on the stone platform. He said nothing as the four children kneeled.
He looked at Li Qinghong but did not object to her presence here.
"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine… On behalf of the four children present, I respectfully request the Profound Light! They will dedicate their lives to pursuing the Dao and their destinies rest in your hands… When the time comes, they will remain true to their oath. With this talisman burned, we express our gratitude to the Supreme Yin," he stated with great solemness and sincerity.
Lu Jiangxian's divine sense stirred, sending out invisible, colorless ripples that caused a nearly transparent white glow to emanate from each child's head.
To the far left was the eldest, Li Yuanxiu, who possessed a spiritual orifice and commendable talent. Although he did not match Li Xuanfeng from the previous generation, he was superior to Li Xuanxuan.
A six-cun white glow, indicating his compatibility with the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, hovered above his head. This glow signified that, once he consumed the talisman seed, his cultivation speed could increase by sixty percent due to his inherent spiritual orifice.
In the middle were Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanyun, dressed in black and white respectively. Li Yuanjiao, with a spiritual orifice, showed even greater potential than Li Yuanxiu, as evidenced by the seven-cun white glow above his head.
Li Yuanyun, without a spiritual orifice, also had a seven-cun glow over his head. Lu Jiangxian could only sigh and exclude him from his consideration.
Li Qinghong, the last child, caught Lu Jiangxian's attention. Possessing a spiritual orifice and talents comparable to Li Yuanxiu, her head was crowned with a nine-cun white glow, shining like a faint column of light!
"Li Yuanxiu was indeed a good choice, but based on the future deduced from the Heaven Expanding Profound Talisman for Liu Changdie, there's no sign of Li Yuanxiu in the Li Family's future... Investing comes with risks and requires caution!"
After pondering for a moment, Lu Jiangxian, like an old farmer planning his spring planting, contemplated upon which seed would yield the greatest harvest next year.
The mirror floated up from the stone platform, emitting a faint white light.
"Though Li Tongya wished to grant only one talisman seed to the generation of Yuan, fearing a shortage in a few years, he's unaware that I have three more talisman seeds hidden within the mirror… This decision is not up to him; I'll take both Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong!"
The twelve runes on the mirror lit up one by one, causing a twitch in both Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan's eyes, half-expecting a surge of boiling white moonlight from the mirror's surface.
Lu Jiangxian focused his mana, then released two Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds.
"Here stand the disciples of the Li Family—who have forsaken their worldly attachments, ceased all transgression, and severed their roots of evil. To them, I bestow the Profound Light, initiating their journey in the path of Dao, transforming them from mere mortals to saints. They will begin with discipline and ultimately ascend to truth! I grant them a scroll of the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, along with a tracing technique!"
Two white orbs leaped from the mirror's surface like water droplets, round and beaming with white light, illuminating the courtyard in a white expanse. The children, their senses still sealed, remained unaware while Li Tongya watched on, momentarily stunned.
The two Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds sunk into the Shenyang Mansions between the eyebrows of both Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong, one after the other. Since neither had practiced the Reception Method, the talisman seeds did not follow the meridian pathways to settle in the Qihai acupoint but instead remained quietly hidden at their Shenyang Mansion, awaiting future activation through the given method.
Li Yuanjiao felt a cool sensation on his forehead as if something had shone upon it, while Li Qinghong frowned slightly. An image of a bright moon appeared on their foreheads, flickering briefly before vanishing.
Li Xuanxuan was stunned. He had not expected the mirror to choose Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong over Li Yuanxiu. Turning to Li Tongya, he whispered, "This...
"Take the children out first."
Li Tongya shook his head, signaling Li Xuanling to take Li Yuanxiu and the three others away.
Then, Li Xuanxuan hastily said, "This... How shall we resolve this? As the eldest of his generation and possessing a spiritual orifice, the family is ultimately to be entrusted to Li Yuanxiu! How can we possibly hide this from him?!"
"There's no need for us to hide anything... Yuanxiu is generous and kind; he won't be jealous of his younger cousins."
Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan exited the stone chamber, still concerned. Li Tongya gravely added, "My worry isn't about Yuanxiu. Yuanxiu himself is generous, but not all future descendants might share his temperament. With only one or two talisman seeds per generation, those who receive them may become proud… Affairs of the world suffer not from scarcity but from uneven distribution. Over time, if we cannot manage our clan properly, it may lead to discord."
Li Xuanxuan also fell silent. The two stood on the mountaintop for a while, facing the cold, biting north wind.
Li Tongya murmured, "For our family members, especially the direct descendants who possess a spiritual orifice or have received a talisman seed, let them be aware of the mirror's existence, but make them take a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath to prevent leaks of information."
"The more people that know about this, the greater the risk of exposure... Second Uncle also knows that the spiritual oath isn't foolproof," Li Xuanxuan added respectfully.
Li Tongya shook his head and replied, "We can only take it one step at a time. At the very least, we must ensure that the next generation won't be divided. The system needs to be improved over generations; there's no measure that can guarantee absolute safety forever."
Meanwhile, in Lixia Prefecture.
The people from Golden Tang Gate had already withdrawn. The blood and corpses in the prefecture town had been cleaned up by scavengers, leaving only scattered traces of life and white, dry bones everywhere.
The now desolate prefecture town echoed with the mournful whistle of the wind as if it were silently weeping. Corpses were left to decay and be devoured by wild animals, while the roads of Lixia were slowly being reclaimed by encroaching wild grass after being deserted for over a year.
The sky above Lixia Prefecture was cloudless. From the south, a figure flew over like a shooting star.
Tied around his waist were five or six medicine pouches, and he carried a long sword on his back. His face showed signs of hardship, including a faint scar on the left cheek.
Looking down at the desolate town below, he sighed sorrowfully and said in a low voice, "Twenty years have gone by… and the Azure Pond Sect has finally allowed me to return. It seems Clan Uncle has also managed to avoid the sect's scrutiny…"
"The time has come to take action for my Xiao Family's cause."
Passing through the deserted town, Cloud Crowned Peak loomed ahead. He felt both joy and sorrow—joy for escaping the clutches of the Azure Pond Sect and returning to his familiar home, and sorrow for having to return his junior brother's belongings.
Shaking his head, he murmured, "How should I face Jing'er's family..."
