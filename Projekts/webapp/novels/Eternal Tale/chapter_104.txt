Boom!
The earth roared with endless thunder.
A heavy thunderbolt rushed down like a waterfall, countless electric arcs spreading towards the summit of the snow-capped mountain.
"You damn it, not giving me a chance."
Chen Xun revealed a bloodthirsty smile, his eyes reflecting purple thunderbolts, fearless, rising abruptly!
With a surge of spiritual energy like a spring, he unexpectedly... threw a punch towards the thunderbolt.
At the same time, an endless sea of fireballs slowly spread behind Chen Xun, the sky being dyed red, as if a meteor had descended!
The sky trembled, shaking in all directions, as the sea of fire and the sea of thunder confronted each other!
Rumbling...
Amidst the thunder, there was a burst of heat. As the thunder and fire intertwined, Chen Xun directly confronted the power of the heavenly tribulation!
In the last second, Chen Xun thought: There's no use in being afraid anymore, just go all out; if I'm going to die, I'll die standing. Anyway, immortality is just a pipedream!
In an instant, he was covered by the power of thunder, bathing in the sea of thunder and fire, ignorant of life or death.
...
On the mountainside, the big black ox had already run to the foot of the mountain, the ice and snow around it constantly melting as it trembled while looking up at the sky.
"Moo~~ Moo~~"
The big black ox occasionally let out a cry. This celestial phenomenon was too terrifying. How could there be such a thing? Wasn't it aimed at Chen Xun?!
The power of the thunder tribulation continued to spread, the black clouds pressing down, and the phenomenon became more and more terrifying as Chen Xun's tribulation lasted longer and longer.
The entire snowy peak of the Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun was completely covered, purple thunder flashing, and the big black ox was frightened and trembling, its cries filled with alarm.
In this situation, how could Chen Xun hold on?
The big black ox and Chen Xun had never used their full strength before; they had no idea how strong they really were.
Two hours later, the shocking phenomenon finally alarmed various sects.
However, they also managed to buy a lot of time, and Chen Xun didn't know that his tribulation would be struck by lightning. If it were in an ordinary place, it would have been discovered long ago.
Outside the Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun, many cultivators looked at the distant sky in shock; it was too exaggerated.
"The heavenly thunder gathers, but the spiritual energy is not visible, and there is no thunder falling."
"Has the Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun already been explored by various major sects, and there are no spiritual veins?"
"Could this be some kind of strange celestial phenomenon? What do fellow daoists think?"
A group of Qi Refining Stage cultivators frowned and discussed; their knowledge was shallow, and they completely couldn't understand.
But they only dared to look from a distance; they weren't that reckless, and the benefits weren't for cultivators at the Qi Refining Stage.
With such a terrifying phenomenon, if there were any major dangers, it would be time for friends and family to come for a meal.
On another peak, three Foundation Building Stage cultivators looked at the sky from afar, with a hint of doubt in their eyes.
"Senior Brother Hu, what's going on? Why does it feel a bit strange?"
"Yeah, Senior Brother Hu, could it be that some treasure is born?"
"It's possible; there are no spiritual veins there, but there may be some ancient treasures unexpectedly unearthed."
The three of them spoke one after another, but Senior Brother Hu's eyes were filled with deep unease.
Even if some treasures were to be born, it would definitely not be a good thing, it would be more like a demonic creature.
One of them was eager to try, not wanting to miss the opportunity: "Senior Brother Hu, let's go take a look; if there's danger, we can retreat later."
Another one showed hesitation in his eyes and also said, "Junior Brother has the same idea."
Senior Brother Hu stood with his hands behind his back, looking deeply at the two of them: "My advice is not to go; there are some things that we Foundation Building Stage cultivators cannot touch."
"Senior Brother Hu has excellent aptitude, but Junior Brother does not have the same good fortune as Senior Brother and can only seize every opportunity."
"The junior brother also shares this intention."
"I won't stop you; it's just a suggestion."
Senior Brother Hu said lightly, his gaze always fixed on the terrifying phenomenon in the distance, feeling a sense of heart-pounding fear.
The two junior brothers glanced at each other, bid farewell to Senior Brother Hu with a cupped fist salute, and then flew away on their swords.
And there were many others like them, the phenomenon lasted too long, and the area covered by the thunderclouds was too vast. All the cultivators wanted to go and explore what was happening.
But no one thought that someone was undergoing tribulation. Let alone the Golden Core Stage, or even breaking through the Nascent Soul Stage, they had never seen anyone undergoing tribulation. Are you kidding?!
Moreover, major cultivators' breakthroughs usually occurred in places with abundant spiritual energy. No one would do it in barren places because the breakthrough pills didn't have such strong medicinal power.
...
In the Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun, blood was scattered across the snowy fields, dyeing the snow red.
Under the terrifying thunder tribulation, the big black ox, dressed in a fierce bandit outfit, held up the big black coffin with one hand and stood in the air on a flying sword.
The cold wind seemed even colder, and it blew more urgently.
It was completely crimson, already a bit crazy, constantly exhaling, and roaring.
It had clearly warned everyone, using spiritual energy to write words saying there were no treasures here, but these cultivators rushed up like madmen.
The big black ox even let go of a few people at first because they saw that it didn't have murderous intent after seeing its cultivation level and quickly retreated.
But among the few people who let go, there were actually some who came back with a large group of cultivators...
There was a dead silence around the big black ox, as if it had merged into the darkness, and no one could disturb Chen Xun unless they stepped on their own corpses!
Its eyes surged with killing intent, and with a wave of its hoof, the black coffin slowly opened, and countless death energies spread out.
"This person is a demon! Fellow daoists, be careful!"
"It is indeed an evil object, neither human nor ghost!"
"This person's black coffin emits death energy; fellow daoists, don't get entangled!"
"There must be treasures about to appear on the summit; I hope fellow daoists will join forces to deal with the demon, and then share the treasure!"
...
Dozens of Foundation Building Stage cultivators retreated hundreds of feet; none of them wanted to be contaminated by death energy. There were already several fellow daoists bleeding on the snowy field.
The big black ox was uncontrollably furious, already trembling with anger. It had never seen Foundation Building Stage cultivators who were so unreasonable!
Roar!!
The big black ox was completely furious, but it didn't dare to use all its strength. It still had to keep an eye on Chen Xun's side to prevent anyone from sneaking up the mountain!
Its body turned into blue smoke, wandering and flickering, constantly turning into shadows in the air, and more and more incarnations appeared.
The cultivators who were participating or watching were shocked. What kind of spell was this?!
"Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!"
"Spiritual sense can't probe; it can't see clearly!"
"So mysterious!"
"Be careful!"
"Ah!!!"
...
A scream came, and a Foundation Building Mid-stage cultivator was suddenly sucked into the black coffin, flames soaring into the sky, accompanied by miserable screams of pain.
Everyone was full of shock, their breath stagnant, and everyone was silent, all looking at this big black coffin, witnessing this eerie and silent scene.
"Hiss..."
A sound of inhaling cold air arose, and countless shocked and horrified eyes converged on this exceptionally abnormal demon.
"Fellow daoists, let's join forces to suppress this monster!"
"Kill!"
Everyone's faces were solemn as they flew out together, launching attacks with their magical weapons and spells, accompanied by sharp sounds and roaring loudly.
