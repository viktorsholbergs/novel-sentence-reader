"Moo!!"
"Roar!!"
The stream of curses stuck in the big black ox and Little Red's throats. Their furious, arrogant expressions instantly turned to shock. When did Big Brother get here?
"Damn it! I’ve finished the business deal, and you two are still shopping?" Chen Xun scolded them in annoyance. Everyone else had a group, but he was all alone; how could he not seem less imposing? "Let’s go, let’s go."
"Moo~~"
"Brother Xun, that was quick! Ox Bro and I were just about to head up."
"Moo moo~~"
"Next time, we should go together for business deals. Man, look at others, all with big entourages. Strength in numbers!" Chen Xun almost believed they were actually about to join him. He lifted Little Red onto the big black ox's back. "Yeah, it’s got to be us brothers together. You two just stand behind me and glare at them."
"Moo moo!"
The big black ox got fired up. This was its specialty! It even nudged Chen Xun, giving him a confident look. Solid plan!
"No problem, Brother Xun! If anyone steps out of line, I’ll bark at them like a mad dog!" Little Red bared its teeth and made fierce gestures, determined to back up Brother Xun. " Brother Ox and I won’t hold you up next time!"
"Haha, good!"
Chen Xun laughed heartily, wrapping his arm around the big black ox’s head as they strolled leisurely down the street. He started bragging, "Do you know how many spirit stones I spent?"
"Moo?!"
"Brother Xun, how much?"
They both looked confused, especially Little Red. Just earlier, Ox Bro had calculated they had only spent about a thousand low-grade spirit stones.
On the bustling street, Chen Xun mysteriously gestured a number—five.
"Moo?"
"Fifty thousand low-grade spirit stones?"
"Guess again. Think bigger."
"Moo moo!"
"Brother Xun, five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones?"
"Heh, please. With just one word from me, I spent five million mid-grade spirit stones!!"
Chen Xun suddenly raised his voice, sending a mental transmission that made their heads buzz.
The big black ox and Little Red's eyes rolled back, nearly passing out. They were speechless; even their pupils trembled, overwhelmed by the shock.
Chen Xun laughed heartily, hugging them tightly and letting out a long breath. What a boast!
Under the stunned gazes of the big black ox and Little Red, the trio quickly vanished into the bustling crowd, heading back to their rundown talisman shop.
Three months later, Chen Xun's communication jade slip was finally activated. The big black ox and Little Red stood proudly behind him, one on each side, exuding an imposing aura. It was time to seal the deal.
Chen Xun's gaze sharpened as he looked in a certain direction and set off.
In a secluded courtyard surrounded by restrictive enchantments, a middle-aged man sat calmly, with over a hundred cultivators stationed around him. Even more hid in the shadows, guarding the area.
Behind him stood a veiled woman—Yun Zheng.
A wisp of yellow dust drifted past the courtyard.
Three figures gradually appeared on the horizon, sending ripples through the hearts of everyone present.
In the distance, a young man approached with a gentle smile. Each step spanned a thousand feet, blending perfectly with nature, leaving behind fleeting afterimages—a truly ethereal sight.
Behind him trailed two spirit beasts, their auras towering. Both stood on two legs with their arms crossed, looking every bit like hired muscle...
But combined with their gray robes, the scene looked... absurd rather than intimidating.
"Welcome, Fellow Daoist." The middle-aged man slowly rose, his expression unreadable. "The materials are ready."
Chen Xun halted, his gaze steady. In that instant, a powerful aura blanketed the entire courtyard, making everyone feel as if they were being watched—even those hidden in the shadows.
Several people frowned, their hearts pounding. This young man was no ordinary figure.
Suddenly, the distant air rippled.
The three figures instantly appeared in the courtyard, looming over the middle-aged man like a dark cloud.
"Moo~~"
The big black ox glanced sideways at the crowd, snorting a blast of hot air, silently noting the abundance of Nascent Soul cultivators.
Little Red’s brow flared with fiery light as its body grew even larger than the big black ox, its aura surging. Time to back up, Brother Xun!
Its gaze casually revealed a trace of slyness as it searched for the weakest human cultivator in the crowd.
Everyone present felt their hearts tighten. When did they arrive? Such terrifying speed!
The middle-aged man took a deep breath. No one understood the immense pressure he felt facing these three. This man... is likely beyond the Nascent Soul stage.
"Fellow Daoist, did you bring the goods?"
"Of course."
The middle-aged man signaled to someone, who respectfully approached and placed two storage rings on the table.
"Little Red, check the goods."
Chen Xun smiled faintly. These materials were prohibited items in the Great Li Realm. "Old Ox, put the spirit stones on the table for our friend to see."
"Moo!"
"No problem, Big Brother!"
The big black ox and Little Red acted in unison. The other side also began inspecting the spirit stones, causing the atmosphere to tense instantly.
"Patriarch, everything is in order."
"No issues!"
Little Red kept its sharp eyes on everyone, stepping back cautiously.
As their voices fell, the tense atmosphere eased immediately. It seemed no one had intentions of betrayal—otherwise, the consequences would be far greater than a dispute between cultivators.
These materials, banned for sale in the Great Li Realm, had required extensive connections for the Sansheng Pavilion to obtain. Even Nascent Soul cultivators were involved.
"As expected of Sansheng Pavilion. I knew I wasn’t wrong to trust you." Chen Xun was very satisfied, putting the two storage rings away. "If there’s a next time, we’ll come to you again."
"You're too polite, Fellow Daoist. Please accept this jade pendant and jade slip." The middle-aged man laughed heartily, appearing quite forthright. "From now on, the three of you are honored guests of Sansheng Pavilion. Anything you need will be offered at the lowest market price."
"Refreshing as always, Fellow Daoist!"
"Senior, your communication jade slip."
At this moment, Yun Zheng stepped forward and respectfully offered it with both hands. "Thank you for trusting this junior and giving me this opportunity."
Chen Xun took it lightly, then turned to the middle-aged man. "Then I’ll accept it. Fellow Daoists, until next time."
"Safe travels, Fellow Daoist."
"Respectfully seeing Senior off."
All the cultivators around cupped their fists, secretly sighing in relief. Thankfully, nothing happened. They hadn't expected such a major deal to conclude so smoothly.
Buzz!
The air rippled, and the three figures vanished instantly without lingering for even a moment.
"Father."
"Well done. You can decide how to handle that matter yourself. The family likely won’t have any objections now."
"Yes!"
Excitement welled up in Yun Zheng's heart. Those seniors had indeed kept their word. To secure this sky-high deal, she had made a solemn pledge to the family.
In truth, no one dared trade with such mysterious cultivators. But their encounter at the Western Sea changed her mind—she trusted her instincts.
The middle-aged man suddenly burst into hearty laughter. A four million mid-grade spirit stone deal had earned the Yun family a clean million in profit!
The connections and influence gained from this deal far exceeded mere spirit stones.
"Everyone, let’s leave this place."
"Yes, Patriarch!"
Excitement filled everyone's eyes. The entire courtyard fell silent as all the cultivators disappeared, leaving only fallen leaves drifting in the air.
Guiyi City.
The two ancient Crane Spirit Trees beside the shabby shop rustled softly as Chen Xun quietly closed the door.
All their gazes shifted in the same direction.
"Brothers, time for the next plan. Destination—beside the Heavenly River."
"Moo moo~~!"
"Got it, Brother Xun!"
The three figures each held sea beast jerky personally made by Chen Xun. Pots, pans, and kitchenware clanged on the big black ox’s back, while Little Red carried numerous storage rings.
At that moment, three crane tree leaves gently drifted down toward them but passed through without any obstruction.
