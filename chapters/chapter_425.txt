Li Qinghong, having waited for some time at the northern peak of the Yuan Family's Mushroom Forest Plain, was met by their descendant. Intimidated by Li Qinghong's formidable presence, the young representative barely dared to speak and instead stayed in one corner like a timid quail.
For Li Qinghong, delivering Spirit Stones to Yuan Huyuan was just an ordinary trip. However, the mirror that was in her chest pocket stirred slightly. Lu Jiangxian extended his divine sense outward, covering the entire northern expanse of the Mushroom Forest Plain.
He scanned the area with his divine sense, revealing various immortal peaks. Most were occupied by minor Embryonic Breathing Realm clans under the Yuan Family's control. Although the family's main peak was away from here, Lu Jiangxian still managed to detect over ten cultivation techniques.
"Secret notes… One set of alchemy and one set of forging… Cultivation techniques… seven Embryonic Breathing, five Qi Cultivation, and two Foundation Establishment realms…" he murmured.
The Mushroom Forest Plain, a region controlled by major clans for centuries, had a more detailed categorization of cultivation methods compared to Moongaze Lake.
While Moongaze Lake's methods were either for Embryonic Breathing or Foundation Establishment realms, Mushroom Forest Plain included a division between Qi Cultivation and Foundation Establishment realms. This division was believed to be a strategic measure employed by the Yuan Family to maintain control over the minor clans under their rule.
Lu Jiangxian set aside the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation techniques for future study and began to examine the two Foundation Establishment Realm techniques.
A Grade Three manual, Azure River Seeking Source Technique, and a Grade Four manual, Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique…
The Azure River Seeking Source Technique, which could form the Dao foundation Grieving River Departure, was the Dao Partner of Boundless Ocean. Practiced by both the Xiao and Yuan families, it was regarded as a decent and somewhat miraculous method of cultivation.
Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique was a Grade Four qi gathering method. Due to changes in the natural world, it had become obsolete. It appeared to be a remnant from a former immortal sect in the south that required the Long Marcing Pheasant Flame spiritual qi.
"The Yuan Family has quite a number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators on their territory. All of them practice various techniques and utilize the unique aspects of their immortal foundations to develop numerous cultivation sites..."
From the various immortal peaks and their treasures, Lu Jiangxian acknowledged that these established clans, with over a hundred years of history, possess considerable hidden treasures. In contrast, the Li Family, still on the rise, had much to catch up on.
As Lu Jiangxian scanned the immortal caves and fire veins on each immortal peak, he nodded in quiet approval. These established prestigious clans with over a century of history had indeed amassed considerable wealth and hidden treasures. In contrast, the Li Family, which had only recently risen to prominence, still had much to do.
Satisfied with his findings, Lu Jiangxian retracted his divine sense into the mirror. As Li Qinghong drew closer to the Li Residence, his view of Moongaze Lake slowly grew clearer.
"It seems the devil cultivators are assaulting all of Moongaze Lake..."
The shores of Moongaze Lake were shrouded in a blood-red light, which also extended to the territories governed by the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of Mount Yue and Daoist He. Despite the ominous glow, these cultivators made no response but continued their silent cultivation on the mountains.
"It appears that the devil plague is either linked to these Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators or they have been warned... The Azure Pond Sect must be planning something big with all these devil cultivators running amok in the region…"
Milin Prefecture was a fertile region with few mountains and forests, featuring only eight or nine small peaks. Five among them had the strongest earth veins that had the richest spiritual energy. The mountains were peppered with many cave dwellings, and most visitors were young cultivators in the early stages of the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Cultivation realms.
The usually bustling prefecture was now desolate. Mana light clashed with devil qi and blood qi in the sky, causing thunderous roars. Jade Smoke Mountain, the dharma artifact, flew here and there, causing loud cries of pain in its wake.
Although the Yu Family had inherited the Jiang Family's legacy, they lacked a competent cultivation technique. The Jiang Family's ancestral secret techniques had long been lost, leaving only a collection of undecipherable jade slips. The Yu Family must rely solely on their dharma artifacts to fend off enemies.
Yu Mugao, observing the dwindling number of his clansmen, assessed the situation. With only six devil cultivators left, he knew they would not be able to breach their family's grand formation.
"There's no need to waste any more time. Disengage and return to the formation!" he commanded.
Yu Mugao was now a late-stage Qi Cultivator and the strongest in his clan. Although he was not a particularly good fighter, having the Jade Smoke Mountain dharma artifact in his possession significantly enhanced his combat capabilities.
With loyal clan members and external cultivators he had personally trained, Yu Mugao faced the demon cultivators. They charged from all directions, exploiting the demons' weaknesses to defeat them one by one. Despite being at a disadvantage in terms of strength, they fought with fierce determination and resolve.
Having expended two Foundation Establishment Realm talismans, Yu Mugao observed that most of the devil cultivators had begun to retreat with severe injuries. With the majority of cities and counties in Milin Prefecture saved, he deemed it unwise to continue fighting and decided to withdraw, heading toward the mountain.
Just as he was about to land in the mountains, his path was blocked by the formation that had just been activated. His loyal clan members behind him began to panic as Yu Mugao froze in his spot.
The formation plate at home has my seal… Why can't I enter the formation?!
His heart pounded with dread. "Open the formation at once!" he demanded urgently.
Yu Mugao's children were among the cultivators guarding the mountain. His seventh and youngest son, Yu Chengyi, recognized his father's voice instantly. He jumped in surprise and was about to open the formation when he was halted. Several elders intervened, holding the formation plate.
"The Family Head's spiritual sense seal is on this plate… There's no reason why he can't open the formation! That must be a devil cultivator impostor!" they said.
Yu Chengyi had always been timid. He hesitated and was quickly overpowered by the authoritative words of his elders. Not only did he not open the formation, but he also did not dare snatch the formation plate from their hands.
Outside, Yu Mugao's voice grew more urgent as he demanded, "Chengyi, open the formation right now!"
The voice was isolated outside the formation. Although Yu Mugao could not see the elders inside the formation, he immediately understood the situation.
To think I'd actually perish at the hands of those juniors! he thought in anguish.
Meanwhile, inside the formation…
Smoke billowed outside and the air was filled with the haunting echoes of miserable screams. The Yu Family's cultivators inside the formation shivered as they watched the man standing at the edge of the formation.
One of them asked nervously, "Master Lu, what should we do…?"
The guest cultivator observed the bloodshed outside with a smirk and reassured them with a smile, "No need to worry... The devil cultivators can't breach the formation. Just wait it out. The situation will resolve itself."
The group huddled in the mountains and waited for several hours. Eventually, the black devil qi began to dissipate, and everything outside the formation soon became visible. One of the Yu Family members came forward and said, "Master Lu, please go out and assess the situation!"
Master Lu nodded. He rode the wind and flew out of the formation to search among the fallen bodies on the ground for a while. Eventually, a big smile appeared on his face. He drew his sword and severed the head of a corpse on the ground, laughing as he made a loud proclamation.
"Rejoice, elders! Yu Mugao is dead!"
He raised the severed head high above his head as if it were a trophy and declared, "The tyrannical lord is dead! The officials and nobles in the prefecture no longer need to live under his oppressive rule! Congratulations, elders!"
Yu Chengyi's face immediately paled as he slumped to the ground, finally realizing the severity of the situation. However, no one paid him any further attention. Amidst the mixed emotions of the crowd, someone called out, "Present the head quickly!"
Another voice shouted in excitement, "Where is the jade seal? Where is his Jade Smoke Mountain?"
Jade Smoke Mountain was a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact that had gained sentience. Only members of the Yu Family's direct lineage could wield it effectively; for anyone else, the jade seal would be as unyielding as a real mountain. Since these demon cultivators were only at the Qi Cultivation Realm, it was unlikely they could take it away.
