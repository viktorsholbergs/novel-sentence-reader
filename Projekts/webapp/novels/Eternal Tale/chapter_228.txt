"These three give off a strange feeling." The man in the green robe rubbed a jade piece between his fingers—neither black nor white—while murmuring to himself, “I wonder what the master's intentions are.”
His gaze remained fixed on the chessboard.
Pa!
A jade piece fell slowly onto the board, and in an instant, overwhelming killing intent surged forth, only to vanish just as quickly.
A flicker of hesitation crossed his eyes. If his master continued to be trapped by this obsession and failed to break through, then the only option would be to... destroy the root of his obsession.
At that moment, a sharp, cold wind swept through the courtyard. Two Nascent Soul cultivators, wearing white masks, appeared like phantoms.
"Greetings, Young Master."
They bowed respectfully, standing in front of the man.
The man in the green robe furrowed his brow slightly. “What is it?”
"Young Master, the share of the Moving Star Mystical Stone mine in the three provinces—Seventh Young Master refuses to yield and has already sent many cultivators to compete with you for it."
“Heh, so bold. Has he found an ally?” The man in the green robe chuckled and picked up another jade piece from the chessboard. “Then let them have it; no need to fight.”
The two Nascent Soul cultivators exchanged glances, realizing that the Young Master had likely set up a scheme in the three provinces.
“When the heavens wish to destroy someone, they first drive them mad. He’s become too greedy.” The man in the green robe spoke indifferently, before shifting the conversation. “You two came here for another reason, didn’t you?”
"Young Master, you’ve been staying here for fifty years. The family head asks when you plan to return to the merchant guild."
As soon as they spoke, they felt a sharp gaze brush against their faces, burning like fire even through their masks.
They quickly bowed their heads, not daring to provoke this true genius of the business world, the future leader of the Great Li Lingxu Merchant Guild.
“I have my own plans. Return and do not come again.” The man in the green robe spoke coldly as if he had no affection for the family. “After I break through to Nascent Soul, I won’t be staying here any longer.”
“Yes.” The two bowed and, with a sigh in their hearts, vanished from the courtyard.
They couldn’t see anything special about this temple. Even the abbot they had observed—a mere early-stage Golden Core cultivator—seemed plain and ordinary. Perhaps wise, but not extraordinarily so.
They had heard whispers of the young master’s connection to his master but didn’t dare to speak more about it.
As their figures disappeared, the man in the green robe returned to his calm state, gazing at the sky, lost in thought.
Years ago, he and his mother had fled a great disaster in their family, escaping from the Lingxu Merchant Guild. Along the way, they were saved by his master, who, at that time, had been full of vitality and brilliance.
He had only been a teenager then, but he had witnessed his master in his prime.
The sheer talent, wisdom, and grand vision of his master still shook him to this day, leaving him in awe.
His mother had been one of the monks of the Great Li Two Sacred Palaces, and his father had been one of the heirs of the Lingxu Merchant Guild—a position filled with peril at every step.
His master had led them through countless dangers, his strength far surpassing that of others in his realm. Later, his mother had been forcibly taken back to the Sacred Palace to continue her cultivation.
The elders of the Sacred Palace were furious beyond words, berating his father for failing to protect his family, and questioning if he was even worthy of being a cultivator.
From that day forward, the Sacred Palace publicly severed ties with the Lingxu Merchant Guild.
His father, after taking power, grew colder and more distant, sinking into depression and pinning all his hopes on his son. The Sacred Palace, too, treated him as one of their own.
He had followed his master for a century, traveling far and wide, but family obligations had eventually forced them to part ways. He hadn’t heard from his master in years.
Four hundred years later, he had finally found the Chan Yin Temple. Fortune had smiled upon him, reuniting him with his master, who had formally taken him as a disciple.
But his master had changed. His once boundless energy and unparalleled strength were now gone, his cultivation seemingly stagnant. He had grown old, silent, and withdrawn.
His master’s origins were a mystery to all but a few, and the man knew a little. His master was born into a hidden noble family.
He had awakened to enlightenment at the age of one, taking joy in reading and studying a hundred schools of thought, with a deep passion for Buddhism and Taoism, though he disliked cultivation. Yet he had achieved the Golden Core within a century. Had he devoted himself fully to cultivation, his progress would have surpassed all others throughout history.
After reaching Golden Core, his master shed his noble status and traveled alone throughout the lands of The Great Li Realm, seeking his path.
But after four centuries, something had changed. Something had happened to his master that led to his current state. The man could only investigate bit by bit, determined to restore his master to his former self.
He longed to see, just once more, the extraordinary talent who had stood atop mountains and commanded the world.
A soft sigh echoed through the courtyard, filled with a profound sense of loneliness, carried away by the cold northern wind into the distance.
...
In the mountain forest outside the temple, Little Red was gasping for breath, trembling in a burrow. He had seen it all—two Nascent Soul-stage human cultivators!
This temple was definitely hiding something. It wasn’t as simple as it seemed. He needed to inform his two big brothers.
Just as he was about to break through the soil, he stopped. They were in meditation and couldn’t be disturbed. Cold sweat dripped down Little Red’s forehead as he waited anxiously.
