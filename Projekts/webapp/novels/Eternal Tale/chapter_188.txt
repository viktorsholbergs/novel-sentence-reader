"In the days to come, we will be spending every moment together. If I offend you in any way, please do not take it to heart."
"Senior, you flatter us. It is truly our fortune."
"Senior's kindness is something we should be grateful for."
"We hope Senior will retract those words."
A chorus of delicate voices responded, causing the big black ox to break out in a slight sweat and subtly step back.
Chen Xun smiled and nodded. With his immense strength, especially standing at the pinnacle of this cultivation world, it was clear that goodwill followed him wherever he went. The world was indeed genuine.
In the following days, Chen Xun and the big black ox became thoroughly busy. Jiang Xuechen assisted by "serving tea and water" and occasionally relayed some messages.
They began by refining small flying boats. Chen Xun was meticulous, asking about every detail, and sometimes his questions were quite peculiar. He left the hundred or so artifact refiners at a loss for words. The big black ox took out a small booklet, jotting down notes and questions about the flying boat's formations. For example, how to accommodate formations, whether a formation too strong could damage the boat, and so on.
These artifact refiners, not having the same stamina as Chen Xun and the big black ox, took breaks while the two continued to cultivate or seek guidance from Snow Listening Valley. The days were busy and fulfilling, and no one dared to trouble them.
...
On the road, in the cold mist, as seasons changed, countless cultivators in the cultivation world drifted along the river of time. A century had passed.
The cultivation worlds of the Qian Nation and the eastern nations had fallen into complete silence, with no major events taking place. News from the north was tightly sealed. Lower and middle-tier cultivators had no idea about the current situation, and the cultivation world was filled with unease and rumors. Some cultivators spread rumors about the Top Ten Sects, resulting in the complete annihilation of the small sects behind these rumors, which quickly silenced the cultivators.
On the stormy forefront, the Top Ten Sects had become quite formidable...
The high-ranking cultivators left behind in both cultivation worlds had gathered and could no longer delay. A major change was imminent in the north.
At that time, Jin Yu intended to take Chen Xun and the big black ox to meet influential Golden Core cultivators to make connections for future interactions. However, they declined, as they were too busy and their focus was elsewhere, unwilling to be drawn into external disturbances.
Over the past century, Chen Xun had invested his immortal points in defense, spiritual energy, and the essence of all things, reaching a total of 200 points, after which the lower threshold was reached, and no further points could be added.
Their current points were: Strength 140, Speed 140, Essence of All Things 172 (140), Spiritual Energy 200 (140), and Defense 200 (140).
Their cultivation had also advanced significantly, heading towards the mid-Nascent Soul stage, though there was still some way to go.
Currently, the Flower Rain Valley was completely sealed by a large formation and designated as a restricted area of Nine Palaces Mountain.
Chen Xun had fulfilled his promise, promoting all these Foundation Establishment artifact refiners to the Golden Core stage, and had also paid the venue fee. However, due to the poisonous breakthrough pills, the path beyond the Golden Core stage was challenging for them.
After Chen Xun mentioned this, the female cultivators had no complaints. The Golden Core stage was already sufficient; they could not wish for the Nascent Soul path. Jiang Xuechen was thoroughly impressed by Chen Xun's generosity, and unknowingly, Moon Tower’s influence had grown significantly...
It should be noted that Moon Tower had sent many Golden Core cultivators to the Northern Border, resulting in a substantial loss of influence.
Today, in Snow Listening Valley, Jiang Xuechen stood respectfully in the center of the hall, looking up at Jin Yu on the steps.
"Xuechen, it seems you have made your decision."
Jin Yu, leaning on a phoenix-headed staff, spoke, Jiang Xuechen's cultivation had now reverted to the early Golden Core stage.
"Yes, Ancestor, the Jiang family now has only me left." Jiang Xuechen's eyes were calm as she had severed her path and was in the process of re-cultivating. "Moreover, Moon Tower must have a Nascent Soul cultivator to oversee it."
Jin Yu's expression was complex as she sighed lightly, "Your mother will not forgive me."
"This is my own choice and has nothing to do with you, Ancestor. The inheritance of Moon Tower cannot be interrupted." Jiang Xuechen's eyes showed determination. The chaos in the cultivation world had made it impossible for her to continue cultivating the traditional methods. "Xuechen has no regrets."
"Child, you have a good heart." Jin Yu gently extended her hand with a kind expression.
A warm, ethereal hand brushed over Jiang Xuechen’s face, causing her to lower her head slightly.
"The resources of Moon Tower are now sufficient for you to reach the Nascent Soul stage." Jin Yu looked outside the hall, murmuring, "It seems there is only enough for you..."
Jiang Xuechen’s pupils constricted as she looked up at Jin Yu, feeling she had aged significantly. "Ancestor..."
"I truly do not know who in this cultivation world deserves Xuechen of Moon Tower." Jin Yu's eyes grew even more benevolent, looking at Jiang Xuechen as if she were seeing her mother; they looked very much alike.
Jiang Xuechen’s brows were serene, and she was not stirred by these words. She was unsure of the Ancestor's intent.
"Xuechen, from now on, Moon Tower will be under your care."
"Ancestor?!"
"Do not say more. I have nothing left to teach you."
Jin Yu’s expression suddenly turned cold, her words leaving no room for objection, as she waved her hand and used her spiritual power to seal Jiang Xuechen.
Jiang Xuechen's pupils dilated sharply as her body struggled. She wondered what the Ancestor was doing.
Jin Yu's coldness gradually faded, and her expression turned warm again. "Daoist Chen, Daoist Ximen, you’ve been waiting for a long time."
"Hahaha... Daoist Jin, you flatter us."
"Moo moo~~"
Two hearty laughs came from outside the hall as they gradually walked in, their presence as impressive as ever.
Chen Xun instinctively looked at Jiang Xuechen, surprised to see that she had severed her path and was re-cultivating. It was truly a great determination; he didn’t dare to do the same, it was too precarious.
"Today, I have invited the two Daoists for an important discussion."
"Speak freely." Chen Xun smiled and cupped his hands. He still held some respect for Jin Yu, considering her their first teacher on the path of cultivation.
The big black ox awkwardly cupped its hands as well, mooing twice and sitting obediently next to Chen Xun.
"I wish to go with cultivators from various factions to explore the Northern Border, though I do not know when I will return." Jin Yu’s expression was sincere as she stepped down the stairs and bowed. "I have seen and appreciated the care you have given to Moon Tower over the past century. I want to thank you here."
"Ah." Chen Xun took a step forward to support Jin Yu. "Daoist, you’re too kind. The old ox and I have also benefited greatly from Moon Tower."
Jin Yu smiled and nodded, speaking from the heart, "You two are truly rare talents in the cultivation world. I was shallow in my understanding back then, and I ask for your forgiveness."
"Daoist Jin, I have already forgotten about that."
Chen Xun waved his hand, not taking Jin Yu’s minor schemes to heart. Other people’s grand enterprises naturally weren’t as carefree as theirs.
"From what Xuechen has said, you wish to cross the Tian Duan Great Plain?"
"Haha, that's right. The old ox and I are just looking to travel and see new places." Chen Xun looked pleased, enjoying sharing such things. "Daoist Jin, I heard there are superpowers there! Daoist Jin, have you ever seen the ocean?! My heavens, there might be one there!" He grew increasingly excited as he spoke, his tone rising.
"Moo moo moo!!" The big black ox also became excited, its head held tightly by Chen Xun.
They exchanged a knowing look and a smile as if they were truly in sync.
