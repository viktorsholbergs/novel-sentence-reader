Chapter 36: None of Them Are Trouble-Free
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
“My Senior Sister may seem calm, but she is actually capricious, just not showing it on her face. As the saying goes, ‘serving a lord is like living with a tiger.’ Being with her is akin to accompanying a ferocious tiger!”
“She indeed is a rare beauty, or rather, the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. But, alas, appearances can be deceiving. Can you imagine, she makes me consume large amounts of wild beast remnants and herbal corpses for meals, and in the dead of night, she even has me completely soaked in water filled with herbal corpses, claiming it will strengthen my physique!”
“There was also a time when I wanted to learn spatial divine arts for convenience in traveling. Instead, she taught me how to shrink myself and held me in her palm, playing with me between her claps!”
Lu Yang vehemently criticized Yunzhi’s atrocities, quickly gaining the sympathy of the little Medicine Kings, who commiserate with him.
The Ginseng Child couldn’t help but say, “Since it’s like that, let’s work together from the inside and outside. You’ll be our inside agent, and we’ll be your external support. Let’s overthrow the female demon now!”
Lu Yang was startled and hastily dissuaded, “Absolutely not, we need to plan this carefully. The Senior Sister, being the top disciple of Dao Seeking Sect, possesses unfathomable cultivation. Just a few of us are hardly a match for her.”
He analyzed calmly, “For safety, it’s better to wait until I reach the Tribulation Phase. That way, we’ll have a better chance. Then we can act together, attack the Senior Sister, and succeed in one fell swoop!”
“By then, those with grievances can seek revenge, and those wronged can seek justice. Wouldn’t that be better?”
The little Medicine Kings thought highly of him, “We thought you were slightly less intelligent than us, but you have such a meticulous plan. It seems our intelligence is on par!”
Having a common enemy, Lu Yang and the little Medicine Kings quickly bonded, shouting and boasting about defeating the female demon.
With Lu Yang joining them, their group was like a tiger that had grown wings, confident of easy victory.
At the entrance of the medicine garden, Old Ba sighed deeply as he watched Lu Yang’s inspiring plan through a water mirror.
Yunzhi had specifically instructed him to keep an eye on Lu Yang’s movements in the garden, to prevent any accidents, and to inform her immediately if anything unusual happened.
Now, was this situation considered unusual? If he really told Yunzhi, even if it wasn’t unusual, there might be some accidents.
“Why can’t the young people of today be trouble-free?”
…
“Having said so much, I haven’t shown you the art I’m capable of.” Lu Yang warmed up and displayed the art of “Shrinking Earth.” He posed as if diving and jumped straight into the ground.
The Tree King and Yunzhi reacted almost identically, amazed at what they saw. Despite living for so long, the Tree King had never seen such an art.
From the surface, it looked like a space-time art like Shrinking Earth into Inches, but in practice, it resembled the Five Elements arts.
So young and yet able to perform an art never seen before, truly a genius in arts.
Now, Lu Yang used “Shrinking Earth” adeptly, mastering various swimming styles like breaststroke, butterfly stroke, and freestyle.
Lu Yang continued to perform his art of “Shrinking Earth,” with movements so fluid and adept that it almost gave the illusion that the earth was water. He swam through the ground effortlessly, using various swimming styles, occasionally diving in and out of the earth with ease.
The Qilin Undying Herb and the Time’s End Flower, having finished their quarrel, along with the Ginseng Child and the Three-Leaf Star Grass, recounted Lu Yang’s tragic experiences under the clutches of the “female demon.” They were all moved and excited by his story.
“We finally have a plant insider among the humans!” exclaimed the little Medicine Kings.
The four little Medicine Kings sat on the trunk of the Tree King, clapping their hands, impressed by Lu Yang’s prowess.
Lu Yang, in an attempt to show off, leaped high into the air with his legs outstretched and arms wide open in a cross position. He spun around 3600 degrees in mid-air, but upon landing, he lost his balance and fell face-first to the ground — he got dizzy from the spinning.
His attempt to impress failed.
The little Medicine Kings quickly scrambled to lift Lu Yang back up. Such injuries were minor for a Foundation Establishment cultivator and would heal quickly.
“The little Medicine Kings saw that Lu Yang could indeed loosen the soil, so they took out a map of the medicine garden and instructed him to burrow in a specific order.
“This area’s plants have very deep roots, extending down to three meters, so be careful not to touch them and cause any misunderstandings. I suggest you burrow between three to five meters deep, which is the safe zone.”
“For other areas, the roots are between half a meter to two meters deep. Just dig below two meters.”
Lu Yang asked curiously, “What happens if I touch the roots?”
The Ginseng Child said seriously, “We will think you have a foot fetish.”
“???”
The Flower of Time’s End interjected, “Your human race has many perverts who like to chew on our plant ‘feet’ while drinking alcohol, claiming it’s tasty and good for drinking. They even cultivate us on a large scale for this purpose.”
“What plant are you talking about?”
“Peanuts.”
Lu Yang couldn’t quite keep up with the little Medicine Kings’ train of thought.
Fortunately, he didn’t dwell too much on this issue and began to follow the route provided by the Ginseng Child.
The Ginseng Child, bored of watching the earthworm couple burrow, found it amusing to watch a human do it. They all followed closely behind Lu Yang.
Although the little Medicine Kings also had the ability to burrow, their method involved merging with the soil, quite different from Lu Yang’s way of displacing the earth.
The soil where Lu Yang passed became soft, which was just right for the little Medicine Kings.
The Tree King watched the little Medicine Kings playing joyously and sighed. Being a tree, it couldn’t burrow.
It looked up at the sun, feeling its harshness, and sighed again, “Why am I so tall? I can’t even find a shady spot.”
The Tree King felt the world was full of malice towards it.
The little Medicine Kings played behind Lu Yang all day. On the way back, they were still frolicking and laughing, “Let’s heat some water for a bath!”
The Tree King had prepared a barrel full of water, drawn from the stream used to irrigate the plants.
A bright light emerged from the abdomen of the Kirin Undying Herb and moved up to its mouth, where it spat out Kirin’s true fire.
The Kirin Undying Herb, resembling a real kirin, explained why ancient people were convinced they had seen a kirin upon encountering it.
The temperature of Kirin’s true fire was extremely high, boiling the water in the blink of an eye.
The little Medicine Kings jumped in one after another, floating and drifting with their eyes closed.
Lu Yang found this scene eerily familiar, reminiscent of a scene in a kitchen.
He remembered now – this was called medicinal cuisine.
However, he had never seen ingredients voluntarily jump into the pot before.
Soon, a fragrance spread through the air, invigorating Lu Yang and even seeming to enhance his cultivation.
“Indeed, as Medicine Kings, their medicinal potency is truly terrifying.”
Lu Yang watched the little Medicine Kings frolicking in the water, smiling helplessly.
He recalled his Senior Sister saying that immortality was a poison, an unbearable pain that only those with non-human characteristics could endure.
The little Medicine Kings, having experienced endless years and witnessed countless historical events, remained alive while those recorded in history had long since passed away.
Perhaps only a childlike nature allowed the little Medicine Kings to live so long without breaking down.
They were just too easily deceived.
