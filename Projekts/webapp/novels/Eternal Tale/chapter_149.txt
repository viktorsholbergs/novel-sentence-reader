The next day, outside Yuxu City.
The road stretched long and far, and the setting sun painted the sky a fiery red.
Cultivators hurried along the road, even their spirit beasts quickening their pace.
At this time, a man and an ox were leisurely strolling towards Yuxu City, their manner relaxed and carefree.
Occasionally, they would stop and haggle with a Qi Refining stage cultivator carrying a Red Lightning Wolf, looking for a buyer.
A few hours later, at Qin Immortal Mountain, Chen Xun and the big black ox finally returned to their cave dwelling.
"Moo~" The big black ox called out as it rushed into the cave to start packing their belongings, not needing any instructions from Chen Xun.
"Hah! This kid shows a bit of the flair I had in my youth," Chen Xun laughed, looking around at the surroundings. Despite feeling sentimental, he knew they had to leave. Even the slightest risk was too great to take.
The Tianwu Sect was backed by the Canghai Immortal Sect. Even if Liu Yuan kept silent, the disciples would eventually confess, and they would be found out.
Chen Xun looked up at the plaque on the cave and smiled as he waved his hand and stored it in his bag.
Boom...
"Old Ox, are we at war? Why the rush?!" Chen Xun frowned as the cave echoed with the sounds of crashing and banging. "I’ll have to step in."
He walked inside and started packing with the big black ox.
Another day and night passed. They went to their talisman shop and packed everything up, leaving nothing behind.
The shop still had a rental term, but they didn't care about that for now.
They walked out of the shop and gently closed the door.
Two Crane Spirit Trees swayed in the wind, their rustling leaves sounding like they were bidding farewell to their two friends.
There were still a few Qi Refining stage cultivators walking along the street, who only glanced at them briefly.
"Moo~"
The big black ox was once again loaded with pots and pans, wearing a slightly worn straw hat.
It grinned, time had passed, but their leader was still as majestic, and their old friends still endured.
Chen Xun smiled too, wearing a straw hat, and still carrying the three first-crafted mountain-opening axes.
"Let's go, brother." Chen Xun gently brushed his hand over the pots and pans hanging from the big black ox, his eyes filled with deep emotion. He suddenly shouted, "Off to wander!"
"Moo moo!!"
The big black ox roared, pressing tightly against Chen Xun. Chen Xun hugged its head and slowly walked out of the city without any hesitation.
People bustled about on the streets, but the two figures wove through the crowd with ease, carefree and unrestrained as ever.
They had arrived with nothing and were leaving with many gains.
Today, the sun was bright, the sky clear. What a perfect day for a journey.
…
Back in Qian Nation, at the Canghai Immortal Sect, the mountain range filled with spiritual energy, spirit-gathering formations covered the main peaks, and rays of rainbows often shot into the sky.
On the peaks, numerous disciples sat with solemn expressions, bowing in respect as Golden Core cultivators lectured them.
Flying boats occasionally passed between the peaks, carrying dozens of disciples, much faster than sword flying. Far in the sky, spirit beasts flew and circled, painting a prosperous scene that ordinary major sects couldn't match.
At this time, in a scenic spot filled with spiritual energy and surrounded by formations, a young man sat at the pavilion, sipping tea. His hair was as black as night, flowing down.
The young man wore ink-colored robes, his eyes gleaming like stars, and a star mark on his brow added a touch of mystique.
It was Ancestor Ying Xing, one of the Nascent Soul elders of the Canghai Immortal Sect.
"Ancestor." A middle-aged Golden Core cultivator approached the pavilion respectfully. "A few days ago, outside Yuxu City, the Tianwu Sect pursued members of the Five Elements Sect and was completely wiped out."
"Oh?" Ying Xing responded indifferently, his gaze still on the lake.
"According to the disciples of the Five Elements Sect who were present, a mysterious figure intervened, seemingly not human." The Golden Core cultivator bowed even lower. "The three Golden Core cultivators of the Tianwu Sect... were killed in an instant."
"Oh."
"Ancestor, the Tianwu Sect has sent people requesting our sect to thoroughly investigate this matter. They are also under pressure from the Five Elements Sect." The Golden Core cultivator glanced at Ying Xing, "Over a thousand disciples went to the Tianwu Sect to demand an explanation, even seven peak lords were mobilized..."
"Between sects, give and take is the rule of the cultivation world." Ying Xing remained calm, his voice steady, "If they dared to make the first move, they must bear the consequences. Our Canghai Sect does not shelter outsiders."
"Understood." A drop of cold sweat formed on the Golden Core cultivator's forehead. It seemed the Tianwu Sect would have to fend for themselves. "Ancestor, what about the mysterious person?"
"Foolish." A faint light flickered from the star mark on Ying Xing's forehead as he turned his deep gaze toward him, "Yichu, what do you think?"
"Ancestor, shouldn't such a person in the Qian Nation’s cultivation world be thoroughly investigated..." Yichu dared not look directly at Ying Xing, the overwhelming pressure was bone-chilling. "They might be connected to the Five Elements Sect."
"And what does that have to do with our Canghai Sect?"
"Huh?" Yichu was confused. Such a person surely hid many secrets, they should capture and interrogate them thoroughly. "Ancestor..."
In the presence of the ancestor, Yichu's mind seemed to falter. This mysterious person clearly saved the Five Elements Sect.
By using the Sect as leverage, he couldn't believe this person wouldn't appear. Then the ancestors of the Canghai Sect could deal with them easily.
"Heh." Ying Xing seemed to see through Yichu's thoughts, "Yichu, how many Nascent Soul cultivators are there in the Qian Nation’s cultivation world?"
"Ancestor, this disciple does not know..." Yichu bowed deeply, unsure why the ancestor was asking this.
"In my generation, there were quite a few Heaven Spiritual Roots and many prodigies, but only a few broke through to the Nascent Soul stage." He turned his gaze back to the lake, "Is it because the major sects lacked resources? What do you think, Yichu?"
Yichu, now able to face the ancestor directly, was indeed exceptional. However, he couldn't grasp the ancestor's meaning and remained silent.
"Please enlighten me, ancestor."
"Not perishing." Ying Xing softly uttered these three words, then smiled faintly, "Timing and assessing the situation are as important as spiritual roots, understand?"
Yichu felt like he had been struck by lightning, standing in a daze, a tingling sensation spread across his scalp.
"Such a person might already be in the Nascent Soul stage. Nascent Soul cultivators are very difficult to suppress, let alone kill." He gently raised his hand, the teacup nestled in his palm, "Moreover, this action was merely a way for that friend to settle karma, nothing more. Yichu, if we acted as you suggested, our Canghai Sect wouldn't have gotten so far today." Ying Xing patiently explained, "With such a mindset, your path in cultivation might be more tumultuous."
"Ancestor, this disciple has erred!" Yichu was shocked and bowed deeply, feeling enlightened, he realized he had almost faced a calamity. If that mysterious person acted unpredictably, he would be the first to die!
"Our preparation for the great cultivation world war among the Top Ten Sects took over a thousand years, and our swift victory was not just due to our cultivation levels." the man sighed softly, the excellent cultivation environment had perhaps softened the disciples' resolve, "Yichu, I have high hopes for you. Do not disappoint me."
"I will... heed the ancestor's teachings." Yichu, deeply grateful, bowed respectfully, "This disciple will now reject the Tianwu Sect's request."
"Go." Ying Xing's gaze remained deep and distant. The lake's surface suddenly rippled before returning to tranquility.
Two days later, although the Purple Cloud Immortal Sect did not stand with the Five Elements Sect, they suddenly released Wei Xun.
They merely said the lesson was enough and hoped he would not be so arrogant in the future.
The Five Elements Sect sent many disciples to personally receive him, expressing deep gratitude to the Purple Cloud Immortal Sect. Wei Xun also became much more subdued, not daring to cause trouble.
The Tianwu Sect, facing increased pressure due to Wei Xun's release, began preparing to cede territory. The impact brought by Chen Xun and the big black ox finally came to an end with the decisions of the two major sects.
