Second-Floor Private Room.
The woman in the purple dress dared not sit, respectfully standing to the side as she poured tea. "Senior, whatever you need, I will immediately prepare a list for you."
"I need a large quantity of profound talisman blanks." Chen Xun's expression was calm, his words carrying weight. "At least a business worth one million mid-grade spirit stones."
Upon hearing this, the woman in purple trembled, spilling a few drops of tea. Startled, she quickly recovered and bowed deeply in apology.
"It's fine, young lady. Go and ask your manager to speak with me." Chen Xun gently waved his hand. This young girl reminded him of his own inexperienced past. "I trust the Sansheng Pavilion's reputation."
"Thank you for your forgiveness, Senior."
The woman lowered her head respectfully. Cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage often had unpredictable tempers; even a small mistake could have cost her position at Sansheng Pavilion.
Letting out a quiet sigh of relief, she bowed again and slowly exited the room. A cultivator of such bearing naturally had the wealth to match.
Not long after, a veiled woman entered, followed by two elderly women, both early-stage Nascent Soul cultivators.
She wore a light, long, cyan dress; her brows were slender and elegant; and her eyes were bright like stars. Every movement exuded a refined and gentle grace.
But upon seeing Chen Xun in the room, she froze for a moment before speaking in surprise, "Senior, it's you!"
The two elderly women were equally shocked. When did the young lady meet such a figure? They hadn't heard of this before...
Chen Xun slowly lifted his head, a slight smile forming at the corner of his lips. He nodded lightly. "Young lady, it's you."
This was the one they had met while fishing in the past. He had even gifted her and another cultivator a spiritual herb, forming a bond of goodwill.
"Junior Yun Zheng greets Senior."
"Greetings, fellow cultivator."
Yun Zheng bowed gracefully, and the two elder women cupped their hands in respect. Their etiquette was impeccable and not the least bit presumptuous, making one feel at ease.
Chen Xun also rose and returned the gesture. "I've come this time to discuss a major business deal with Miss Yun."
He smiled faintly. It was rare to see arrogance in the younger generation of such powerful sects; instead, they were remarkably well-mannered.
"Please, Senior, have a seat."
"Please."
"I heard from the maid that you need Profound-grade talisman blanks worth a million mid-grade spirit stones."
Yun Zheng's voice was clear and pleasant, soothing to the ear. She began preparing tea on the table. "May I ask when you need them? This might take some time."
She dared not meet Chen Xun's gaze directly, keeping her eyes slightly lowered in a humble posture.
A million mid-grade spirit stones—such resources could help a Qi Refining cultivator with triple spiritual roots advance to the Nascent Soul stage. Her heart couldn't help but stir at the thought.
The two elder women exchanged a subtle glance, stepping back slightly, their eyes flashing with shock. What a grand transaction.
"The sooner, the better. I can pay a deposit of 300,000 mid-grade spirit stones upfront."
Chen Xun considered it. Crafting Profound-grade talisman blanks wasn’t difficult, but producing them in such quantity was another matter. "Additionally, there's another deal. I wonder if Sansheng Pavilion can handle it?"
Yun Zheng frowned slightly, showing no joy but rather sensing the pressure. She softly asked, "Senior trusts Sansheng Pavilion this much?"
"I've done my research. In Guiyi City, only you can handle such a large deal. Moreover..." Chen Xun trailed off, sipping his health-preserving tea. "With the support of three major merchant guilds, I trust you won't be shortsighted over 300,000 mid-grade spirit stones."
In this world, there were no formal contracts. If one were cheated, so be it.
But seeking revenge was equally simple. He could handle it himself, without relying on others.
Yun Zheng slightly lifted her head. The confidence this senior exuded wasn’t an act—it was absolute faith in his own strength.
Suddenly, she smiled. "Senior must be joking. May I ask what the other business deal entails?"
Chen Xun took out a list from his storage ring and casually glanced at the two elderly women. That single look made their hair stand on end as if some terrifying creature had locked its gaze on them!
Cold sweat trickled slowly down their foreheads, and they instinctively lowered their heads further. The room's atmosphere became oppressively heavy.
Yun Zheng’s eyes narrowed, immediately sensing something was off. This senior...
Her gaze quickly dropped to the paper, and her pupils shrank sharply. These were forbidden items for ordinary cultivators—a list of materials for constructing a large teleportation array!
"Senior... this seems rather improper."
"I'll pay more. Ten percent above market price."
"But—"
"Twenty percent."
"No—"
"Thirty percent."
"Sen—"
"Forty percent!"
"...Very well. This junior will give it a try."
Yun Zheng’s beautiful eyes widened slightly; even her veil fluttered softly. Her cheeks flushed faintly. If this deal succeeded, her family’s status could rise even further.
Her breathing quickened. The risks were significant, and she needed to carefully consult her family.
"Senior, may I ask for three months' time?"
"Take this voice-transmission jade slip. Activate it with your spiritual energy when the time comes." Chen Xun pulled out a jade slip from his storage ring and a storage pouch filled with spirit stones from his robe. "Then, Miss Yun, I await your good news."
As soon as he finished speaking, he stood up calmly, exuding the aura of someone who viewed spirit stones as mere dirt.
"Respectfully seeing Senior off."
"Respectfully seeing Fellow Daoist off!"
The two elderly women bowed with their heads lowered. That single glance had left an inexplicable shadow in their hearts—they were certainly no match for him.
After Chen Xun left, Yun Zheng remained seated, lost in thought. Plans were already forming in her mind. She didn’t intend to let the other two merchant families interfere in this matter.
Moments later, the paper on the table vanished into smoke as she instantly destroyed it.
"Miss... that fellow cultivator is not someone we can afford to offend."
"Miss, the matter of the large teleportation array must be kept secret. If someone pries too deeply and offends him, the consequences could be dire."
Both women grew visibly tense. The uses of a large teleportation array were far too many, especially given the vast distances it could bridge. They had no intention of being curious.
Yun Zheng nodded gently. "I will discuss this with my father to handle it properly. Compared to business, gaining this senior's friendship is far more important."
The two elderly women nodded firmly. This man was definitely not some evil cultivator. Forming a good relationship with him could only bring long-term benefits.
Sansheng Pavilion, First Floor
The big black ox and the small red creature were still earnestly browsing through cultivation goods for Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages, deeply engaged in some endless debate.
Even as Chen Xun stood right behind them, they didn’t notice—partly because he had deliberately concealed his presence, wanting to tease them a little.
Smack!
A sudden strike landed hard on the back of their heads!
Both the black ox and the small red creature were instantly enraged. Who dares lay hands on spirit beasts in this city? Is there no law left?!
Protected by Brother Xun, Little Red was furious. Whoever dared to bully it in the city must be dragged into the woods outside and given a good beating to taste the might of Brother Xun!
The big black ox also turned around in fury. Just because they were wandering on the first floor didn’t mean they were mere Qi Refining spirit beasts. Who dared start a fight in the city and disregard the authorities?!
