Qimu did not respond, but instead lowered his gaze to scan the battle formation below. The cold glint of the armor struck fear into his heart, and he realized the Easterners' intent. Feeling a sense of emptiness, he looked around, unsure of how many were hidden in the mist.
"The ancestor of the Li Family is said to have reached the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and is skilled in swordsmanship, nourished by pure spiritual qi of heaven and earth… If I were to flee now, I probably wouldn't get far..."
"My king! Allow me to deal with this Shamoli."
A few Qi Cultivators around him who were unaware of the dangers, eagerly volunteered, stepping forward with cupped fists. Only Zhong Yudai, an old minister left by his father Mu Jiaoman, remained silent, his hands trembling as he stared down at the troops below. Filled with fear, he lifted his head to look at Qimu but could not utter a single word.
"You... and you, go and test him together."
Qimu gave him a deep and meaningful look before calmly selecting two people, watching as two eager clan members stepped forward. He then called the old minister, Zhong Yudai, closer to him and transmitted his voice through mana.
"Shaman, Shamoli has colluded with the Easterners… and this time, they most likely want me dead. Take a troop westward and escort my son and two daughters out of the city. Find a place for them to live their lives and leave a legacy for me. Also, don't let them strive for more..."
Zhong Yudai's eyes reddened as he let out a shaky sigh, and descended. The two individuals beside Qimu exchanged glances, sensing that something was amiss. They wanted to ask out loud, but Qimu was staring at the skies with a grim expression, leaving them no room to speak.
Shamoli, seeing the two approaching, one a second heavenly layer and the other a third heavenly layer Qi Cultivator—both superior to him in cultivation— felt no fear, instead he was feeling triumphant. He raised his twin hammers and swung fiercely at one of them.
The Mount Yue Qi Cultivator, clad in animal bones and jade that rattled with a clinking sound, laughed heartily. However, he wore a fierce expression. Holding a bone spear imbued with mixed true essence, he thrust it toward Shamoli's hammers.
Shamoli's body surged with purple true essence with lightning flashing, which spread from his hands to his hammers. When the hammers collided with the bone spear, their true essences violently clashed, exploding into fine sparks of electricity.
The Mount Yue Qi Cultivator's smile immediately faded as he was struck by the heavy hammer. He retreated in shock, half of his body numbed by the impact. Fortunately, the stronger Qi Cultivator beside him stepped forward with a staff, blocking Shamoli's offense.
This gave him a moment to catch his breath, clashing with Shamoli a few times back and forth. Observing Samoli's formidable true essence, he quickly shouted, "My king, this man's techniques are strange… the two of us might not be able to hold him off!"
Seeing the true essence around Shamoli, Qimu grew even more certain of his speculation, silently gesturing with his hand. The remaining two people took to the wind, pressing together towards the enemy. Qimu remained still, caught in his own thoughts.
Shamoli must have received proper technique from the Easterners, serving as their lackey… Now, all I can do is delay and drag on this fight as long as possible to buy some time for my children.
The four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators pressed together, greatly increasing the pressure on Shamoli. Although his hammers swung fiercely, repelling and causing any bone spear or knife that touched them to explode, the four Qi Cultivators took turns engaging him in battle. This gave them time to dissipate the force of the lightning, and they seemed to be able to manage it without much difficulty.
Shamoli fought impressively, but internally he struggled, as his mana reserve was low. Although powerful, it could not last long; quick resolution was crucial. Seeing himself restrained by four opponents and the Li Family not intervening, he reluctantly shouted out loud for their assistance.
"F-F-Family... Head... save me!"
As soon as these words were spoken, a figure from the eastern army formation soared into the air. Sword in hand, it was gleaming and robust with true essence. He intervened among the four, swiftly knocking away two bone-made dharma artifacts. Casting a cautious glance at Qimu who remained uninvolved in the distance, he did not announce his name but silently engaged the enemies in battle with his sword.
This man was Chen Donghe.
Chen Donghe single-handedly faced the encirclement of four with great ease. He then said in a deep voice, "Brother Shamoli, go directly to confront Qimu… leave this to me."
Chen Donghe, now at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, practiced his family's authentic River One Qi Technique, which, as profound as rivers, was particularly effective against multiple opponents. Although unable to kill, he was able to at least hold his position under pressure without any issue.
Having married into the Li Family, he had received the Profound Water Sword Technique legacy. Although he had not yet developed sword qi, his combat prowess against these unrefined qi cultivators was overwhelmingly superior, making the four opponents struggle continuously. While the pressure was not as intense as what Shamoli had faced earlier, Chen Donghe's relentless and unyielding approach made it clear that he was far from being as drained as Shamoli appeared.
"Chen Donghe is indeed excellent, with considerable talent and diligence in training. He's especially strong in his foundational skills too!" Li Tongya praised from above.
Although Chen Donghe's swordsmanship was not as outstanding as compared to Yu Mujian's, it was still sufficient for combat, capable of holding his own against any adversary, ensuring no premature defeat.
"It's a pity that Jingtian has yet to have children… Chen Donghe spends too much time in seclusion. Fortunately, Yuanyun is with her, otherwise, she would be quite lonely…" Li Xuanfeng mumbled as he thought about his sister.
Li Tongya shook his head and whispered, "As a Qi Cultivator, it's rare for Chen Donghe to have children, and Jingtian being mortal makes it even more challenging."
As the two conversed, Shamoli had already broken free from the group, wielding his hammers and flying toward Qimu.
Qimu, watching Chen Donghe hold off the crowd alone, sighed in despair. He flew into the air with his sword and came face to face with the triumphant Shamoli who was fast approaching.
"Shamoli... do you know what you are doing?"
"What am I doing?" Samoli sneered fiercely as he repeated his brother's words, his hammers glowing with purple lightning as they struck down on Qimu's approaching sword, sparking a burst of scattered purple light.
"Who are you to judge? You don't even realize that this path that I have taken is the true salvation for Mount Yue!" he shouted.
"Y-Y-You, you... Such a waste of Father's instructions!" Qimu spat through gritted teeth. He was seething in rage.
Shamoli clashed with him in several exchanges, each move forceful and heavy, causing Qimu to retreat. His body went numb, and his true essence flowed unevenly, leaving him no match for Shamoli.
Upon hearing Qimu's words, Shamoli's sneer grew fiercer as he responded, "You dare mention him? What right did Mu Jiaoman have?! You were made the ruler, while I was left to face execution... You, as the eldest, had everything your way. Have you ever felt what I have endured?"
Qimu managed to hold his ground for the time it took an incense stick to burn, but it did not take long before he was drained of his true essence, his limbs growing powerless. At Shamoli's words, he paused, before bursting out into laughter.
"Now I understand, Shamoli! So, you care that much about Mu Jiaoman... Listen well..."
"No matter how glorious your future will be, no matter how well you govern Mount Yue, you'll always just be a dog to the Easterners!" Qimu growled as he stepped back several paces.
Without warning, he then twisted his sword to position it at his own neck. The sharp blade slid across his throat, drawing a line of blood. With a fierce look and a cold laugh, he held eye contact with his brother once more.
"In the underworld, my father and I will scorn you for your despicableness, mock your incompetence, ridicule you for being a lackey, deride you for deceiving yourself and others… and last of all, for not acting like how a son should!"
Shamoli trembled all over, feeling both shocked and furious.
"SILENCE!" he yelled.
Qimu, however, sneered coldly and closed his eyes. With a swift motion of the blade, his head quickly separated from his body. His head swung loosely as he fell, like a chicken being slaughtered.
Shamoli, looking as though he had been slapped, caught the head like a defeated dog. He merely glanced at it before the sight scorched his eyes, compelling him to look away. He lifted Qimu's head despondently and made a loud declaration with feigned pride.
"Qimu is dead… Those who surrender will not be killed."
The four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators looked at each other, before briefly hesitating and stopping their actions. Below them, the military formation descended into chaos, cries and screams mingling with the damp morning breeze.
Shamoli did not realize that his cheeks were slightly wet as he gazed at the majestic mountains and rivers shrouded in the pale white morning mist, muttering to himself, "His words... Should I have just resigned myself to death..? Should I have fled and lived a life in exile? Why... Why should I..."
Chen Donghe, riding the wind, approached and was slightly startled to see Shamoli holding Qimu's head in a daze, sprayed with blood yet seemingly oblivious to what was happening around him. He just stood there with tears streaming down his face.
Chen Donghe sighed softly and congratulated him.
"Congratulations… Great King!"
