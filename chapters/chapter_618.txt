Li Xuanfeng stepped out of the ancestral hall. The rain outside had lessened, but droplets still fell rhythmically onto the stone steps. His black-gold boots splashed through a shallow puddle of water collected at the threshold.
He glanced into the water, where his reflection gazed back—a face marked by age. His temples had turned white, his eyebrows thinned, and the lines of his face had blurred. His lips had grown thinner, and his deep-set eyes betrayed neither triumph nor joy but rather the weariness of one who had endured the pain of parting with life and death.
Li Xuanfeng was startled to realize how aged he had become. In that instant, he became aware of the toll taken by eighty years of struggle and hardship. Like most cultivators of the world, though his life expectancy placed him in his prime, the battles he had endured had left him prematurely weathered, unrecognizable from his youth.
He stepped into the main hall, where the threshold now seemed far higher than it had been in his younger years, rising all the way to his calves.
The juniors stood in rows along the sides. His elder brother, Li Xuanxuan, now a frail shadow of his former self, trembled as he stood at the highest position. Behind him stood a youth dressed in mourning robes, who was likely Li Ximing.
Further down stood Li Qinghong of the second branch, flanked by Li Xijun and Li Xicheng. Behind them, a scattered group of younger descendants waited. Li Yuexiang stood in a corner, accompanied by a hunched man dressed in black. A faint aura of demonic qi surrounded him, and he remained silent.
Li Xuanfeng immediately recognized the figure as a Hooked Serpent demon but refrained from commenting. Li Xuanxuan, his eyes brimming with tears, approached him and simply took his hand, saying, "Come, come."
In his youth, Li Xuanxuan had always ceded the spotlight to his younger brother whenever Li Xuanfeng was present, subtly stepping aside to give way to the more gifted sibling. Even now, he deferred, guiding his brother to the seat of honor.
The rest of the family bowed deeply and called out in unison, "Greetings to the Ancestor! Welcome home!"
Li Xuanfeng responded, "Rise."
Li Xuanfeng's gray eyes swept over the gathered family. He noted who met his gaze directly and who lowered their eyes in silence. He quickly discerned the state of the household. Having fought his way through rivers of blood in the southern border, his presence exuded a fearsome and commanding aura. His brief silence immediately drew the full attention of the room.
In a low voice, he began, "Yuanjiao perished in the grotto heaven. I have returned to bring his belongings home."
The assembled family remained silent, prepared for the news. Li Xuanxuan closed his eyes slowly, as though he had anticipated this outcome. Though the younger generation had tried to shield him from the truth, their expressions had long betrayed the reality of the situation.
Upon learning that only Li Xuanfeng had returned, the events that transpired within the grotto heaven became self-evident.
Li Xuanfeng could see the pain in his brother's face and chose not to dwell on it. Instead, he retrieved several jade slips from his storage pouch. Fixing his gaze on the gathering, he called out in a steady voice, "Li Wushao."
The black-clad youth dropped to his knees with a resounding thud, the sound echoing against the steady patter of rain outside. Li Xuanfeng narrowed his eyes slightly. Having slain countless demons, his mere glance struck terror into this Hooked Serpent, who now pressed his forehead firmly to the ground.
Li Xuanfeng said, "Li Wushao, Qinghong has spoken of your diligence, and Yuanjiao freed your spirituality before his passing. You are no longer bound to our family. If you have somewhere else to go, you may leave freely."
Li Wushao dared not say much. After all, the Li Family had treated him generously over the years, and as a loyal servant, his life within the family had been secure and comfortable. Returning to the Eastern Sea would only render him prey, a mere morsel for the dragon clans. Bowing deeply, he rasped, "Wushao is but a lowly demon, indebted to my late master's kindness. I would never dare to betray that bond."
Li Xuanfeng, uncertain about the rank of his family's demon-suppressing techniques, hesitated briefly. Before he could respond, a handsome young man stepped forward from the crowd. Carrying a sword on his back, his clear eyes were calm and resolute as he said respectfully, "Our family has rules for such matters. Why not leave this to Xijun for resolution?"
Li Xuanfeng nodded in agreement, then unrolled a series of jade slips in his hand. Speaking softly, he announced, "These three manuals were acquired from within the grotto heaven: Wei Radiant Celestial Pass Technique, Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique, and Azure Serpent's Return Technique. All are ancient techniques tied to our family. Except for the thunder technique, the others lack spiritual qi, but they can still be cultivated if the opportunity arises."
He handed over the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique with a glance at Li Qinghong. "As for this one, Qinghong, study it carefully."
Li Qinghong accepted it with a nod. Li Xuanfeng continued, "There are three Embryonic Breathing Realm manuals here as well. Two are Grade Four: Six Chapters Seeking Immortality and Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique. The last is a Grade Five Embryonic Breathing Realm manual, Insights of Taihua."
"A Grade Five technique!" The crowd murmured in astonishment.
Li Xuanfeng didn't pause, producing a deep golden halberd next. Its shaft curved like a crescent moon and was taller than an average man. "This is an artifact from ancient Bright Yang. The family may put it to use."
One by one, he laid out various rare spirit items. Finally, he brought forth a violet, circular jade talisman, presenting it with great solemnity. "This is a Purple Mansion Realm Talisman. When infused with mana, it can be activated. It shall be used to stabilize the family's fortune."
His gaze swept across the gathered faces. Seeing no trace of greed, his heart settled with some satisfaction. He gestured for Li Xuanxuan and said softly, "Elder brother, let us talk privately."
Li Xuanfeng hadn't seen his elder brother for decades. Though he'd returned this year, his responsibilities in the Eastern Sea meant he wouldn't be able to visit often. Faced with his brother now, he found himself at a loss for words.
Li Xuanxuan simply waved a hand. A faint, clear light emanated from several of his orifices, revealing the formation that the Hengzhu Dao Gate had placed upon him long ago. Accepting a jade box from Li Xuanfeng, he said hoarsely, "I shall see to burying Jiao'er."
He shuffled unsteadily down the steps. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng took a moment to stroll around the area. Despite the potent medicinal properties of the pills provided by Tu Longjian, his internal injuries had yet to fully heal. He decided to prioritize his recovery and went off to tend to his wounds.
At the same time, the two elders retreated to the back courtyard, while those in the main hall rose to their feet. Li Ximing cupped his fist and said, "The elixirs required by the clan this year will be available tomorrow. Send someone to retrieve them from my Alchemy Pavilion."
Leaving these words, he departed. Li Yuexiang was preparing to take her leave when Li Qinghong stopped her gently, saying, "Your elder brother is stationed in the sect. The branch line must have someone to speak for it."
Li Yuexiang paused, nodded, and stayed. The group then divided the techniques. The Grade Five Embryonic Breathing Realm technique, Insights of Taihua, was naturally set aside as a secret manual for the main family. As always, the Li Family treated outsiders with generosity. The Grade Four techniques, Six Chapters Seeking Immortality and Scaled Beasts Inquiry Technique, were allocated to the descendants of meritorious contributors.
As for ordinary external members and offshoot cultivators, they were already entitled to Grade Three Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques. This level of generosity was significant, rivaling what some other clans might reserve for their less-favored direct descendants.
Li Qinghong studied the Cloud-Thunder Inquiry Technique carefully, pondering over it for some time. In her estimation, it did not surpass the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique significantly, save for its lack of reproductive side effects. However, it did not reduce life force consumption much either.
"Strange… This seems to be a result of changes in the world, not a flaw in the technique itself." Li Qinghong's mastery of lightning techniques was already profound. With two ancient lightning manuals in hand, she quickly made her judgment. She murmured, "Still, it contains many insights worth referencing. The Eastern Sea is currently experiencing Falling Water Rising Storm. Once the family stabilizes, I will retreat to an offshore island for seclusion."
