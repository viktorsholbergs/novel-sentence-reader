【Tales of the Gods 30】The Triangular Pyramid God, Tsukutsuntstsun
* * *
This is the final chapter of Arc 26.
But at the same time… it’s also a continuation of Chapter 221.
If one were to briefly describe the room, it’s “the inside of a large, triangular pyramid-shaped tent.”
A triangular floor spreads out, and from there, walls extend diagonally towards the apex of the ceiling.
That’s what the room is like.
“GUUUUUH!! Nuuunuuuh! After all, this is the era of the triangular pyramid! And yet…!”
Floating in his Divine Realm, the Triangular Pyramid God, Tsukutsuntstsun, who is shaped like a triangular pyramid, was spinning rapidly, his anger evident!
In his fury, all four of Tsukutsuntstsun’s faces were dyed crimson, and his four vertices sharpened!
Placed before Tsukutsuntstsun is a miniature oasis.
A liquid crystal screen is embedded where the oasis’s spring should be.
This is Tsukutsuntstsun’s divine tool, which displays the scene of the lower world.
“Why, why, WHY!? Why are Temen and the others captured?!”
Displayed on the miniature oasis are Tsukutsuntstsun’s apostle, Temen, and his subordinates, the members of the Sunrise Triangle, imprisoned in a jail.
Yes… they messed up.
That’s why Tsukutsuntstsun is in a bad mood.
Temen and the others, following Tsukutsuntstsun’s oracle, tried to carve the Golden Pyramid into a triangular pyramid.
After long preparations, the time had finally come to fulfill that oracle.
It was good until then.
But while Tsukutsuntstsun was looking away for a bit, Temen and the others were captured and imprisoned!
It seems that the ones who did it were a group of archaeologists and adventurers who had a conflict with the Sunrise Triangle over the Golden Pyramid.
“I can’t forgive this! My own apostles, shaming me…!”
What’s further irritating Tsukutsuntstsun is Temen’s appearance.
Temen is currently almost naked, with only a triangular pyramid covering his groin.
It’s utterly indecent, and unbecoming of a proud servant of the triangular pyramid!
Although Tsukutsuntstsun, being a triangular pyramid, doesn’t understand human society very well, he understands that Temen currently looks like nothing more than a pervert.
“Hmph… I thought highly of him, since he could receive my oracles… but in the end, he’s just a human…!!”
Therefore, Tsukutsuntstsun decided to abandon Temen.
It seems that the Sunrise Triangle had been wanted for their past crimes, and they won’t escape severe punishment.
Further triangular pyramid activities will probably be impossible.
Tsukutsuntstsun doesn’t have the mercy to protect useless pawns.
Eliminate waste, and be smart.
The result is a triangular pyramid.
After all, this is the era of the triangular pyramid.
That’s Tsukutsuntstsun’s motto.
“Ahh, this is so unpleasant… I should change my mood a little…”
Here, Tsukutsuntstsun turned the dial on the side of the miniature oasis.
This divine tool not only displays the scene of the lower world, but also has various functions.
Gods can also post on bulletin boards for information exchange with this divine tool.
Tsukutsuntstsun skillfully operated the divine tool and opened the bulletin board site used by the gods.
There are various threads, where gods freely exchange opinions… but naturally, there are both popular and unpopular threads.
“‘After all, this is the era of the triangular pyramid’, ‘After all, this is the era of the triangular pyramid’, ‘After all, this is the era of the triangular pyramid’…”
Without caring about their popularity… and completely ignoring the context of the threads, Tsukutsuntstsun opened every thread he saw, and typed in his standard phrase, ‘After all, this is the era of the triangular pyramid’.
This is an enlightenment activity that Tsukutsuntstsun has been conducting for about 300 years.
The triangular pyramid is wonderful.
The triangular pyramid surpasses all.
It’s bait for those pitiful gods who can’t realize that fact, to lead them to the truth.
That is… the keyword, ‘After all, this is the era of the triangular pyramid’.
This phrase, caught by their eyes at a random moment, will eventually accumulate in the gods’ subconscious… and they will realize.
The truth.
And the world will change.
The world… will become triangular pyramids.
This is the groundwork for that.
Tsukutsuntstsun, convinced of his righteousness, has been diligently working on this for 300 years.
Of course, he doesn’t lack enemies.
“Some unseen being” silently deletes Tsukutsuntstsun’s comments.
This must be an act of obstruction by some evil being who fears that the world will become right.
But Tsukutsuntstsun won’t give up.
Even if 1000 of his comments are deleted, he’ll just post 1500 more.
The truth will eventually… prevail.
On this day too, Tsukutsuntstsun was absorbed in posting comments, tapping the keyboard with his apex—Tap, tap…
And that… was his downfall.
“Guhwah!?”
It was sudden.
Tsukutsuntstsun was suddenly hit on his side and rolled across the floor of his Divine Realm!
While he was absorbed in posting comments, someone had invaded his Divine Realm!
“Who…!?”
Tsukutsuntstsun, staggering, floated up.
And recognizing the figure of his attacker, he was astonished.
Because it was…!
“Wh… The Sphere God, Manmaal!? Why!?”
Perfectly round, no matter how you look at it!
A perfect sphere… the Shape God who governs spheres!
It was the Sphere God, Manmaal!
In Tsukutsuntstsun’s perception, Manmaal is a neutral and moderate Shape God.
He dislikes intervening in the gods’ disputes, and has always been a reliable mediator, leading to a “perfectly round, happy ending.”
Why would the Sphere God, Manmaal, attack him, the true triangular pyramid, Tsukutsuntstsun!?
Tsukutsuntstsun was confused and bewildered!
“Hohoho… ‘Why’, you ask?”
“Guhhaa!?”
The Sphere God, Manmaal, muttering that in an elegant, calm, motherly voice… charged into Tsukutsuntstsun again.
Tsukutsuntstsun was blown away and rolled across the floor of his Divine Realm!
“If I had to say… it’s to ‘shape the world into its correct form’. Hohoho…”
Looking down at Tsukutsuntstsun, rolling on the floor in pain, Manmaal chuckled, and then—
“‘The world is round’… that is the truth.”
—He declared haughtily!
And the next moment!
Another Shape God jumped out from behind Manmaal and landed before Tsukutsuntstsun.
“Uu, guh, uooh…”
That Shape God is groaning in pain…
Tsukutsuntstsun recognized that groan.
“You… don’t tell me, the Rectangular Parallelepiped God, Nagakushii!?”
Tsukutsuntstsun shouted, bewildered.
Because the Rectangular Parallelepiped God, Nagakushii, should be shaped like a rectangular prism.
And yet…
And yet, the Shape God before his eyes… is shaped like a cylinder!
What happened to Nagakushii!?
“Hohoho… He has become a follower of Maal, by Maal’s power!”
The Sphere God, Manmaal, happily bounced on the floor of the Divine Realm—Thud—causing it to vibrate, and rolled the cylindrical Rectangular Parallelepiped God, Nagakushii, onto his side!
“Triangular Pyramid God, Tsukutsuntstsun! I shall make you a follower of Maal as well! You should feel honored! Hohohohoho!”
Furthermore, the Sphere God, Manmaal, floating in the air, laughed loudly and glowed golden!
Releasing his immense divine power, he shouted!
“【Dimensional Transformation】!!!”
And the next moment, Nagakushii, who had been lying on his side, started spinning rapidly and charging towards Tsukutsuntstsun!
Tsukutsuntstsun, overwhelmed by Manmaal’s immense divine power and unable to move, couldn’t avoid the charge…!
“GUHAAAAAAAAAAAH!?”
He was crushed flat… by Nagakushii’s mass…!
Oh, poor Tsukutsuntstsun!
His body, which should have been a solid, three-dimensional figure, is now thinly stretched, a flat, two-dimensional figure!
In other words, he has been transformed into a mere triangle!
How cruel!!
“Hohoho! This isn’t the end… 【Reincarnation Axis】!!”
And furthermore!
Manmaal shot out a mysterious black rod, summoned from somewhere, at a speed exceeding the speed of sound!
Tsukutsuntstsun, now a two-dimensional figure, having lost most of his power, had no way to avoid the rod, like an arrow…!
“Guh… nuh… HAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!”
The black rod, without missing its target, pierced straight through Tsukutsuntstsun and stopped.
Tsukutsuntstsun is now pierced through a straight line from his apex to the midpoint of his base by the mysterious black rod.
He looks like a sinner, crucified for his sins!
By the way, Tsukutsuntstsun’s base is at a 90-degree angle to the mysterious black rod, and a symbol meaning ‘right angle’ has appeared at the intersection.
Oh… what humiliation!!
I can’t help but shed tears!!!
“Now, now, now… You will become a shape that Maal likes! Hohohohoho!”
But Manmaal’s tyranny isn’t over yet…!
Now, with her laughter in the background, Tsukutsuntstsun’s body… started spinning rapidly around the mysterious black rod piercing him!
“A-A-AAAAAHHH!?”
Spinning, spinning, spinning!
The agonizing pain of the hellish rotation assaults Tsukutsuntstsun!
“Aaah, aaah, aaaaaah…!!”
…It was well over an hour later that Tsukutsuntstsun was released from the rotation.
The mysterious black rod has disappeared from his body.
“Ah… ah…!?”
However, Tsukutsuntstsun, staggering, didn’t have the luxury of rejoicing at his release from the rotation.
What he felt first wasn’t a sense of relief, but a physical discomfort.
His body, which had been crushed flat, has returned to three dimensions…!?
But something’s wrong.
It’s clearly different from his previous body…!
“Hohoho. You’ve become quite a lovely shape.”
Manmaal, chuckling ominously, held out a round mirror to the confused, staggering Tsukutsuntstsun.
And what was reflected there is…!
…Tsukutsuntstsun’s figure… transformed into a cone… a three-dimensional figure with a circular base!
“Aaah… AAAAAAHHH!?”
“Hohoho, hohoho, hohohoho! Now you too are a follower of Maal.”
Manmaal laughed, looking at Tsukutsuntstsun, wailing as his identity crumbled.
“A ‘perfectly round, happy ending’… such a world will soon arrive. Under Maal’s rule…!”
And then, she muttered that coldly.
To be continued in Part 5 (final part).
This concludes Arc 26.
Since Emi had come to the desert, I wanted to write a desert episode, and that was the driving force behind this story.
That being said, Emi’s role this time was the “boss” of the episode…
I also think that a desert episode should depict more of the desert scenery, so that’s something to reflect on.
As I mentioned in the previous afterword, there’s a character who somehow faded out and disappeared from the story, but that was intentional.
The next arc is a very short story.
It’ll be over in no time, so please keep that in mind.
Thank you for always reading “The Reincarnated Extra”
Thanks to everyone reading it, I’m able to keep writing diligently.
I’m truly grateful.
I think I was born in a truly good era, where even non-professionals can publish the stories in their heads.
I would be happy if you continue to read my work.
Please wait patiently for the .
