Chen Xun chuckled and started sipping on his health-preserving tea.
"Friend, let's be straightforward here. If I were to buy this, it starts at one catty."
The Golden Core cultivator hesitated, realizing it was a deal worth two hundred thousand spirit stones.
"I'll say one more thing. We value the quality and reputation of Moyu Pavilion. Where else could we buy such an item?" Chen Xun directed this statement at the big black ox, still speaking with an air of indifference.
"Moo~" The big black ox was internally excited but maintained a calm exterior, learning from his elder.
"Friend, name your price."
"Ten thousand lower grade spirit stones per catty." Chen Xun raised his hand slowly, indicating 'one'.
"What?!" The Golden Core cultivator involuntarily exclaimed, his eyes widening with disbelief. Was this person trying to rob him?!
"Friend, are you kidding me?" He took a few steps back, frowning deeply.
"In that case, name your price." Chen Xun also frowned deeply. "We are sincere buyers, and we hope you can offer a fair price."
The Golden Core cultivator quickly composed himself, realizing that this person was somewhat difficult to deal with. However, he didn't want to miss out on such a significant deal.
"Nineteen thousand. That's the lowest price the Pavilion offers."
"That's too high. While I trust the quality of Moyu Pavilion, it's still significantly above market price."
"Seventeen thousand! If you're not satisfied, you'll have to look elsewhere."
"We also intend to purchase other items. I believe it will be a deal worth at least a hundred thousand spirit stones."
"Sixteen thousand. Friend, sixteen thousand!"
The Golden Core cultivator took a deep breath and looked at the calm figure opposite him, unable to discern what he was thinking.
Chen Xun chuckled, igniting hope in the Golden Core cultivator's heart. Little did he know that the next words from Chen Xun would be:
"Impossible, friend. You're trying to frame me."
The Golden Core cultivator seemed to be thrown off balance by Chen Xun's words, and the two of them began to argue vehemently, spitting saliva as they went back and forth.
Eventually, they shook hands and reached an agreement. The price was lowered to fifteen thousand, and true to his word, Chen Xun bought many other materials as well.
For the Golden Core cultivator, it was indeed a significant deal, mostly at the lowest price. Afterwards, he personally escorted Chen Xun out of the Pavilion.
He watched the two figures from afar, sighing inwardly at the old fox. Shaking his head, he walked back.
On the way home, Chen Xun and the big black ox used their body techniques continuously, weaving through the streets and alleys, familiar with every corner of the city.
They traversed through various streets and then disappeared into the crowd, returning home safely.
In the Yellow-grade Cave Mansion, Chen Xun stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze deep, while the big black ox prostrated in front, raising his hooves above his head, with a look of piety in his eyes.
"Old Ox, take this item. From now on, you won't be just an ordinary ox."
Chen Xun squeezed the storage bag and placed it in the big black ox's hooves, speaking solemnly, "From now on... you're the Big Black Array Formation Ox!"
Somewhat hastily, the big black ox widened his eyes, filled with disbelief. "Moo?!!"
"Well, for now." Chen Xun coughed lightly, unable to come up with a more cultured phrase. "These array formation materials are worth three hundred thousand lower grade spirit stones; I hope you'll cherish them and not disappoint me."
With that said, Chen Xun turned around and raised his head to look at the sky at a 45-degree angle. The surrounding wind and sand picked up, clearly indicating the use of spiritual energy.
"Moo~~!!"
The big black ox kowtowed, tears streaming down its face in gratitude. In this world, there was no one better to it than its elder brother.
â€œOld Ox, go." Chen Xun sighed deeply, still not turning around, his figure towering.
"Moo moo!" The big black ox, filled with determination, rose abruptly, and ran towards the beast chamber.
Chen Xun watched as the big black ox left, then slowly walked to the edge of the cave wall, his body gradually sliding down.
He felt like crying but had no tears left, life held no more joy for him. The aftermath of spending six hundred thousand spirit stones was finally hitting him.
"Damn it..."
Chen Xun placed a hand over his heart and looked up at the sky, but the tears refused to fall.
After taking two days to clear his mind of all distractions, he finally began his cultivation plan in earnest.
The big black ox had already begun, and the beast chamber was constantly filled with the brilliance of spiritual energy, with abnormal fluctuations of energy emanating from within. Occasionally, there would be the sound of the ox's loud mooing.
Chen Xun also entered the closed-door cultivation chamber and began condensing his spiritual energy. This was the final step.
The closed-door cultivation chamber was filled with the roaring sound of spiritual energy. Chen Xun was already seated in meditation with his eyes closed, and colorful chains of spiritual energy extended outward from him.
The invisible and intangible spiritual energy around suddenly became solemn, as if covered by an extremely strong pressure.
The five golden cores in Chen Xun's body spun faster and faster, emitting a divine aura.
The power seemed to be developing in an unpredictable direction; even the surrounding spiritual energy was subjected to intense pressure.
Boom!
Occasionally, there would be a rumble from the ground in the cave mansion, prompting the big black ox to quickly set up formations in the beast chamber, which made it feel much better.
They didn't dare to cultivate the auxiliary techniques together because they couldn't sense the changes outside and had to remain vigilant to deal with various unexpected situations.
The man was cultivating the auxiliary techniques while the ox was studying the formation diagrams, and this was how their days passed one by one.
Time was the only capital for the cultivator of longevity. Spring came and went, and twenty years had passed.
The big black ox had already run far outside the cave mansion, revealing its true form. It looked solemnly towards the cave mansion.
Boom!
Boom!
The spiritual energy in the air emitted a continuous rumble, as if stagnant, and was then forcibly suppressed. The energy in the sky and earth around the cave mansion suddenly became thin. It was a terrifying feeling...
The big black ox kept exhaling low breaths, feeling an extremely strong pressure, as if the flow rate of its energy was slowing down, becoming sluggish.
"Moo~" The big black ox felt empty inside, not having experienced such a feeling for a long time.
It remembered this feeling from the time in Five Elements Sect when it saw a Golden Core cultivator during the Qi Refining stage. That feeling of invincibility hadn't been forgotten even now. It took twenty years to condense the spiritual energy in the Golden Core stage!
The sound of footsteps came from the cave mansion, and the spiritual energy seemed to be expelled, driven out of the mansion. Inside, there was a dazzling, five-colored light.
A figure gradually emerged, his ink-black hair fluttering, his face calm, but his aura deep as the sea. Five substantial chains of spiritual energy surrounded him.
The chains were as thick as clouds, constantly descending. This was the weight and scale of spiritual power. He exuded an extremely vast aura, surrounded by a sense of awe, enough to chill the soul.
The power solidified into substance around him, resonating with him, causing even the spiritual energy to retreat in fear.
