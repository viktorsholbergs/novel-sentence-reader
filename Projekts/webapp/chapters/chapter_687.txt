Xiao Yuansi carefully examined every detail and committed it to memory. On the other hand, Li Xijun only casually glanced over it as he awaited his own people to record the inscriptions. Looking around, he did not find the spells that Mu Moli had previously cast, so he asked about it.
Ju Wu answered, “That green-faced ghost was something Mu Moli developed on his own… He kept proper talismanic rituals and transformation techniques at the Foundation Establishment Realm strictly to himself. There was no way he would teach us that!”
Ju Wu had clearly studied at Mount Wu itself, and spoke with evident resentment, “He got his hands on celestial texts and wielded Purple Mansion Realm shamanic spells with ease. Back then, he alone overpowered Chi Wei, Zhang Tianyuan, and Qing Jifang, while we, on the other hand, didn’t even have a single Foundation Establishment Realm shamanic spell to use!”
It’s no wonder that after Duanmu Kui’s death, the Mount Wu crowd defected to Azure Pond overnight…
Li Xijun listened carefully. It became clear that Duanmu Kui had never truly treated the Mount Wu cultivators as disciples. As such, the Mount Wu crowd had long shared a silent grievance. If they had possessed the strength to resist him, it was entirely possible that some would have abandoned Mount Wu for Azure Pond while Duanmu Kui was still alive.
As they spoke, Xiao Yuansi had memorized all the inscriptions on the jade wall. He stepped forward and spoke softly, “Answers to a Beggar’s Questions Under the Mulberry Tree is likely a Grade Seven or higher scripture. Only a few secluded sects from grotto-heaven and the cultivation techniques of Mount Luoxia could compare to it, let alone its exceptional material quality.”
Once they reached the summit, they saw a jade platform with numerous pillars of varying heights. These were inscribed with formation patterns for gathering spiritual energy. It seemed to be a dedicated cultivation ground.
The jade pillars varied in height, with the tallest featuring a jade throne, seemingly arranged according to status. They found a jade pool in the center, its blood long dried into blackened traces. A skeleton lay within, grotesque and grim.
Xiao Yuansi halted momentarily before stepping forward. He located the second-tallest jade pillar and tapped it three times in a precise sequence. The pillar instantly started to radiate light, its formation patterns glowing in sequence before ejecting a stone tablet. Xiao Yuansi caught it gently, brushed his hand over its surface and wiped away the protective layer of magical light.
Noting the astonished expressions of those around him, Xiao Yuansi remained silent for a moment before speaking, “There was a shaman who was a close friend of my uncle, Xiao Chuchou. His name was Dilu Tianfu. He specialized in talisman arts and also dabbled in demonic cultivation. His strength was formidable.”
A pained and complicated expression flashed across his face at the mention of Xiao Chuchou. His fists clenched unconsciously, and his breath grew slightly heavier as he continued, “Some time ago, as his lifespan approached its end, he sought to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm. He rode the wind to my family, intending to entrust his affairs to us, only to learn that my uncle had long since passed away. So, he sought me out instead… He feared he would not survive his attempt to ascend and, having no heirs, left all his belongings behind. He also mentioned that he had hidden something in Mount Wu, which I have come to retrieve.”
When he saw Li Xijun nod in understanding, Xiao Yuansi handed the jade tablet to him and spoke softly, “You all examine this first. I will retrieve the rest.”
This is the reward.
Li Xijun accepted it with thanks, while Xiao Yuansi rode the wind toward a secluded part of the mountain. Meanwhile, Li Ximing gathered around to take a look at the jade tablet, which was engraved with an ancient secret technique.
Bone Carving Skin Exchange.
This secret technique recorded the Six Paths Blood Seeding Art, which required a certain level of cultivation to perform. The cultivator must capture a demonic beast alive and forcibly channel the demonic beast’s cultivation into themselves. This involved personally carving one’s bones and peeling one’s skin, then infusing their own body with the demonic beast’s blood and flesh, thereby absorbing its cultivation for personal use.
This technique required a demonic beast that shares a Dao resonance with the cultivator. Once it was completed, it allowed the user to assimilate the demonic beast’s cultivation, effectively possessing two Dao foundations within one body. This resulted in an immediate surge in power but, of course, permanently severed the possibility of breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm.
“So, this is a demonic technique of Diverse Mansion Unified Furnace.”
Both of them had keen eyes and quickly discerned the nature of this technique. It was merely another method of consuming another’s Dao foundation. Every sect had records of similar methods and several major devils during the Devil Plague had practiced it.
This technique was rarer in the mainland, but it was more common overseas, where cultivation techniques were spread more freely and with fewer taboos. Many Purple Mansion and Golden Core Realms cultivators practiced it. They usually practiced it by refining humans instead of demonic beasts, which yielded a higher success rate and a better integration with their Immortal Foundation.
Li Ximing, who harbored ambitions for the Purple Mansion Realm, glanced at it but found no interest. He silently stepped away and began examining the other jade pillars. Li Xijun, however, took the jade tablet, looked over it briefly, and read aloud, “During the process… one experiences the utmost pain in the world, nearly obliterating one’s consciousness. Once mastered, one may be influenced by demonic natures… which can lead to changes in temperament.”
Li Xijun immediately clicked his tongue in surprise. Cultivation manuals were always written with extreme conciseness, often omitting even the author’s name. For it to specifically mention ‘pain’ was already notable, let alone ‘the utmost pain in the world’. It was likely even more excruciating than the Molten Metal Cave, which was infamous for its agony-based cultivation.
“What a shame. Too many drawbacks… Otherwise, it could be useful…” said Li Xijun.
Li Xijun was genuinely considering it. Not everyone could be like Li Xuanfeng. If the family’s resources were pooled into producing just one Purple Mansion Realm cultivator or even simply an invincible Foundation Establishment protector, this technique could be an option.
This technique has too many flaws, but it is still a useful method. Our family should consider collecting similar ones, thought Li Xijun.
He silently continued to ponder as he transcribed the jade tablet. He had long since abandoned any hope for the Purple Mansion Realm and had no personal ambitions. As long as he could protect his elder brother, Li Ximing, and his grand-nephew, Li Zhouwei, he would feel fulfilled.
My path to the Purple Mansion Realm has already been severed, so be it. If it means creating an invincible Foundation Establishment Realm guardian like Ancestor Xuanfeng, then I alone can still support the family even if Ximing fails to break through.
Li Ximing did not notice this, but Kongheng, who knew Li Xijun well, saw it clearly. He guessed at Li Xijun’s thoughts and mused to himself, I’ve heard that Li Yuanyun spent his life struggling in cultivation and died destitute at the border towns. He was the most neglected of his family… Yet somehow, his line produced the brilliant Xijun brothers. How interesting…
As everyone remained lost in thought, Xiao Yuansi drifted back with an elated expression. It seemed he had gained much. There was even a trace of a smile on his face.
“Senior!” said Li Xijun as he returned the jade tablet. Xiao Yuansi glanced at it, stored it away without much thought and instead asked, “Xijun, does your esteemed family have intentions of unifying Moongaze Lake?”
As soon as these words left his mouth, Li Ximing appeared slightly awkward, while Li Xijun fell silent in contemplation. The atmosphere cooled instantly. Sensing the tension, Kongheng subtly stepped away, closed his eyes and began chanting scriptures.
