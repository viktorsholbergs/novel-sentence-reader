"Old Ox, we're out of spirit stones. Let's just watch. After the auction ends, we'll go earn some," Chen Xun said with strong excitement. "With so many cultivators at this centennial event, it's a great opportunity to make a fortune."
"Moo!" The big black ox leaned closer to Chen Xun again. Both of them held their teacups, drinking through straws. It felt a bit dry in its throat.
They began to act as spectators, various rare treasures appearing on the auction platform one by one, continuously stimulating their nerves with their prices.
Towards the end, items used in the Nascent Soul stage appeared, and bidding began using medium-grade spirit stones, leaving Chen Xun and the big black ox dumbfounded.
They had never seen medium-grade spirit stones before, but they had long heard of their name.
Medium-grade spirit stones naturally possessed elemental attributes, with their purity being a hundred times that of low-grade spirit stones. Even during breakthroughs, there would be a slight bonus effect.
Listening to the bidding of the major sects in the room, Chen Xun and the big black ox trembled slightly.
Even if they sold everything they owned, it wouldn't be worth so many medium-grade spirit stones. A spiritual medicine for the Nascent Soul stage, which sold for three thousand medium-grade spirit stones...
And the competition was extremely intense. The old man's face was already flushed, and his voice was trembling slightly.
Chen Xun couldn't help but be amazed. If a Golden Core cultivator really competed with those Nascent Soul old ancestors, he estimated that they would be taken away for serious talk after the auction ended.
"These big shots in the cultivation world are really rich," Chen Xun sighed, his eyes somewhat absent-minded. "Old Ox, I guess most of the wealth in our cultivation world is in their hands."
"Moo~" The big black ox snorted, not understanding Chen Xun's meaning.
Chen Xun's gaze became increasingly profound, making it impossible for anyone to see what he was thinking. He just picked up his water cup and took a sip.
"Moo? Moo moo?"
"No problem."
A calm voice sounded, and the big black ox looked at Chen Xun, letting out a low moo.
It didn't like Chen Xun's current demeanor. Even though it knew he was hiding many things from it, it still preferred his silly and happy appearance.
"Moo!" Suddenly, the big black ox nudged Chen Xun, grinning widely.
Boom! He was launched directly off his chair, and his water cup was knocked over. His face turned pale with shock.
"Damn it! My health tea!"
"Moo~~!"
"Black Ox, you're dead!!"
The two of them started fighting in the room. Since they couldn't afford the auction items anyway, even if they could afford them, they wouldn't dare to buy them.
In the end, the big black ox was subdued by Chen Xun using his incredible strength, and it sat obediently on the ground.
They started recording the items bid on by the Nascent Soul old ancestors again. Those might truly be unparalleled treasures from within and outside Qian Nation.
Although the memory of the Golden Core stage had greatly increased, Chen Xun still liked to write and draw in his notebook. For the long-lived, any recorded experience was precious.
After a day and night, the final item finally appeared amidst the anticipation of the crowd!
"A Nascent Nurturing Pill, jointly provided by the Top Ten Sects, and refined by the Grandmaster of Pill Refinement!"
The old man took a deep breath, forcefully suppressing his greed. "This is an unparalleled elixir. Although it is of low grade, it can increase the success rate of forming the Nascent Soul by twenty percent!"
In each room, whether it was a Golden Core cultivator or a Nascent Soul old ancestor, their storage rings were already placed on the table.
At the Qian Nation Event, the finale of the first auction was a low-grade Nascent Nurturing Pill, with each of the Top Ten Sects offering one as a gesture of sincerity to high-level cultivators from various countries.
This is also the biggest reason why Yu Xu City can last for a long time, as everyone is giving face to each other.
Naturally, Nascent Soul cultivators need this item, and the descendants of Nascent Soul old ancestors also need it. Every hundred years, they fight violently, emptying their fortunes.
There are even situations where major sects use all their financial resources to compete for this item, which is a huge opportunity for them.
"Starting bid, five thousand medium-grade spirit stones, with each increment not less than one thousand medium-grade spirit stones."
The old man even began to amplify his voice with spiritual energy, the tail sound echoing in the hall. "Please, fellow cultivators, start bidding!"
As soon as the words fell, the bidding on the pillar kept jumping.
"Six thousand medium-grade spirit stones!"
"Eight thousand medium-grade spirit stones!"
"Ten thousand medium-grade spirit stones!"
In the room, Chen Xun and the big black ox were calmly drinking their health tea, so poor that they couldn't even afford the starting price set by others.
"Hehe, Old Ox, even legendary items like the Nascent Nurturing Pill are here. Quite interesting," Chen Xun said with unusual calmness, taking a sip of his health tea. He hissed, finding it too hot.
"Moo~" The big black ox seemed indifferent, not feeling envious at all, though tears of envy were streaming down its cheeks.
"I reckon many Golden Core stage sects have already used up their reserves," Chen Xun said, his gaze deepening. "If they fail to form the Nascent Soul, all the cultivation resources will fall into the hands of the top ten immortal sects."
"Moo?"
"The lower limit of the Southern Dipper Mountain is in the hands of the Top Ten Sects, and the upper limit of the Nascent Nurturing Pill is also in the hands of the Top Ten Sects. Old Ox, this is the reason why others are dominant."
"Moo~"
The big black ox nodded as if it understood, its eyes filled with thoughtful wisdom.
"It's already fifteen thousand medium-grade spirit stones. Old Ox, let's leave," Chen Xun said, picking up his water cup and getting up. This auction has greatly expanded his horizons and benefited him immensely.
"Moo!" The big black ox also stood up, grinning. They used to just play around.
After returning the jade plaque at the side door of Taigu Hall, the two figures quietly left, leaving the hall still filled with heated competition.
Outside the hall, the sky was clear, the golden sunlight dazzling and comforting, endless.
Chen Xun and the big black ox sighed lightly, then disappeared into the crowd of countless cultivators.
They began to sell five-hundred-year-old spirit herbs, various Foundation Building stage elixirs, and even went to small auctions to consign items.
But they never sold rare items. With the massive flow of people in Yu Xu City, it was like a vast sea of cultivators.
Chen Xun and the big black ox would stop after making a small profit each day, probably about 3,000 low-grade spirit stones...
Five days later, Yu Xu City was in complete uproar.
The discussions of cultivators filled the air, stirring up huge waves.
In the central city area, the championships officially began. Massive pillars stood tall in various arenas, towering several dozen meters high.
Countless rainbow lights shot up into the sky, creating a large defensive barrier to prevent the spiritual energy from affecting the surrounding area.
The Nascent Soul old ancestors sat far away on the floating observation platform in the western sky, their gaze condescendingly overlooking the entire giant city.
On the observation platform were the heads of the major sects and the leaders of various factions; their momentum was overwhelming.
And the prohibition of the airspace formation had no effect on such figures.
The championships, with their magnificent momentum, were the real highlight of the centennial event, where countless people would make a name for themselves and gain both fame and fortune.
The five major arenas were already packed with people, bustling with noise, all waiting for the protagonists to appear, their eyes filled with strong anticipation.
