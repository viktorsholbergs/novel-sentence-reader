Chapter 41: Departure
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Lu Yang once again arrived at the stall selling meat buns.
The seller was a senior sister, skilled in the art of dough fermentation, awakening, kneading, and shaping, her proficiency honed over countless hours.
She would pull the dough into small lumps, using her hands, wrists, arms, and torso… employing her whole body’s strength to knead the dough into the shape of buns.
Her movements seemed to convey a certain principle; it was not merely kneading dough but also a way to exercise body coordination.
The senior sister placed the bun blanks on the forging table, wielding a large hammer to fiercely beat them, producing loud clangs as sparks flew in all directions, burning small holes in the ground.
As the bun blanks were quenched, cold water instantly boiled, bubbling up, and soon a meat bun was ready.
Lu Yang was amazed, finding Bai Lian Peak truly innovative for seamlessly integrating culinary arts with weapon forging.
“Give me a meat bun.”
The cafeteria’s offerings were indeed affordable. Lu Yang encountered many eye-catching items here, and he would have bought them all if not for the limited contribution points.
…
The next morning, Lu Yang met up with two others at the gate of Dao Seeking Sect as arranged.
“We’ve been waiting for you.” Meng Jingzhou waved at Lu Yang, standing behind a carriage that was the same one that had taken them to Dao Seeking Sect, with the same old horse.
The only difference was that the third person had changed from the eldest sister Yunzhi to Barbarian Bone.
Barbarian Bone, who studied diligently, was learning even while waiting. His broad Confucian robe covered his muscles, making him indeed look like a tall scholar.
“Aren’t we taking the flying boat?” Lu Yang had prepared to take the flying boat, knowing his teleportation technique was convenient but not as fast as flying.
He temporarily gave up learning the teleportation technique to focus on mastering shorter distances and finer control.
Meng Jingzhou patted the carriage, proudly saying, “This carriage is a treasure, containing a spatial array. Though it feels slow to us inside, to outsiders, it’s as fast as a flying boat.”
Thinking about it, Meng Jingzhou’s journey from the imperial city to Dao Seeking Sect couldn’t have been made step by step by the old horse; it would take a year to reach Dao Seeking Sect that way.
The carriage used the array on the way to Dao Seeking Sect to speed up, only slowing down near the sect as a sign of respect.
What Lu Yang had seen before was the carriage already slowed down.
The three boarded the carriage, which was as spacious as ever. Only today did Lu Yang realize the true value of this carriage.
“By the way, where are we going? What’s the mission?”
“Eh, I haven’t told you? We’re going to a place called Qinghuai County. The specifics should be explained by Brother Barbarian Bone, as he found the mission.”
Barbarian Bone placed a bookmark in his book, closed it, and spoke deliberately.
“I heard of this task while on a mission. A merchant leader, knowledgeable about many things unknown to commoners, shared a story circulated among merchants, which seems credible.”
“Between Qinghuai County and Yanjiang County lies a vast range of mountains. Merchants wishing to cross must be led by local hunters.”
“A terrifying presence appeared in the forests, forcing hunters to abandon their livelihoods…”
…
Night fell, with overgrown branches blocking the moonlight, thunder roaring, and heavy rain pouring down, making the ground slippery and difficult to navigate.
Seven or eight people tied together with ropes to prevent slipping and getting lost.
With the sound of the rain, it would be hard to hear if someone fell.
Wearing raincoats and carrying baskets, they cautiously stepped, fearing to fall into pits.
The cold rain made them look disheveled. Looking up, the dense rain obscured their vision, so they followed the lead of the veteran hunter.
“Be careful, the mountain roads are slippery in the rain!”
“Don’t stop even if you’re tired. Push on; it’s harder to start again if we stop now!”
“I… I can’t… Help me! I’ve fallen!”
Someone slipped, falling towards the cliff without anything to hold onto.
Realizing someone was missing from the end of the rope, they stopped and frantically pulled the person up.
“Ah Yue, hold on tight, let’s pull together!”
“I have no strength left.” Ah Yue hung off the cliff, saved by the rope around his waist.
He was too exhausted and hungry to exert any effort, struggling to climb up.
The experienced hunter calmly directed the rescue, personally helping to pull the person up.
“Some of you hold onto the tree, don’t let us all fall! The rest, wrap the rope around your wrists, and on my count of three, pull!”
“Three, two, one, pull!”
“Three, two, one, pull!”
After much effort, they managed to pull Ah Yue up, leaving everyone too exhausted to stand.
The hunter didn’t relax. He checked Ah Yue for injuries, asking, “How did you fall? Did you feel someone push you?”
Ah Yue shook his head in confusion, not understanding why the hunter would ask such a question.
“What do you mean by that?” Qi Wu asked, sensing something was off in the hunter’s question.
The hunter pointed to a dilapidated temple ahead, “Let’s hurry. We’ll talk at the mountain god temple.”
The heavy rain wasn’t the right setting for discussions. Qi Wu nodded, encouraging everyone to reach the temple for shelter.
Arriving at the temple, they carelessly removed their raincoats, sat down, and quickly checked their belongings for water damage, which would mean a wasted journey.
“Good thing we wrapped them in waterproof cloth. Qi Brother is foresighted.”
The temple, while not in great condition, provided ample shelter. Three old, dusty statues of mountain gods stood in the center, surrounded by mud and dung. The plaques bearing the gods’ names were missing, offerings long consumed by wild animals, doors and windows broken, letting in the cold wind.
The merchants didn’t mind; any shelter from the rain was welcome.
Qi Wu offered some goods as tributes to the three mountain gods, thankful for the shelter provided by the temple.
The three statues, though crudely sculpted, were distinguishable: the central god wielded a gentleman’s sword with a righteous face, flanked by one in scholarly robes with a book and another emanating pure yang energy, indicating their respective literary and martial roles.
“May the mountain gods ensure our journey is safe.”
Qi Wu felt the statues possessed a certain liveliness, almost as if they were alive.
