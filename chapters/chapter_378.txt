Watching Li Jiman hurry out of the hall, Chen Mufeng's gaze swept across the remnants of melons and fruit as well as the gold and jade cups. He stepped forward, his eyes fixed on the highest seat at the end of the hall.
"The King of Mount Yue is nothing but a puppet," he murmured to himself while he subconsciously stepped up to the platform. He placed his slender hand on the seat with intricate engravings in silence.
The Chen Family had always been exceptionally talented. Chen Mufeng, now at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, surpassed all but those from the main family. He took great pride in this achievement.
"The main family's bloodline is undoubtedly noble, so I can't possibly compare to them. But Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming are just a few years older than me... Who among them can match my talents and background?"
He was young and at the peak of his ambition. His heart was brimming with boundless dreams, and he could only fix his gaze on the seat of power.
Lost in thought, Chen Mufeng was staring at the chair when a group of white-armored cultivators suddenly parted the curtain and entered.
One of them respectfully greeted, "Young Master, the preparations are done. Your orders...?"
Chen Mufeng quickly retracted his hand from the chair as though he had been electrocuted by it. He cleared his throat and responded quickly.
"Let's go then."

Meanwhile in Lijing Town…
Li Yuanping, dressed in brocade, was meticulously writing with a vermillion brush, and a stack of wooden slips was neatly arranged on his desk. He glanced up as Li Wen approached quickly and solemnly kneeled before him before reporting, "Family Head, the Jade Court Guards have seized control of Mount Yue… Li Jiman has traveled without rest and arrived in the town."
Li Yuanping hummed in response, stroking his chin in silent contemplation. Li Wen got up and stood guard below the platform. Shortly after, a commotion of footsteps heralded the arrival of a man bursting into the hall.
This man, with a slightly tanned complexion, clutched the hem of his lavish robe. He stepped forward and fell to his knees abruptly.
"Family Head, the Tian Family harbors great ambitions—they aim to monopolize Mount Yue and use it as their stronghold. If we yield it to them, I fear it could lead to significant troubles!" the man lamented.
"Jiman..?"
Li Yuanping frowned slightly and continued with displeasure in his voice, "The Tian Family are close relatives and loyal to the core... How can you say such a thing?!"
He looked slightly upset and pushed over the small pile of wooden slips on his desk. They fell on the ground with a loud clatter, tumbling right down in front of Li Jiman.
"The evidence of crimes committed by those on Mount Yue is here—witnesses and exhibits for each charge! What do you have to say about this then?" he asked coldly.
These incriminating pieces, diligently collected by the Clan Affairs Courtyard, were undeniable, but they were submitted in the name of the Tian Family. Although Li Jiman did not know this, he was aware of these prominent families' nature and did not dare examine the documents.
"Family Head! Although the Mount Yue tribes are violent and tyrannical, they serve as a crucial counterbalance to the Tian Family. If eradicated, the Tian Family will dominate, and the Mount Yue State will be at their mercy…. They could also breed disaster!" he pleaded.
"I've studied history! The Jiang Family of Moongaze Lake once depended on external families, which eventually led to their division into various factions and was overtaken by the Yu Family! This is a very important lesson to learn from..." he continued.
Li Yuanping looked at him silently, a little swayed.
"What do you suggest we do?" he asked.
"Family Head... please recall the Tian Family!" Li Jiman said in an outburst as he remained kneeling, his face flushed with urgency.
Li Yuanping let out a soft sigh, scanned the room, and commanded the two rows of guards, "You're all dismissed!"
As the room cleared in an orderly fashion, Li Yuanping let out another long sigh. He quickly descended the platform, helped Li Jiman to his feet, and spoke warmly.
"Jiman, what are you doing? You are a member of my Li Family; the Tian Family cannot compare to us!"
For a moment, Li Jiman was too stunned to respond, but then he heard Li Yuanping continue, "I'm aware that the Tian Family has deep roots in Mount Yue, and is restricting your freedom to act."
"But the tribes of Mount Yue are tyrannical, greedy, and vicious. If we don't remove them, how can Mount Yue ever fall into your hands?" he asked.
Li Jiman's expression was frozen for a long while before it finally gave way to a spark of realization.
"I see… I was far too incompetent to understand Family Head's foresight!" he exclaimed.
Li Yuanping sighed and took his hand, leading him up to the platform while speaking earnestly.
"The Tian Family, while well-connected within the clan, is innocent of any wrongdoing. If we don't sacrifice the Mount Yue tribes, we have no valid reason to transfer them," he explained.
Li Jiman nodded vigorously, then saw Li Yuanping smile.
"I have already issued the decree to transfer the Tian Family. Once this night passes, the wolves will perish, the tigers will migrate, and Mount Yue will be cleared from top to bottom. The honor of restoring it will be yours!"
Li Jiman was deeply moved, whispering softly and guiltily, "Family Head! You've planned everything for my benefit, yet I scarcely realized... I am truly ashamed!"
Li Yuanping shook his head and said, "I will place part of our family's cultivators under your command. You have studied the art of governance for over a decade. Raise the poor families, redistribute the land, protect the spirit fields, elevate the upper class... I'm sure you don't need further guidance from me, right?"
Confident and excited, Li Jiman quickly replied, "Yes! It's better to put those who are to be punished to good use by having them tend to the fields. Give me some time to train the cultivators. In less than five years, Mount Yue's productivity could increase by more than thirty percent!"
Delighted by Li Jiman's response, Li Yuanping offered a few words of encouragement. Li Jiman expressed his profound gratitude and departed, his head held high—a stark contrast to his earlier subdued arrival.
As he disappeared outside the hall, the smile on Li Yuanping's face slowly faded. Leaning back, he held his forehead with one hand and picked up his brush, lost in deep thought.
"Li Jiman is a clever man. The Tian Family's initiative was too abrupt, and the action to eradicate the other tribes was overly decisive… Sooner or later, he'll suspect me. Better to speak out first, dispel his doubts, and in doing so, also curry favor..." he mumbled to himself.
He gently set the brush aside and coughed a few times before noticing a person approaching. Clad in jade armor, the figure appeared steadfast and honest.
Kneeling on one knee, he reported in a deep voice, "Family Head, of the thirteen Mount Yue clans, two have been eradicated for their crimes. Nine are under custody, and the remaining two have been found innocent."
Li Yuanping nodded, appreciating the fact that the Mount Yue clans still knew how to moderate themselves which allowed two families to survive. He glanced toward the back where large chests and wooden boxes were stored and asked, "How is the harvest?"
Chen Mufeng listed several spirit items before replying, "The total value is thirty-five Spirit Stones, all accounted for here."
Li Yuanping instructed him to dispatch the items, and amidst a bout of coughing, he thought to himself, Once the guest cultivators are escorted to Cloud Crowned Peak, the family's finances will see improvements. The Wanling Blossom might bloom in a few more years, and things might get better."
