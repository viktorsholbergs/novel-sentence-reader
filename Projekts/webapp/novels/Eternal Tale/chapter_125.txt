The room was enveloped in a faint light curtain, surprisingly allowing a direct view of the auction platform outside, as if the field of vision had been infinitely magnified.
However, the specific situation outside the room could not be seen at all, indicating a well-executed privacy measure.
There were also soundproofing arrays around, and several jars of exotic flowers and herbs were scattered in the corners, filling the room with a light fragrance.
"Old Ox, this must be an array," Chen Xun said as he sat on the chair. There was a large table in the room, with a small booklet placed on it. "You see, the professionals are different from us."
"Moo," the big black ox snorted, moving around. This was definitely the effect of an array.
It kept looking at a red column about waist-high, which was definitely a refining object, and it even had an array attached to it.
There was a hint of excitement in the big black ox's eyes. It still didn't know how to add an array to a magic weapon.
The heritage and inheritance of the Top Ten Sects were indeed too powerful. What they were seeing now in the world of cultivation was just the tip of the iceberg, something that couldn't be learned in a few hundred or even thousands of years.
"Old Ox, we still have a lot to learn," Chen Xun said as he took out a cup of water, then started flipping through the booklet. "Here, there is also an introduction to the auction."
"Moo." After hearing this, the big black ox also ran over and looked at the contents with Chen Xun.
It was written that the auction did not accept bartering and did not accept defaults. All auction items would go to the highest bidder.
If someone bid recklessly and couldn't pay the spiritual stones in the end, the result would be the confiscation of all belongings and permanent blacklisting by the Virtual City. Without permission to enter the city, the Top Ten Sects would collectively execute them.
Seeing this, they both took a sharp breath. It was indeed a case of one's name and shadow. They continued reading down.
When the auction began, the array in the Taigu Hall would open, and the bids would be displayed on the red columns inside the rooms using spiritual energy.
After a successful auction, someone would come to collect the spiritual stones, and the items would be transported through the array.
"Old Ox, it's a teleportation array!" Chen Xun slapped the big black ox suddenly.
"Moo!" The big black ox was startled by the slap, snatched Chen Xun's water cup, and even licked the tea inside twice.
Chen Xun didn't care at all; his attention was still on the teleportation array.
"Old Ox, if you can set up a teleportation array in the future, who can stop us from escaping?!"
"Moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, reassuring him not to worry.
"It's okay; let's take a closer look. We'll buy some good things from the shop at Moyu Pavilion later."
Chen Xun smiled, his eyes filled with emotion. The future path was truly exciting.
"Old Ox, let's live well."
"Moo!" The big black ox was also full of joy in its heart, shouting loudly, following its big brother.
After that were some rules about the venue, such as not being allowed to move around casually, and so on.
Chen Xun and the big black ox quieted down, their eyes fixed on the auction platform, where several powerful Golden Core stage cultivators were already standing.
Half an hour later, a bell rang in the Taigu Hall, and the huge gates outside the main hall made a dull sound, officially closing. The auction grand event had begun!
Chen Xun held his water cup with a slightly flushed face, not knowing how many treasures would be inside. Several tens of thousands of lower-grade spiritual stones should be enough...
The big black ox stared outside without blinking, hoping for some array-related items.
On the auction platform, an old man dressed in a crane cloak had a calm gaze as he bowed to the various rooms, and his majestic voice echoed throughout Taigu Hall:
"The hundred-year auction grand event of my Qian Nation has officially begun. May all fellow Daoists and seniors have a rewarding experience."
The old man's voice continued to reverberate in the hall, and ten columns slowly rose from the auction platformâ€”a very solemn sight.
"The first item, Jade Spirit Scripture, can condense twenty percent of spiritual energy within the body for cultivators below the Golden Core stage, making it a rare auxiliary cultivation method in the cultivation world." The old man began to introduce in a calm and unhurried manner, "After this scripture was inspected, however, it was found to have a major drawback, which is that it will be difficult to break through to the next stage, with a decrease of twenty percent in success rate. The starting bid is 5,000 lower-grade spiritual stones, and each bid must not be less than 1,000 lower-grade spiritual stones."
As soon as his voice fell, there was a constant flicker of light on the auction platform, indicating that someone had already started bidding.
"Someone has already bid up to seven thousand. It seems that none of you want this item to be neglected," the old man said with a smile, only announcing the highest bid each time and not revealing which room made the bid. He also adjusted the atmosphere with his words.
"Oh? Someone has bid up to nine thousand spiritual stones! Indeed, the Jade Spirit Scripture can greatly enhance the combat power of cultivators of the same level."
"Eleven thousand spiritual stones; well done, my friend!"
A smile constantly flashed in the old man's eyes as he spoke calmly and confidently, showing his seasoned experience. It was unclear where the Top Ten Sects found such individuals.
Inside the room.
"Holy crap... Old Ox, at our level, bids are starting at tens of thousands of spiritual stones?!" Chen Xun and the big black ox both stood up unconsciously, their eyes filled with intense shock.
"Moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, indicating that this auxiliary cultivation method was quite suitable for them.
"Old Ox, don't panic. We still have over a hundred thousand spiritual stones," Chen Xun said, swallowing hard. But in the blink of an eye, the bid for the Jade Spirit Scripture had already risen to fifteen thousand spiritual stones, and there was no sign of stopping.
"Old Ox, let's go all out. Twenty thousand lower-grade spiritual stones!" Chen Xun slammed the water cup onto the table, his chest heaving slightly.
"Moo!"
The big black ox roared angrily, channeling spiritual energy directly into the column. If they didn't buy it now, they probably wouldn't have a chance at anything else later.
On the auction platform, the old man paced back and forth slowly, saying, "Hehe, someone has bid up to twenty thousand. Truly generous."
"Twenty-one thousand."
"Twenty-three thousand."
"Thirty thousand lower-grade spiritual stones! Does anyone else want to raise the bid?"
After the old man finished speaking, there was a hint of surprise in his eyes. Indeed, everything at this auction would fetch prices higher than the market value.
After a while, no one raised the bid anymore. Bang! With a final hammer strike, the item was sold.
Inside the room, Chen Xun was dumbfounded, sitting weakly in his chair. Despite the professionalism of this auction, the items were indeed expensive...
"Moo~" The big black ox let out a weak cry. The thirty thousand spiritual stones were their bid.
"This damn... there better not be any collusion..."
"Moo moo..."
Chen Xun and the big black ox looked at each other, a drop of cold sweat slowly running down their foreheads. Suddenly, the over one hundred thousand lower-grade spiritual stones didn't seem like enough.
At this moment, the prohibition in the room trembled slightly, and the soundproofing array opened a gap. It was someone from the Top Ten Sects coming to collect the spiritual stones.
"Elder." A male voice sounded outside the room.
Chen Xun quickly adjusted his state, his gaze calm, and said in a deep voice, "Come in."
With a wave of his hand, the jade token emitted a spiritual light, and a Foundation Establishment cultivator with an elegant bearing walked in.
"Elder, you can put the spiritual stones into the storage ring." The man bowed respectfully and took out the storage ring.
Chen Xun glanced at the big black ox from the corner of his eye, then turned his head away, not wanting to look.
"Moo~" The big black ox's storage bags kept falling, causing the man's pupils to dilate. Was this a Golden Core stage elder?
Finally, the thirty thousand lower-grade spiritual stones left them, and the man took out a sound transmission talisman from his sleeve, bowed, and left the room.
A five-colored light shone on the column, and the 'Jade Spirit Scripture' was sent over. Chen Xun then put it into his storage bag to study later.
