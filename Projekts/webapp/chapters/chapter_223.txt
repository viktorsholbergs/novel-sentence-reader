An Zheyan flew for a while, then landed and walked through the forest. He quickly cast an invisibility spell, and soon reached the Li Family's territory. After walking over ten li, he saw a stretch of houses, and a few dozen more li brought him within sight of Lijing Town.
Along the way, he observed the peaceful and secure life of the locals, who felt safe enough to leave their doors open at night. This observation rendered An Zheyan speechless.
Drawing closer to observe, he saw people laughing and chatting on the streets. An Zheyan walked around the streets twice and bought a bowl of wontons to eat.
In his life, An Zheyan had always enjoyed good food. Having a bowl of steaming hot wontons settle in his stomach eased his anxiety and sorrow considerably.
He took out a gourd of spirit wine from his storage pouch and drank half of it to bolster his courage. Then, with flushed cheeks, he stepped out of the crowd and approached a patrolling Li Family clan soldier.
"Go and inform your family head that the An Family..."
An Zheyan was about to say "An Zheyan from the An Family," but a wave of desolation washed over him, and he quickly changed his words.
"...A rogue cultivator, An Zheyan, has come to visit."
The clan soldier was slightly taken aback but his cupped fist and responded, "Please wait a moment, Senior."
He then hurried off, leaving An Zheyan standing by the wonton stall for a while. Two clan soldiers invited him to sit in the guest courtyard and An Zheyan nodded in agreement.
Well, I am a cultivator at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm… Even if Li Tongya is formidable, I can still die if I truly wish it. There's no need to stay and suffer, for there's nothing left in this world for me to cling to.
————
Since Li Tongya had entered seclusion, Li Xuanfeng had seldom secluded himself in his absence. He mostly kept an eye on family affairs, fearing that prolonged seclusion might lead to issues at home.
He was in the courtyard studying the Spirit Eye Perception when Li Xuanxuan hurried up with startling news.
"Brother Feng, something has happened in the Milin Prefecture!"
"What?"
Li Xuanfeng quickly put away the jade slip he was reading and looked up, somewhat startled. He then asked in a low voice, "The Yu Family's Milin Prefecture?"
"Exactly!" Li Xuanxuan nodded, looking somewhat pleased, and continued, "According to our people's intel, a geological upheaval struck the Milin Prefecture, leaving the entire prefecture in chaos. The market's grand formation, which is connected to the earth vein, was also shaken, affecting the entire spirit vein and decreasing the concentration of spiritual qi."
Li Xuanfeng listened with growing confusion, shaking his head and saying, "How is that possible?! The Yu Family's construction of the grand formation would surely have connected to the local earth vein to suppress the region. This formation, which locks space and restricts the land, can even hold off cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm. How could there be a problem with the earth veins beneath it that could cause such upheaval and leave everything in such disarray?"
Li Xuanxuan slapped his hand down and sat down abruptly. He then took the tea handed to him by a servant and exclaimed, "Indeed, it is ridiculous… Had I not sent people to investigate several times and see for themselves that Milin Prefecture indeed had collapsed walls and rivers of blood, I would never have believed such a thing."
Li Xuanfeng thought for a moment, then suddenly remembered what Li Tongya had said about the Fei Family being able to hold off the Yu Family for eight years.
"Fei Wangbai said he could hold off the Yu Family for eight years… it's likely their doing then! It's quite the bold move. Yu Mugao and Yu Xiaogui must be fuming with rage by now but are forced to swallow this bitter fruit…The Fei Family's tactics are probably just beginning," Li Xuanfeng said as a small grin crossed his face.
Li Xuanxuan chuckled, somewhat taking pleasure in the Yu Family's misfortune. He then commented, "Who would have thought that someone as gallant as Fei Wangbai would employ such unfathomable tactics? I'd reckon Fei Wangbai had secretly tampered with the earth veins of Milin Prefecture decades ago before the prefecture market was built. Since the disaster happened within the market's grand formation, there's no way it could be stopped."
"Indeed, Big Brother makes a good point."
Li Xuanfeng nodded and swept the area with his spiritual sense, then furrowed his brows suddenly.
"Brother Xuan, I have noticed that your cultivation has not progressed in the past six months, and you're still at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Why is that?" he asked, looking at his brother inquisitively.
Li Xuanxuan smiled awkwardly and explained, "I've been making rapid progress in talisman arts over the past six months though. I'm focusing all my energy on crafting talismans to help support the family's finances. On top of that, managing family affairs naturally slows down my cultivation pace..."
Li Xuanfeng shook his head. Now at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he could not help but remind his elder brother, "Techniques are for self-defense, but the Dao is what truly matters. You must be cautious, Big Brother."
Li Xuanxuan, however, dismissed his concern with a wave of his hand, evidently having considered this deeply. He set down his tea bowl before replying.
"I have indeed thought about it… With you and Second Uncle excelling in combat techniques, and my lack of aptitude in that area, I can only focus on the study of talismans. This will not only increase our family's income but also provide some protection for the younger generation."
He sighed softly and continued, "I am approaching forty years old, and there's no way I can break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before sixty. Even if our family obtained a second Essence Gathering Pill, it would only increase my chances by only five percent. Since I'm not destined for the Foundation Establishment Realm, I might as well delve deeper into talisman arts to enrich our family's legacy."
Li Xuanfeng was taken aback and found himself at a loss for words, only managing to sigh.
"If you've already made up your mind, then there is little more I can say..." he said softly.
Li Xuanxuan laughed it off lightly in an effort to comfort him.
"The family ultimately relies on you and Second Uncle… You are only thirty and already at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. You will surely make it before sixty!"
As they were talking and laughing, Li Xiewen hurried into the courtyard and cupped his fist, interrupting their lively conversation.
"Reporting to the family head! An Zheyan has come to visit!"
"An Zheyan?! He didn't die on Mount Huazhong..?"
The mention of this name made Li Xuanxuan slightly surprised. He exchanged a look with Li Xuanfeng, and both men smiled.
"Damn, it's a double blessing!" Li Xuanfeng remarked cheerfully.
"Bring him up," Li Xuanxuan instructed. With the grand formation's protection on this mountain and Li Xuanfeng's Golden Age Longbow, which was not just for show, they were not afraid of any tricks from a stray dog like An Zheyan.
"For this man to come to our family after losing his home... He must be seeking to ally with us to seek revenge against the Yu Family," Li Xuanxuan speculated in a low voice after Li Xiewen had left.
They waited for a while, but An Zheyan still had not arrived. Li Xuanxuan had already thought through many things. He solemnly remarked, "The news of An Jingming's breakthrough was leaked by An Zheyan himself. This man is indiscreet and unreliable. Now that he comes to us, we don't know if he harbors ulterior motives. Let's draw out whatever techniques and methods the An Family possesses from him first. He can serve as a tool for us, and we'll observe him closely for a while."
As Li Xuanfeng was about to respond, a man slowly stepped into the courtyard. He was slightly overweight, wearing a leather hat atop his head, his expression marked by unease.
Bowing respectfully, he greeted them, "An Zheyan greets the two… seniors."
An Zheyan was at his wits' end, reduced to greeting the two men who were as young as his own son, all while being at the mercy of the Li Family.
Li Xuanxuan did not want to leave him standing awkwardly and quickly stepped forward, his face full of feigned terror as he said, "What is going on, Senior?! You're making Xuanxuan nervous!"
An Zheyan's expression brightened significantly, even showing a trace of gratitude. His eyes reddened with emotion as he fought to find his words.
"I regret not following my son's advice to ally with your family against the Yu Family… Now, I find myself in this pitiful state! Truly, I have only myself to blame!" he cried out bitterly.
An Jingming had originally advised An Zheyan to cede Mount Huazhong and arrange a marriage with a daughter from the Li Family's main family, suggesting they support each other to resist the Yu Family.
However, An Zheyan—being greedy and miserly—was unwilling to cede Mount Huazhong. This forced An Jingming to find an alternative, ultimately leading to their current plight.
"Senior, you're too harsh on yourself!" Li Xuanxuan said with great respect, lowering his voice to ask, "But what of the An Family now?"
This question twisted painfully in An Zheyan's heart, and he replied tearfully, "It has been overtaken by my illegitimate brother and has become a vassal to the Yu Family... My poor son, he likely doesn't even have a place to be buried!"
Li Xuanxuan quickly consoled him.
"Senior, you are now a rogue cultivator, and like our Li Family, you bear deep grudges against the Yu Family. You must have come to our Li Family to join forces with us... Why not stay with us for a while?"
Li Xuanxuan's words were well chosen, and An Zheyan was deeply moved by them. Though grateful, he understood that once he agreed to such terms, he would likely have to take a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, thereby relinquishing the An Family's secret techniques and many legacies. With nothing left to lose, he found himself with no choice.
Recalling the words An Jingming had instructed before his death, An Zheyan's eyes reddened, and he thought to himself, Jingming told me to seek refuge with the Li Family before he died. He must have had his reason for saying this… I just need to obey! Now I can do nothing else but follow his wishes.
