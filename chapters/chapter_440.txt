"How is it not possible?"
Kong Yu's face darkened, gritting his teeth as he continued, "The ancestor's son was killed before him, yet in his confusion, he ended up playing a game with that boy about holding on for the duration of an incense stick! He even lost and became a laughingstock! Funny, isn't it?!"
Kong Yu laughed bitterly, then continued softly with a pained expression, "The people we sent out lost their minds and became fools to be consumed as mere fodder by the enemy. Ultimately, even our ancestor, who was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm, also fell to that boy. He desecrated our family's immortal mountain, dismantled the Kong Family, and eventually returned to the north."
"Where was Daoist Master Changxi?" Li Xuanxuan asked, his throat dry from listening to the story.
Kong Yu replied softly, "Daoist Master Changxi did eventually break through and return. However, within three years, our Kong Family was scattered and nicknamed the One Stick of Incense Clan. Terrified, Daoist Master Changxi relocated from Xu State, leading to the founding of Profound Peak Gate."
The story left Li Xuanxuan's back drenched in a cold sweat. He sighed as realization dawned upon him.
No wonder Profound Peak Gate is in its current state of decline—most of their cultivators have perished, and they have yet to recover from this incident...
Kong Yu continued with a sorrowful expression, "The disaster that befell my Kong Family is a tale of utter helplessness. I can only imagine how much despair my ancestor must have felt when faced with such calamity. This incident stirred up a sensation in Xu State, and the surviving clan members who scattered among various families were well-known."
Li Xuanxuan asked curiously, "Do you know the name of that person back then…?"
Kong Yu spread his hands and smiled wryly.
"A name? I dare not utter it."
Li Xuanxuan was momentarily at a loss. After hearing the story, he sensed that something was amiss.
"If you are so wary of offending him, why persist in publicizing this? It won't benefit your family. It might even save future generations by letting the matter be forgotten..." he commented carefully.
Li Xuanxuan thought to himself, Isn't spreading this story everywhere just sending a message to that person that the Kong Family is still resentful of what happened…?
Kong Yu gazed at him and replied, "I dare not comment, resent, or forget this matter. Even if I speak of it, I will tell the entire story—not for any other reason but to spread it far and wide, hoping to appease that person and ensure our survival."
"After all, it is a tale painstakingly crafted by that person. As long as the story is widely known, the Kong Family will stand as a monument to their efforts, and that person may be less inclined to see us perish."
"If even the villain of the story has forgotten this story, how can the audience still find it engaging?" Kong Yu added in a deep voice.
Li Family…
As the year drew to a close and snow began to fall, the day for collecting tributes approached.
Li Yuanping meticulously reviewed the records. The Li Family now governed five peaks and eighteen towns, supporting 320,000 people. With the additional 280,000 from Eastern Mount Yue, the total population reached 600,000.
This population growth was due to the efforts of the three brothers, Li Yuanxiu, Li Yuanjiao, and Li Yuanping, who had relocated people from the densely populated Lijing and Huaqian areas to the newly acquired Mount Huazhong and Yuting. Additionally, the devil plague had driven families on the eastern shore to seek refuge with the Li Family.
"600,000 people!"
The Li Family's wealth, with its five peaks, was second only to the fertile fields of Milin and far superior to the deep mountains and old forests of the Fei Family. Supporting 600,000 people was already at the limit of their capacity.
Despite having only a handful of Qi Cultivators, the Li Family boasted the largest number of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators among all the families. The establishment of the governance system overnight on the five peaks dramatically increased the number of registered Embryonic Breathing cultivators this year from nearly 200 to over 300.
Li Yuanping understood the dynamics well. Prominent families saw the financial benefits and quickly integrated their cultivators into the Li Family. Similarly, it also attracted other rogue cultivators to join.
"Money is certainly motivating!"
Li Yuanping sneered, his pale face reflecting his disdain.
The prominent families and external cultivators probably still keep more than half of their Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators to themselves, fearing that I, Li Yuanping, might cheat them!
He glanced over the lists and muttered, "Once you've registered… you'll no longer have a say!"
"Get everyone to come in!"
At his command, Dou Yi went to deliver the order.
A procession of cultivators soon entered, led by An Zheyan and Tian Zhongqing. The An and Tian families had made significant contributions, so they naturally took the lead, followed by representatives from the Chen, Xu, Ren, and other families.
Li Yuanping addressed the assembly, "The Tian Family made the greatest contribution to combating the devil plague this time. Tian Zhongqing, you will be assigned as the Peak Guardian of Mount Huaqian."
Tian Zhongqing was not surprised by Li Yuanping's decision.
Li Yuanping's administrative system had three key positions—Peak Manager, Peak Guardian, and Peak Overseer.
The Peak Overseer would be one of the direct descendants of the Li Family, responsible for overseeing the formation plate. This role did not require an exceptionally powerful member, as the main responsibility was to periodically inspect the formation plate. The rest of the time, the Peak Overseer could cultivate in peace.
The Peak Manager would be assigned to an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Their responsibilities included overseeing taxes, general affairs, and inspections. Additionally, about ten other Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators would assist the Peak Manager. Although it was a labor-intensive role, it was not a suitable position for Tian Zhongqing.
The Peak Guardian would be a Qi Cultivator responsible for guarding and defending against demons and devils. This role required the strongest cultivator but was also the most relaxed, making it an ideal position for Tian Zhongqing, who, at forty, was in his prime for enhancing his cultivation.
"Xu Gongming will be the Peak Guardian of Mount Yuting, Xu Shumu the Peak Manager of Mount Huazhong, Xu Gongyu the Peak Manager of Mount Wutu, and Shamoli will also be stationed on Mount Wutu as the Peak Guardian…"
Li Yuanping only promoted seasoned veterans and officials who had distinguished themselves during the devil plague. Each peak is now governed by one Qi Cultivator, three various unrefined Qi Cultivators, and dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. Most of these Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators were assigned to farming and other chores rather than remaining on the mountain.
With the major positions filled, Li Yuanping skipped the rest.
The other cultivators looked at him with anticipation, only to see him lower the document in his hand and say, "There's still a shortage of cultivators. Until the peaks are adequately staffed with Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, I will promote those who have shown merit."
Li Yuanping observed their bewildered expressions and smiled as he said, "There are only limited positions at each peak. Based on cultivation and merit, each position comes with dharma artifacts, elixirs, and cave dwellings, which are burdensome for the clan to provide."
At the mention of dharma artifacts and elixirs, the eyes of the guest cultivators, prominent families, and branches grew intense. In a world where devil cultivators were rampant, venturing out could be perilous. Hence, dharma artifacts and elixirs were highly coveted.
The Li Family's resources were scarce, and the cultivators under their rule were impoverished. Although the positions at the peaks came with dharma artifacts, these were expected to be returned upon resignation. Nevertheless, many other families lacked even a single dharma artifact.
Moreover, elixirs and cave dwellings were critical for cultivation. The opportunity to improve one's abilities and extend one's lifespan is hard to resist…
Noticing the greed and ambitions in everyone's eyes, Li Yuanping nodded and dismissed the assembly.
The Snake Demon Cave Dwelling is larger than I anticipated… The direct lineage won't have to worry about having a cave dwelling to cultivate. These caves on the mountain are surplus, the dharma artifacts are simply lying around. The only costs we have to worry about are clan stipends and elixirs…
Li Yuanping sighed, reviewed a few reports, and prepared to expand the Jade Court Guards and Clan Affairs Courtyard.
"Salary increases... Spirit Paddies, Spirit Stones, and elixirs… There's a shortage of everything. The spirit resources at the bottom of Moongaze Lake are simply too scarce! It would be ideal if we could gain access to Mount Dali freely..."
