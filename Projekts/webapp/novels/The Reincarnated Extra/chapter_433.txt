The Warrior and the Father
* * *
“TAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!”
Kobdacleva, swimming towards Kobdalian at tremendous speed, abruptly changed course just before colliding with him, and swung his hidden supernatural ability, 【Water Claws】, horizontally!
“Gah!!”
Kobdalian had just experienced the power of those 【Water Claws】 firsthand.
Despite being ‘claws made of water’, they were somehow incredibly sharp.
He was lucky that it missed his vitals earlier, but if those claws had gouged out his head, Kobdalian wouldn’t be alive now.
Naturally, Kobdalian was forced to dodge, enduring the pain from his wound, and jumped high into the air.
“Waaaait!!!”
Kobdacleva jumped up after him.
And towards Kobdalian, who was ascending while subtly changing course to the right and left, he swung his 【Water Claws】 one after another!
<<<Hehe! You’re wide open, Kobdalian… Ah!? Gyaaaaaaaaah!?>>>
A Black Kobu warrior tried to take advantage of the situation and jumped in, but this Kobudai wasn’t strong enough.
He was caught in the slash of the 【Water Claws】, cut into rings, and fell apart, raining down towards the ground…
<<<Tch! You’re in the way…>>>
<<<W-Wait, Kobdacleva-dono! What do you mean by revenge!?>>>
Kobdacleva muttered, irritated that the Black Kobu warrior had interrupted them, creating distance.
Kobdalian, on the other hand, was still trying to talk, breathing heavily.
He had trusted Kobdacleva, despite their short acquaintance.
And yet, he was betrayed.
His head was trying to understand…
…That Kobdacleva is an enemy.
But his heart wouldn’t accept it.
<<<’What do you mean’…? Don’t be ridiculous… You killed my son!!>>>
But those words, uttered in an attempt to start a dialogue, enraged Kobdacleva even further!
<<<What…? >>>
Kobdacleva, swinging his 【Water Claws】 wildly, roared at the bewildered Kobdalian!
Standing there was a single blue Kobudai, in a frenzy.
The intelligent and rational Clan Chief was nowhere to be found.
<<<My son! Was a kind child!!>>>
Kobdacleva swung his 【Water Claws】 from right to left.
Kobdalian avoided it by lowering his altitude.
<<<And yet, he said, ‘I’m not smart enough’, and gave up on becoming a Kobudai Sage, choosing the path of a Kobudai warrior! He said, ‘I’ll do my best for the village’, smiling shyly!>>>
Several slashes from the 【Water Claws】, left to right, top to bottom, horizontal, downward, attacked Kobdalian one after another…
Kobdalian distanced himself further and avoided them.
<<<He was a good boy… a good boy! And you… killed him! You killed my son… YOUUU KILLED HIIIM!!!>>>
<<<Just… wait! Wait a minute!!>>>
<<<Guh!?>>>
But Kobdalian isn’t just going to take it.
Kobdacleva’s attacks are all wide swings.
Although 【Water Claws】 is a fearsome weapon, Kobdacleva doesn’t seem to be using it very well.
Simply put, there are big openings.
Kobdalian took advantage of one of those openings, body-slammed Kobdacleva, and blew him away!
<<<I’ve been listening to you, dammit!! So your son was a Blue Kobu warrior, right!? Then, dying on the battlefield… is a warrior’s way!!>>>
The force of Kobdalian’s body slam was so great that Kobdacleva was slammed to the ground, spinning!
BOOM!!
The ground shook from the impact, and dust rose into the air.
But such an attack couldn’t stop Kobdacleva, and the Blue Kobudai, coughing, rose up to the same height as Kobdalian.
<<<Ha… Gah… ‘A warrior’s way’? Don’t be ridiculous… Don’t force your logic on me…!!>>>
And Kobdacleva…
<<<You think I can just accept… the charred remains of my son, who came back from the battlefield because of your logic!!!>>>
…Screamed with resentment!
<<<…!!!>>>
Those words shocked Kobdalian.
He was raised in the Red Kobu Tribe village, as a warrior.
He lived by a warrior’s logic.
He fought, brandishing a warrior’s logic.
But… but…
Kobdalian understood what Kobdacleva was saying.
Because it was…
…The natural way of thinking, that he, as a Kobudai, should have.
…Something he’s been desperately suppressing, pushing down deep inside his heart, with a warrior’s logic.
But…
Kobdalian glanced around.
The Red Kobu warriors are still fighting.
Naturally, outnumbered.
The situation is unfavorable.
One after another, even renowned warriors are falling…
Right beside him, the veteran warrior, Kobdaold, is lying on the ground, his mouth wide open.
He’s already dead.
Many other warriors are losing their ability to move.
He can’t allow any more casualties.
He is the Clan Chief.
He can’t lose.
For the sake of his tribe…
Therefore…
<<<We… have to settle this…>>>
Kobdalian took a deep breath, and let it out.
And then, looking straight at Kobdacleva, he made up his mind.
Kobdacleva is strong.
But he’s probably not a warrior.
He’s driven by a different logic than a warrior’s.
But Kobdalian…
…Has to force his unreasonable warrior’s logic on him… and win…
…For the Red Kobu Tribe!!
<<<UOOOOOOOOOHーーー!!>>>
Kobdalian and Kobdacleva…
…The two Clan Chiefs, who were glaring at each other… began to charge at each other… almost simultaneously.
Kobdacleva, swimming, prepared his extended 【Water Claws】, intending to slash Kobdalian as soon as they get close.
Kobdalian, on the other hand, activated 【Raging Flames】 again, charging while engulfed in flames.
In the sneak attack earlier, Kobdacleva’s 【Water Claws】 did pierce through his armor of 【Raging Flames】.
So…
…This time too, 【Water Claws】 has the advantage.
That’s what Kobdacleva thought when he started swimming.
But…
<<<Wh…!? >>>
Kobdacleva, seeing Kobdalian charging towards him, was surprised, his eyes widening!
Kobdalian is enveloped in 【Raging Flames】…
But the appearance of those 【Raging Flames】… is clearly different from before!
Specifically, the color.
Kobdalian, at this moment, was clad in… “blue” 【Raging Flames】!
This young, inexperienced Clan Chief of the Red Kobu Tribe…
Through his fight with Kobdacleva…
…Has truly… made up his mind.
About his way of being, as a Red Kobu warrior!
Whether that resolve is right or wrong…
…I’m not going to judge it here.
But that resolve… definitely made Kobdalian’s soul grow!
And with it, his supernatural ability!
…Awakened!!
<<<TAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!>>>
But Kobdacleva, although momentarily surprised, wasn’t intimidated!
He too, has already made up his mind.
Kobdacleva poured most of his mana into his 【Water Claws】, strengthening them, and swung them… with all his might… towards Kobdalian!
BOOM!!
【Water Claws】 and blue 【Raging Flames】 collided, and steam enveloped the surroundings of the two Clan Chiefs, like an explosion!
And then, a few moments later!
Something blazing broke through the steam, and was blown away!
BOOM!!
It crashed to the ground with a loud sound!
<<<A… gah…>>>
The one groaning and twitching, charred black… is ‘Kobdacleva, the Wise’, the Clan Chief of the Blue Kobu Tribe…
<<<Haa… haa…!!>>>
And the one looking down at him from the dissipating steam, breathing heavily… is ‘Kobdalian of the Raging Flames’, the young Clan Chief of the Red Kobu Tribe…
In other words, the winner of this duel…
…Is Kobdalian!
<<<Ah, guh…! >>>
But even though he won this fight, Kobdalian isn’t in a good situation.
Originally, 【Raging Flames】 is a mana-hungry supernatural ability.
And in his battle with Kobdacleva, he consumed a lot of mana.
Whoosh… whoosh…
Kobdalian’s armor of flames vanished, with a pathetic sound.
And that…
…Became a fatal opening on this battlefield…
<<<Hmph!!>>>
Kobdalian, battered and bruised…
Couldn’t even react…
…To the powerful tail blow that was swung at him the next moment…
<<<Guhaah!?>>>
BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!
Kobdalian, vomiting blood, was slammed to the ground this time.
He endured the pain, and tried to get up again, but he couldn’t muster any strength.
As a last resort, Kobdalian glared fiercely…
…At the giant black Kobudai floating above him… who attacked him…
…At ‘Kobdarok, the Black Rock’… the Clan Chief of the Black Kobu Tribe…!
<<<…You’re still alive? What a terrifying young one. Tch!>>>
Kobdarok, looking down at Kobdalian, who was buried in the ground, clicked his tongue in annoyance.
<<<But it doesn’t matter!>>>
But he quickly grinned…
<<<Because, young one, you’re about to die! Guhohohohoーーー!!>>>
…And let out a disgusting laugh!
