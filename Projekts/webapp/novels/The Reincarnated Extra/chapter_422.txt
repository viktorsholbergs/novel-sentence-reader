The Young Clan Chief, “Kobdalian of the Raging Flames”
* * *
“Kobdalian of the Raging Flames”… that’s the name of the young Kobudai who’s the current Clan Chief of the Red Kobu Tribe.
He succeeded his father, who died on the battlefield, and became the Clan Chief about two years ago.
It hasn’t been long since his sex changed to male, so in terms of years, he’s still a fledgling warrior, but he has the full trust of his clan.
Because he’s strong.
Despite his youth, he’s already over two meters long, and his headbutt can even shatter rocks.
Furthermore, he possesses a supernatural ability to manipulate flames, called 【Raging Flames】, the origin of his nickname.
The demon Kobudai of flames, burning everything to ashes… that’s Kobdalian of the Raging Flames.
His existence is akin to a natural disaster for enemy tribes, and it’s said that his mere presence on the battlefield can greatly tip the scales of victory.
However, Kobdalian, this day, wasn’t on the battlefield. He was in the Red Kobu Tribe village, waiting for Kobdaroze and the others to return.
His supernatural ability, while powerful, has poor fuel efficiency, and once used to its limit, he suffers from mana depletion, his physical abilities decline, and he can’t fight for three days.
Having gone all out and rampaged on the battlefield two days ago, he’s currently on a rest day.
That being said, it doesn’t mean he can’t fight at all.
Just sitting around doesn’t suit him.
So, while absorbing the fog to recover his depleted mana, he was voluntarily patrolling the village.
And it was at that moment.
<<<Aaaah! I found Kobdalian-niichan!>>>
<<<Take this!>>>
There are many large boulders scattered around the Red Kobu Tribe village, providing plenty of hiding places.
From behind one of those boulders, playful young girls suddenly charged at him.
<<<Hmph!>>>
Kobdalian caught the girls’ charge, spun around, lightly blew them away, and laughed heartily.
<<<Hahaha! You thought you caught me off guard, but you’re still naive! Keep training!>>>
<<<Kyaaaーーー! Ahahahaha!>>>
<<<We’ll get you next tiiiime!>>>
The girls laughed happily, hid behind the boulder, and disappeared.
<<<Huu…>>>
Kobdalian couldn’t help but smile at the peaceful scene.
As he casually looked up at the sky, a giant shadow passed overhead.
Swimming through the blue fog… it’s their god, Godkob.
The super giant Kobudai, swimming through eternity without a word.
<<<Oh god… Please continue to protect this peaceful village…>>>
Kobdalian involuntarily closed his eyes and offered a prayer to the god.
At this moment, a quiet, peaceful time flowed through the Red Kobu Tribe village.
<<<C-Clan Chiefーーー!!>>>
But that peace was shattered by the panicked voices of warriors coming from beyond the fog.
<<<Hmm?>>>
Kobdalian looked back at the village entrance, and the ones who appeared, splitting the fog, were the Red Kobu warriors who had gone to fight the Black Kobu Tribe.
They were all out of breath, their faces pale.
<<<What’s wrong!? What happened on the battlefield!!>>>
Kobdalian’s gentle smile vanished, replaced by the expression of a warrior.
Kobdaroze, with a desperate expression, reported to the young Clan Chief…
<<<A-A monster appeared…!!>>>
…He said!
