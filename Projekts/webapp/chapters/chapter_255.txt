Xiao Chuting paused for a moment and then spoke softly, "Now that I have achieved the Purple Mansion Realm and mastered divine abilities, even having my name registered in the Underworld, there are many matters I must refrain from involving myself in now. Yuansi's idea of having me take action is too naive… the four Daoists of Azure Pond Sect are all watching. Using my abilities to influence the situation subtly is still acceptable, but personally taking action to kill Yu Yufeng would break the rules."
Li Tongya hastily cupped his fist in respect and replied, "We shall handle everything according to the Daoist Master's wishes… My family awaits your instructions."
Seeing his respectful attitude, Xiao Chuting nodded approvingly and continued, "I have reviewed the jade slip Yuansi brought back. It indeed contains the footwork technique of Daoist Master Xianyou, which is of great significance to us. Given the good relations between our two families and the fact that your Li Family is currently being oppressed by the Yu Family, it is only right that we offer our help. Although I cannot personally take action, I can still easily handle them."
As a Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm, Xiao Chuting's mere words could make the Yu Family tremble with fear and apologize. Yu Xiaogui would personally come to apologize, not daring to secretly humiliate the Li Family. Such a statement was simply an excuse to suppress the Yu Family and support the Li Family at Moongaze Lake, hence, Li Tongya was naturally eager to hear it and listened respectfully.
"Our Xiao Family is now an independent immortal clan, no longer under Azure Pond's jurisdiction. We cannot arbitrarily send Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to kill Azure Pond's clan members. Fortunately, although our Xiao Family is not powerful, we have a few Foundation Establishment Realm guest cultivators. I will send them to deal with Yu Yufeng," Xiao Chuting said, speaking in a calm tone.
Li Tongya acknowledged this and then voiced his doubt. "However, Yu Yufeng is cautious and spends most of his time in seclusion within the mountain gate, rarely stepping outside. It will not be easy to encircle and kill him..."
"Indeed," Xiao Chuting agreed as he smiled faintly, gently lifting the white jade fishing rod in his hand. He pulled the baitless jade hook from the deep pool, causing ripples on the surface. A knowing smile crossed his face.
"Yu Yufeng will come out. Not only will he come out, but he will also follow the Guli Road eastward to a secluded, nameless hill in Mushroom Forest Plain and wait for us there."
Li Tongya felt a chill down his spine, his pores tingling as he thought to himself, The power of the Purple Mansion Realm's divine abilities is truly formidable...
His face remained serious as he nodded. Xiao Chuting's tone then shifted to one of earnest advice as he said, "As for your Li Family, you must carefully consider your future path. Once the Yu Family falls, there will be no prominent rivals at Moongaze Lake. You must think carefully about what your next steps would be."
"Understood!" Li Tongya nodded solemnly.
Xiao Chuting paused again and then spoke softly, "Someone from the Li Family must join the Azure Pond Sect."
Li Tongya's expression remained unchanged, but his mind was in turmoil. Without hesitation, he asked, "Who do you think is suitable, Daoist Master?"
Li Tongya recognized that Xiao Chuting's tone was not one of solicitation or discussion, but a calm instruction. Thus, he did not question or argue but responded directly.
Xiao Chuting paused for a moment because of Li Tongya's decisiveness, then chuckled softly. "You are a smart man; you should understand this matter. The case of Li Chejing was only because he possessed the Moonlight Immortal Foundation and extraordinary talent. Ordinary disciples would not face such a fate. This strategy is not about sacrificing your family's children for Azure Pond Sect…but rather, it is a threefold beneficial plan."
"Firstly, since your family is still under Azure Pond's jurisdiction, having disciples cultivating within the sect ensures a range of benefits for you—smooth communication, ease in handling matters, and a life-saving backing… all of which are excellent!
"Secondly, the disciples sent to the immortal sect do not need to be exceptionally talented, they just need to be above average. That way, they would not fall victim to harm while still able to contribute to the family. As they progressed to higher cultivation realm, they could even gain some power within the sect."
Xiao Chuting's tone remained polite as he continued, "Our family has separated from Azure Pond, our disciples have withdrawn and most of our informants have lost contact with us, this has left us unaware of their internal situation. If your family can send a disciple inside, it would greatly benefit both our families… As for who that may be, that decision is yours to make."
For a distinguished Purple Mansion Realm cultivator like Xiao Chuting to explain the matter in such detail surprised Li Tongya and left him feeling honored.
"But... it is not easy to become a disciple of Azure Pond..." he responded hesitantly after some time.
However, it seemed like Xiao Chuting had already arranged everything and answered simply, "The population on Qingsui Peak is sparse. Si Yuanbai has left the sect, and our Yuansi has also departed from Qingsui Peak, leaving only his junior sister Yuan Tuan there. Now is the time for assistance; if you send someone to be her disciple, Yuan Tuan will surely not refuse."
"Understood," Li Tongya nodded.
Xiao Chuting stopped speaking, glancing at him before continuing, "You may go now… I hope you will not fail in your duty and lead the Li Family well."
Li Tongya cupped his fists in respect and descended from the cliff, walking down the mountain. When he reached the pond, Xiao Yuansi nodded to him politely in acknowledgment. After watching Li Tongya leave, Xiao Yuansi soared up and landed beside Xiao Chuting, speaking in a soft voice.
"Ancestor… you called for me?"
Xiao Chuting nodded and asked, "Is everything arranged for Guiluan? Does she have any complaints or dissatisfaction?"
"Everything has been prepared. Guiluan has read the information about Li Yuanjiao's achievements carefully and expressed her willingness to marry," Xiao Yuansi responded respectfully.
Xiao Chuting then lifted the white jade fishing rod gently with two fingers and said softly, "It's about time she gets married. Back then, I had introduced her to many young talents in the prefecture, but she remained silent… I figured that she might be inclined to marry outside our family. Thankfully, the Li Family has enough standing."
Xiao Chuting's words clarified the intricacies. After all, the difference between marrying a rogue cultivator to live quietly on a small peak and marrying into another family as the principal wife with a grand dowry was significant.
Xiao Yuansi understood this well and replied softly, "Ancestor, you are wise. Knowing that the Li Family would not marry our direct daughter, you informed Yuansi in advance; otherwise, Yuansi would not know how to deal with Tongya."
Xiao Chuting shook his head and said softly, "Li Tongya is not foolish. The Li Family seeks an alliance, not subservience. Guiluan is sharp and intelligent, which is why she has this opportunity."
Xiao Yuansi, being straightforward and sincere, felt uneasy discussing these matters that stripped away the veneer of friendship. Thus, he remained silent. Xiao Chuting did the same, holding his white jade fishing rod silently.
For a moment, only the sound of the mountain wind howling through the trees was heard, causing Xiao Yuansi's beard and hair to flutter.
Meanwhile, as Li Tongya descended the mountain, he saw two figures waiting at its foot. One wore a brown bamboo hat and had a short, neatly trimmed beard, with long eyebrows reaching his temples. He held a knife in his hand and had a sharp look in his eyes. He was at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm.
Upon seeing Li Tongya, he cupped his fists and said in a deep voice, "Greetings, fellow Daoist Tongya."
The other had white hair and a youthful face with a flowing beard, his eyes bright and penetrating. He cupped his fists in greeting as well and laughed lightly before introducing himself.
"I am Nanshan Weng[1]… Greetings, Fellow Daoist."
Li Tongya cupped his fists hurriedly in return. The swordsman nodded and said in a deep voice, "I am Chen Taojing."
These two were, of course, the people Xiao Chuting had sent to deal with Yu Yufeng. After exchanging a few words with them, Li Tongya saw Xiao Chuchou approaching from afar on the wind, smiling.
"Thank you for waiting."
The others quickly responded, expressing how it was no bother at all.
Xiao Chuchou pointed to the swordsman, Chen Taojing, and introduced him, "This is Chen Taojing, who was once a guest cultivator at Moongaze Lake market. After the market was destroyed, he settled with my family. He practices the River One Qi Technique and has established the Boundless Ocean… just like Brother Tongya."
Li Tongya nodded immediately, and the swordsman's eyes lit up. The two cupped their fists, and Li Tongya said with a smile, "I will need to seek much advice from you, Senior."
"We can learn from each other," the swordsman responded politely.
Xiao Chuchou then pointed to Nanshan Weng and introduced, "Nanshan Weng is an elder in our family."
With one at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm and two at the mid-stage, this was the force the Xiao Family had mobilized. Xiao Chuchou then introduced Li Tongya to the two, and with that, they all took to the wind and headed west.
1. Nanshan Weng actually means "Man from the southern mountain". So that guy is actually using a code name. ☜
