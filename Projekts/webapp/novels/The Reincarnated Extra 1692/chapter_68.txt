The Resolution
* * *
GASHAAAANNN!!!
From the sudden impact, the study room shook violently, causing those inside to stagger and fall over from the shockwave.
Particularly, Mauve, who had been standing near the window, took the Queen’s headbutt directly and was flung away while still holding Sara.
“……SARAAA!!!”
Sara seemed unharmed outwardly, as Mauve’s body shielded her from the scattered debris.
However, Mauve, having taken the brunt of the direct impact, especially on his back, was in a terrible, bloody state.
Both were unconscious and motionless.
Seeing this as an opportunity, Martz tried to rush and rescue Sara, but……his lower body was trapped under the rubble blown away by the earlier impact, rendering him immobile!
He looked around the room.
His wife Emma had likely lost consciousness from the shock and lied fallen on the floor.
“Ahhh! Lady Emma! Lady Emmaaaa!!!”
The butler Sneigen was unharmed……but he was flustered and in disarray over Emma’s fallen state.
In this situation, Sneigen would not listen to Martz’s words.
“Gi, Gi, Gi……Gakakakka!”
An odd sound echoed from the throat of the massive Queen whose head had burst into the study room.
“!!!”
Martz, recalling knowledge from his time as an adventurer, instantly realized the danger.
That was the preparatory motion for a 【Poison Breath】!
“Da, Dammit! Move! Mooooveee!!!”
Martz struggled to free his trapped lower body from the rubble, but to no avail!
The Queen’s gaze was locked straight onto Sara.
In the worst-case scenario, his beloved daughter was the target of that Breath attack.
“Hey! Monster! Over here! Look this waaay!!!”
He shouted loudly, trying to draw the Queen’s attention, but it paid him no heed.
Not a single one of its three eyes, which should have been glowing red, turned towards him. Instead, they were dull and white……devoid of any will.
“Gi……Gigi, Gigia.”
The Queen opened its mouth wide towards Sara.
It was a hopeless situation.
The Breath attack was imminent.
“Damn! Damn damn! Daaaaamn iiiiiittttt!!!!”
Powerless!
So utterly powerless!
His daughter was right there, right in front of him, yet he couldn’t save her! The despair!
Martz screamed!
Help! Someone!
Someone save my daughter!
Please!!
……God!!
It was at that moment.
A small black shadow raced up the Queen’s neck and leapt through the hole in the wall into the study room.
It was the maid-in-training, Emi!
Landing in a spin, Emi positioned herself defiantly before the Queen.
Her appearance was in shambles – bloodied, tattered clothes, and utterly exhausted.
Yet her deep black eyes harbored an unwavering fighting spirit as she had come here.
To protect her friend!!
“Bushyuaaaaaa!!!”
Immediately after, the Queen unleashed its 【Poison Breath】.
Emi spread her small body as wide as possible, taking a defensive stance to shield Sara from the Breath.
Taking the poison in Sara’s stead.
“Gi, Gi……”
“……Cough”
Despite weathering the full 【Poison Breath】, Emi remained standing.
But not unscathed.
A cough, and blood spilled from her mouth.
“A……Aahh……”
Yet, Emi clenched her fist.
Suffering from the poison coursing through her body, wracked with agonizing pain.
In a state where losing consciousness would not be surprising.
“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!”
Gathering every last ounce of her magic power into her fist, Emi struck the Queen’s face with all her might.
The Queen’s unenhanced face could not withstand the blow and exploded into a shower of blood, flesh, and bone fragments as it was blown away. Finally, the Queen’s body ceased all movement.
Zuu, Zuuun……
Outside the mansion, accompanied by an earth-shaking rumble, the Queen’s massive body fell.
The resulting tremor caused the mansion to creak and groan.
Simultaneously, Emi, with a soft thud,
collapsed onto the debris and dust-covered floor of the study, motionless.
