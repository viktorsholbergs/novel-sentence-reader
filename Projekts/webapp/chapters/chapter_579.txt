As the seawater rained back down, a deep and foreboding silence settled over the ocean. Only the soft patter of raindrops on the surface could be heard.
Li Xuanfeng remained steady, bow drawn and ready. A veteran of countless battles, he knew better than to assume the beast was dead.
Sure enough, moments later, a streak of white light shot upward from the ocean, soaring like a gull toward the horizon. But another arrow was already loosed, striking the white light dead center and shattering it into a mist of crimson.
Red rain cascaded from the heavens as Li Xuanfeng approached, his dark armor glinting ominously. The crimson mist spread, staining the sky and ocean alike with its vibrant hue.
The crimson mist spread across the sky, thick and vibrant, like fresh blood dripping into water, rapidly diffusing outward. Against the backdrop of pitch-black storm clouds, it created an unsettlingly horrific sight, enveloping the sea and the heavens above in a suffocating red hue.
A resounding boom shattered the silence as a bright silver lightning bolt streaked across the sky. Li Xuanfeng raised his hand, the black-gold gauntlet he wore now tainted with streaks of crimson, giving it an even fiercer and more menacing appearance.
"Cinnabar…" he muttered.
The expansive crimson fog blanketed an area of a hundred li in every direction. Even the market island nearby was dusted with this eerie red powder. The blood-colored mist blotted out the sky and sun, dyeing the sea an unnerving shade of red. Fish leaped and thrashed about in agitation, their movements creating ripples across the stained waters.
The water ape had tried to shield its head with mana, intending to use its escape technique to flee. However, it was struck down by Li Xuanfeng's arrow, its body dissolving into a vast expanse of cinnabar that concealed the heavens. Mercury-like droplets hovered amidst the crimson mist, propelled by residual mana, their translucent white-gray brilliance shimmering in the red haze. The scene was a breathtaking yet chilling spectacle of red mist interspersed with silver sparks.
Li Xuanfeng lingered briefly amid this strange phenomenon. As he moved toward the water, his thoughts churned, Calcined smoke rising, cinnabar transmuting to mercury… The fact that the Secret White Mercury technique leaves a hundred li of cinnabar upon death is consistent enough.
He descended into the water, finding the entire area transformed into a crimson realm. Everything in sight was bathed in red. Retrieving the Glimmering Inquiry Mirror, he scanned the seafloor, revealing coral reefs and gleaming treasures scattered across the depths. Carefully, he summoned and collected the scattered artifacts and weapons.
When he finally surfaced, the scene above had turned lively. Numerous cultivators were riding the wind, busily working to gather the cinnabar. Some wielded bellows to blow away the mist, while others used jade bottles to collect the reddish seawater. The air was filled with activity and commotion.
The moment Li Xuanfeng, clad in his black-gold armor, emerged from the water, the bustling crowd froze. Silence fell as the cultivators quickly lowered their heads, halting their actions and bowing deeply. "Junior cultivators greet the Daoist!" they murmured deferentially.
Although the water ape's strength was inferior to Li Xuanfeng's, its cultivation level was undeniably profound. Its death had transformed its remains into valuable spirit materials, possibly useful even for Qi Cultivators, prompting a frenzy among the gathered crowd. Li Xuanfeng, however, paid no attention to their clamor. With a calm sweep of his gaze across the scene, he rode the wind and departed.
As soon as he was out of sight, the crowd erupted into chaos. Some hurriedly fanned the cinnabar-laden air with bellows, while others scooped up the red-stained seawater into jade bottles. Every now and then, someone would exclaim in awe, "A late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm demon… taken down just like that!"
After the intense battle, Li Xuanfeng felt his mana significantly depleted, though he was far less fatigued than when he had previously slain a monk from dozens of li away. This time, the combat had been close-range, no more than five or six li, greatly reducing the strain on his mana and stamina.
Landing atop his flying shuttle into the market town, he saw that the cinnabar left behind by the water ape's demise had already been entirely scavenged by the crowd. The only remnants of the frenzy were faint red traces in roof beams and stone pits, hinting at the chaos that had just transpired.
Standing at the forefront was Yuan Huo'e, whose respect now came from the heart. Bowing deeply, he greeted with an overly courteous tone, "We pay our respects to the Daoist… Congratulations on your triumphant slaying of the demon. Your divine abilities and overwhelming mana command admiration and gratitude from us all."
Li Xuanfeng gave a faint nod and motioned for the crowd to disperse. Gesturing toward Zhong Qian, he said in a firm tone, "Disperse. Zhong Qian, follow me."
From a corner, Zhong Qian quickly stepped forward with visible reverence. Cupping his fist, he said, "My gratitude to the Daoist… for saving my life and slaying the demon."
Li Xuanfeng walked into the opulent main hall, pausing before a beautifully constructed spring altar, where spirit springs gushed ceaselessly. Gazing at it, he shook his head and replied, "No need for thanks. I came specifically to slay the demon; your fortune merely aligned with my purpose."
Zhong Qian seemed somewhat uneasy and stood respectfully to the side, saying, "My fortune has indeed always been good… but your rescue is undeniable. I will always remember it. Without your help, I would eventually have been dragged off this island by the demon."
Such fortune, indeed… To steal a Foundation Establishment Realm demon's treasure, escape unscathed, and have someone clean up the mess for you. Li Xuanfeng thought. He waved dismissively and remarked, "I see your cultivation is on the verge of breaking through."
Zhong Qian hesitated before responding, "Your insight is as sharp as ever, Senior. I was indeed planning to find a secluded place to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."
Without showing any emotion, Li Xuanfeng nodded, "There is no need for elaborate plans. Since my task here is complete, I will soon head to Splitreed Island to report back. If you wish, remain on this island and complete your breakthrough before leaving."
Zhong Qian appeared momentarily surprised, as if he had more to say, but upon seeing Li Xuanfeng gesture dismissively, he bowed slightly and replied, "Thank you, Senior."
He quickly retreated. Watching him leave, Li Xuanfeng reflected, Zhong Qian is cautious. Leaving this connection as incidental and unforced inspires trust. If I were to impose a grand life-saving debt, it would only breed suspicion and unnecessary entanglements.
The water ape's remains had scattered into mercury blood and fragments of its belongings. Most of its pills had rolled into the sea, likely benefiting the sea beasts below, while much of its other treasures had been damaged, leaving behind only a few items of value.
Among these were a luminous white Harmonic Noonstone, several heavy pieces of Ocean Resonance Mercury, and two emerald-blue Threadlink Jade pieces, all materials for crafting dharma artifacts.
Aside from these moderately valuable finds, the rest were insignificant trinkets. There might have been talismans or similar items, but none of high grade, and many had been shredded during the fight.
Unfortunately, it carried no cultivation methods on its person. Then again, who would travel carrying their techniques? Li Xuanfeng thought of the many demons he had slain. The water ape had been among the most formidable, with an ancient Immortal Foundation, balanced strengths in all areas, and mastery over concealment, survival, and offensive spells. Yet, its techniques remained out of reach.
"Such a formidable beast, and yet it lacked a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact for protection…" After a moment of thought, Li Xuanfeng speculated that Zhong Qian might have stolen something significant. The ape's extreme agitation suggested as much. Despite claiming it had only been medicinal herbs, what had truly been taken was a mystery known only to Zhong Qian and the water ape.
Gathering the scattered treasures, he summoned Yuan Huo'e to issue a few parting instructions. Not wishing to linger near Zhong Qian and risk any further complications, Li Xuanfeng swiftly took to the skies, transforming into a streak of light as he headed southward.
