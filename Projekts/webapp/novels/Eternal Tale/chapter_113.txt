Chen Xun and the big black ox both turned to look in the direction of the voice.
It was a middle-aged man, with wrinkles on his forehead, at the eighth level of the Qi refining stage. He approached cautiously, respectfully cupping his hands, "May I ask if this is your first time in Yuxu City, sir?"
"Oh? What's the matter?" Chen Xun smiled gently and spread his spiritual awareness around.
The big black ox also quietly observed the surroundings. Being unfamiliar with the place, safety came first.
"You may call me Li Miao," the man suddenly became more enthusiastic. "I have been living in this city for many years. If you need any guidance or introductions, I can assist you."
"I see." Chen Xun suddenly realized; it was a guide. "How much do you charge?"
"Sir, five hours for three lower-grade spirit stones," Li Miao looked around and bowed respectfully, "This is definitely the lowest price. If it were someone else, it would be at least four stones."
Chen Xun and the big black ox felt a slight bang in their hearts upon hearing this. Back then, it took them a whole seven years to earn one lower-grade spirit stone...
"Alright... I'll consider it," Chen Xun nodded lightly, looking at the bustling streets, feeling a bit disoriented.
"Of course," Li Miao smiled awkwardly, standing cautiously beside them, and nervously looking around, afraid of losing business to others.
"Let's wander around first. If we need you, we'll come find you," Chen Xun surveyed the surroundings and chose a direction, "What do you think?"
Li Miao's face brightened, immediately taking out a sound transmission talisman and handing it to Chen Xun, "Sir, if you need anything, just activate this talisman in the vicinity, and I'll come find you."
"Alright." Chen Xun gently accepted the transmission talisman.
"Moo~" The big black ox also let out a low moo and handed the rope to Chen Xun.
They left, but Li Miao stood still, silently waiting, afraid of missing an opportunity.
On the way,
Chen Xun and the big black ox strolled casually. On both sides were shops selling talismans, refining tools, alchemy ingredients, and even buildings buying spiritual beasts and materials.
Everywhere were cultivators coming and going, some frowned, while others showed a hint of joy.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were walking leisurely, already starting to communicate through spiritual transmission.
"Old ox, from now on, we'll make a living here."
Chen Xun smiled slightly at the big black ox and said, "It hasn't been easy coming all this way."
"Moo~" The big black ox wagged its tail, looking at Chen Xun. But the result was always good.
"Golden Core stage cultivation techniques, and alchemy recipes for advancing cultivation... There must be more here than at the Five Elements Sect."
"Moo moo~"
"I think we should at least find a place to stay, right? We can't stay in an inn or guesthouse; it's probably too expensive."
Chen Xun pondered for a moment, "How about buying a house or something? I wonder if there are any in the city. It's surrounded by shops."
"Moo!" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun and looked in a certain direction, where a strong medicinal fragrance emanated.
Danxin Pavilion.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood on the side of the street, looking up at a five-story pavilion, the upper level in a light green color, with an elegant tone.
"Old ox, look at the signboard," Chen Xun squinted slightly, pointing upwards.
"Moo?" The big black ox looked up, and its pupils contracted. "Moo!"
It was the emblem of one of the Ten Sects, the Pill Cauldron Sect, which they had seen on the Southern Dipper Mountains before.
"You're quite something, old ox," Chen Xun chuckled, "Your nose is truly sharp."
"Moo~" The big black ox grinned, it was necessary.
"In the future, we'll have to look for specialized places like this to sell spiritual medicines. Others must be quite generous in their offerings too."
Chen Xun's eyes gleamed as he looked at the cultivators coming and going around him. "Let's avoid catching the attention of those small-time cultivator shops; it could be quite troublesome."
The big black ox nodded, especially towards some wandering cultivators who were trying to scam them. They were so poor and lacked integrity, unlike them.
"Let's wander around some more. There should be shops near the city gate."
Chen Xun looked around and then walked with the big black ox. "This city for cultivators is truly vast, and it has everything."
The big black ox bounced with joy, looking around and occasionally exchanging glances with passing spiritual beasts, greeting them.
After walking for half an hour, they suddenly stopped simultaneously, their noses twitching as a fragrance hit them, mixed with a scent of alcohol.
The Jin Xing Tavern was more than ten times larger than ordinary taverns, and cultivators entered and exited in groups of two or three.
However, there was no noise outside; it was all elegant inside, seemingly equipped with soundproofing formations.
"Old ox, this smell, it's probably from the meat of demonic beasts!" Chen Xun's face was filled with shock. "That stuff is incredibly invigorating for the blood and energy."
"Moo moo!" The big black ox's body trembled a bit, staring with crazy intensity and sniffing with its nose.
They had eaten it before and knew that through certain methods involving mixing with certain spiritual medicines, the meat of spiritual beasts and demonic beasts could replenish a cultivator's blood and energy, even slightly refining their physique.
Chen Xun sighed regretfully. While they were eating meat buns, others were eating such invigorating food every day. They couldn't compare.
"It's okay, old ox. When we earn enough spirit stones in the future, we'll come here for a feast."
"Moo??"
"Haha, of course."
Chen Xun chuckled and patted the big black ox, who extended a hoof and patted him back, indicating his satisfaction. It had to be his big brother who would arrange such things!
"These streets are so complex, and I haven't seen any places to stay."
Chen Xun looked around, where people were bustling and conversing. "Let's go find that young man we met earlier."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded too. In such a huge city, without a guide, they would be completely lost.
Near the city gate, Li Miao was still standing there, waiting. Suddenly, the transmission talisman in his sleeve lit up with a faint light.
His face changed, and he looked in a certain direction, quickly running over, even utilizing his movement technique.
On the street,
Chen Xun handed over a lower-grade spirit stone directly to Li Miao. Li Miao was excited and accepted it eagerly, promising to provide dedicated guidance and assistance.
"Sir, Yuxu City can be divided into five parts."
"Oh?"
"We are currently in the South City, where most of the major sects have their shops and pavilions. If you need to buy materials or pre-order items, this is the place to come."
Li Miao began to talk non-stop, "The East City has many caves and residences. Many Foundation Establishment cultivators live there, and there are often small discussions and auctions held here."
"The West City is the residence of various major immortal sects or forces. Without an invitation, outside cultivators cannot enter at will."
"Are these forces of equal strength to the sects?" Chen Xun's interest was piqued. "Li Miao, tell me more."
The big black ox also looked at Li Miao with confusion. Wasn't it the sects that ruled the Qian Nation? Then the rest were just some wandering cultivators or cultivation families. But some were not respectable enough to even participate in the Southern Dipper Mountain's secret realm.
