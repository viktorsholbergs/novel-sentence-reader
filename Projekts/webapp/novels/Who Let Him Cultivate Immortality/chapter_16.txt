Chapter 16: Yun Zhi’s Talent

Lu Yang’s fellow disciples also noticed the task, chuckling softly, “Every time I see this long-term task, I can’t help but recall Senior Sister’s illustrious accomplishments.”
Another added, “After the truth about Senior Sister fabricating techniques and passing them off as findings from relic caves was exposed, it caused quite a stir.”
“I’ve heard from my master about a relic cave in Lingnan, known as Si Shui Cave. The most precious treasure within is a technique left by the cave’s former master, the ‘Chaos Dawn Technique.’ It was said that cultivating it to perfection could shatter chaos and discern all truths.”
“However, when someone stumbled upon the real ‘Chaos Dawn Technique’ in Si Shui Cave and compared it with what Senior Sister had created, it turned out her fabricated version was actually easier to cultivate and yielded far superior results.”
“Subsequently, numerous techniques were discovered in various relic caves. For those sharing the same name, none were as potent as the ones Senior Sister had created. The revelation left the elders in silence for days.”
Lu Yang: “……”
Lu Yang hadn’t seen the Yun Zhi section in the Scripture Pavilion himself. Presumably, because the techniques Senior Sister concocted were so extraordinary, they were stored at the highest level of the Scripture Pavilion, off-limits without special authorization – essentially, taboo.
“Senior Sister is a talent of the ages, possessing the wisdom to measure the heavens and fathom the earth. It’s no wonder everyone says it’s a blessing for her to act on behalf of the Sect Leader while he’s in seclusion.”
“I’ve even heard rumors that Senior Sister has imprisoned the Sect Leader to usurp his position and become the true Sect Leader herself. It’s said she holds compromising information on the eight great elders, and the high-ranking officials don’t dare to oppose her. Some claim to have heard sobbing from the Sect Leader in a dungeon on Heaven’s Gate Peak at night!”
“Ha-ha-ha, that’s definitely baseless. Such a thing is absolutely impossible.”
While Lu Yang hadn’t heard any alleged sobbing from the Sect Leader on Heaven’s Gate Peak, he didn’t pay much attention to it and continued searching for tasks.
Finally, he found one that suited him:
“According to residents of Taiping Village in Quhe County, a bird-like demonic beast that speaks human language has been spotted. The specific type is unknown, and no records of it harming people or using demonic arts exist. Requesting a Daoist from the Dao Seeking Sect to resolve this issue with the demonic bird.”
After pondering for a moment, Lu Yang accepted the task.
From the description, it seemed like a demonic beast that had mistakenly entered human territory or possibly one that had gained intelligence through a divine encounter. Such beasts wouldn’t have cultivation levels beyond the Foundation Building stage, and their aggressiveness was usually low. There was even a chance it was a beast that had grown close to humans, making it perfect for a newcomer like him.
Moreover, the reward offered by the task hall corroborated this.
The task rewarded thirty contribution points.
It was the minimum reward for a task.
Task rewards were calculated by designated personnel in the Dao Seeking Sect and verified by another person to ensure accuracy. The lower the reward, the simpler the task.
Lu Yang approached the counter, “Brother, I’d like to take on this task of resolving the issue with the bird-like demonic beast.”
“I’d like to take on this task of resolving the issue with the bird-like demonic beast,” another voice said, almost simultaneously with Lu Yang.
The owner of the voice was a young girl in a light pink dress, with delicate features, fair skin, and an enchanting beauty.
Given her sweet appearance and similar cultivation level to Lu Yang, the girl’s identity was clear.
“Junior Sister Peach Blossom Leaf , what a coincidence,” Lu Yang said with a smile. He had only met Peach Blossom Leaf when he first joined the sect and had rarely seen outsiders in the past year while at Heaven’s Gate Peak.
As the first-ranked disciple in the entrance exam, Lu Yang was the senior brother of this batch until a new ranking was established.
In fact, Peach Blossom Leaf’s choice of task was no coincidence. Suitable tasks for Foundation Building cultivators were already scarce, and those from their batch could only undertake a few.
“Turns out it’s Senior Brother Lu, congratulations on reaching Foundation Building. There aren’t many tasks for our level, so why don’t we join forces and share the reward equally?” Peach Blossom Leaf suggested sweetly, her curiosity piqued by this reclusive Senior Brother Lu.
Lu Yang happily agreed.
In the process of completing tasks, it’s not always about the rewards for them; they seek more to gain experience from the process itself.
“How about traveling to Quhe County on a flying boat?” Lu Yang suggested.
…
“Junior Sister Peach Blossom Leaf , did you know that our human race is quite contradictory? Often, people both fear and worship the same things.”
“In ancient times, when demons roamed and disasters were frequent, the weak human race struggled for survival in the gaps of existence.”
“Great demons, relying on their ancestral bloodlines, robust physiques, and innate magical powers, dominated the wild lands.”
“Humans feared these great demons, seeing them as natural disasters, unassailable. Yet, they also worshiped them, longing for their power.”
“Thus, the ancient ancestors developed cultivation techniques, learning magical powers from demonic beasts. They overcame numerous challenges, eventually standing at the pinnacle of the continent, creating a new world for humanity, and ensuring their continued existence!”
“Take, for example, the elements of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. The ancient ancestors feared them, yet yearned for their natural might and authority, the incontestable will of nature!”
“People longed for them, desiring to possess their mighty power and authority. The ancient ancestors questioned the heavens and the earth, faced thunder and lightning, and sought enlightenment in storms. They understood the principles of ‘man follows earth, earth follows heaven, heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows nature, and realized various Daoist techniques!”
“See? This contradictory mentality is essential for humanity to become the dominant race on the continent!”
“And then there’s the sky. Humans long for it, wishing to fly freely like birds, but also revere it, finding it mysterious and unfathomable. This sense of awe is ingrained in our blood, an innate mindset of every human, be it evident or hidden…”
On the flying boat, Lu Yang spoke with passion, standing up and gesticulating as he spoke.
Peach Blossom Leaf, after contemplating quietly, interrupted Lu Yang’s lengthy discourse.
“So, is that why you’re afraid of heights?”
“Yes.”
Peach Blossom Leaf: “……”
Inside the cabin of the flying boat, cruising among the clouds, the boat was engraved with mass-produced balance formations by array masters, ensuring passengers inside felt nothing even during storms.
The skies were clear and bright, perfect for enjoying the sun and scenery on the deck. Peach Blossom Leaf suggested they go out on deck, but Lu Yang, steadfast in his Dao, adamantly refused.
Peach Blossom Leaf, more curious than most, persistently inquired until Lu Yang had no choice but to explain his fear of heights from ancient history. He eloquently linked his fear to historical precedents and various references, suggesting that the fear of heights is a rational and ancient psychology. Broadly speaking, it even contributes to the progress of humanity.
Fortunately, Peach Blossom Leaf didn’t believe a word.
