The Giant Yumushi and the Three Women 4
* * *
Shimemagamo’s golden light.
The moment he recognized that light, the Grand Armored Yumushi felt ‘dread’.
“Yugya…”
And then he realized.
The place where he is now is an exceptional place, even in the Great Grassland of Beginnings—a wasteland.
Because he rampaged here before, and now again.
There are exposed rocks and debris, and fewer plants compared to the surrounding area.
That kind of place.
…It should have been.
“Yugyaah!?”
Before he knew it… his surroundings… no, with Shimegamamo at the center!
The whole area is completely covered in plants!
Even the debris, the dirt that he rained down earlier!
It’s all covered!
And those plants are pulsing—like ripples created by throwing a stone into the water… in reverse.
Towards Shimegamamo… constantly sending in golden light.
In other words, Shimegamamo’s golden light is the power of the grassland.
No, to be more precise.
That light is the remnants of a great being’s power, remaining in the Great Grassland of Beginnings.
And that being is—
In other words—
“Yu, yu, yu, YUGYAAAAAAH!”
Here, the Grand Armored Yumushi instinctively refused to think any further!
He has to do one thing—eliminate that small, golden creature, with all his might!
Reaching that conclusion, he started charging up his mana, his mouth glowing intensely!
That is a sign of a beam attack!
* * *
“…It’s noticed us, but are you done ‘charging’?”
Saint Ad, standing next to Shimegamamo, sensing that sign, asked that, putting a cigarette in her mouth.
Three cigarettes at once.
…No matter how you look at it, It’s clearly an overdose.
Every time she inhales the smoke, her body stores more mana, but in exchange, her physical condition visibly deteriorates.
Her face turned pale, and her eyes were bloodshot.
Her nose started bleeding.
But she did it.
Because she knows that this is the critical moment.
“…Not yet.”
Shimegamamo, on the other hand, her entire body enveloped in golden light, replied curtly, sweating profusely.
What she’s holding in both hands is the large cleaver she has always used to hunt.
But its appearance has changed.
It’s covered in golden, glowing vines, just like Shimegamamo.
And those vines aren’t just covering the cleaver, they’re extending from the blade into the air, lengthening its ‘blade’ with each passing moment.
“You’re not running away… intruder.”
“What about you? Shouldn’t you run away?”
“Don’t be ridiculous. I have my clan’s rules.”
“Don’t you dare mock me. I have my pride too.”
Shimegamamo, readying her cleaver.
Saint Ad, putting out her cigarettes in her portable ashtray.
Without even looking at each other, the two women had a brief exchange.
And then, at the next moment…
“YUGYAAAAAAAHーーー!!!”
The Grand Armored Yumushi fired a purple beam towards them!
“【Barrier・Shield】, ten layers!!”
At the same time, Saint Ad stepped in front of Shimegamamo, thrust her arms forward, and deployed multiple barriers!
…Crack!
The first barrier, faintly glowing, struck by the torrent of purple light, bought them a few seconds, and disappeared.
…Crack!
The second barrier also lasted for a few seconds.
…Crack!
The third barrier as well.
“Haaaaaaaaaaah! DON’T UNDERESTIMATE MEEEEEーーー!!!”
Saint Ad, her eyes bloodshot, put all her strength into it!
Creak… Creak, creak, creak…!
The fourth barrier, groaning… but it’s holding!
It’s been more than ten seconds… and it’s still holding!
It’s still holding!
But…!
“Gah…!?”
Saint Ad coughed, spitting blood, and lost her balance.
Her mana control is faltering!
Crack!
Crack, crack, crack!
And as a result… the fourth, and the fifth to seventh barriers were all broken through!
There are only three barriers left!
“S-Still… Stiiiillーーー!!!”
But Saint Ad held on again!
She regained her balance, lowered her hips, and desperately poured her mana into the remaining barriers!
Crack!
The eighth barrier broke!
Crack!
The ninth barrier broke!
Only one left!
“AAAAAHーーー!!!”
Creak, creak, creak, creak, creak, creak, creak, creak!
The last barrier groaned, and groaned, and groaned, and groaned!
It’s about to break!
At that moment!
“…Charged!!”
Shimegamamo, shining golden, shouted!
And what she swung, raising high into the sky, is!
…A super giant cleaver, made of vines, moss, and grass!
And at the same time!
“Y-Yugya, a…!?”
The Grand Armored Yumushi, letting out a pathetic voice, stopped firing its beam.
It ran out of breath.
In other words!
“We… protected it!!”
In other words, that’s what it means!
“I’ll give you one more… as a bonus!”
Saint Ad collapsed face-down on the ground, but trembling, she somehow lifted her head, and snapped her fingers.
And then, a shining path of barriers, leading straight towards the Grand Armored Yumushi, appeared before Shimegamamo’s eyes.
“Uoooooooohーーー!!!”
Shimegamamo immediately started running down the path of light, as fast as the wind blowing across the grassland!
By the time the Grand Armored Yumushi noticed…!
Shimegamamo had already jumped towards him, and…!
“【Great Grassland Cleaver】 AAAAAAHーーー!!!”
The golden, super giant cleaver, made of plants—in her hands!
Straightforward!
Towards him… she was swinging it down!
The Grand Armored Yumushi—
By that cleaver, which doesn’t even look sharp…
“YUGYAAAAAAHーーー!?”
With a death cry—
…Was cut clean in half!
