Yuan Huyuan's initial visit to the Li Family was to escort Li Chejing home. At that time, his cultivation had already reached the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, while Li Tongya was merely a humble Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. Now that he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Yuan Huyuan had to address him as senior with due respect.
Li Qinghong chuckled and replied, "I'm sorry that his absence disappoints you, Senior. You've come at the wrong time, and our ancestor is currently cultivating in seclusion."
"Ah…"
Yuan Huyuan gave her a look but did not dwell on the subject. Instead, he changed the topic.
"Your family's Xizhi has been cultivating at Qingsui Peak and has become quite formidable, now at the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. I've come on behalf of Ancestor Yuan Tuan to ask this as both of us are Xi Zhi's elders—with the child close to advancing to Qi Cultivation Realm, does your family have any plans for him?"
Li Qinghong feigned surprise before responding without hesitation.
"The cultivation techniques available in the sect are certainly superior to those of my humble clan… We shall let your family ancestor decide."
"Haha," Yuan Huyuan chuckled dryly and replied, "Our ancestor, of course, wants the best for Xizhi. The Grade Four Clear Essence Rain Control Technique is naturally a good choice, but she is thinking of trying out a Grade Five technique…"
"Among the Azure Pond legacies, the Grade Five Dark Floating Compliant Cloud Sutra is exclusive to the Chi Family's direct lineage, and the Heavenly Pronouncement Sutra is a secret that we guard closely..."
Yuan Huyuan shared several points before pausing. He chuckled and then continued, "There are many ancient techniques available though. I wonder how your esteemed family views them…"
Li Qinghong sipped her tea and eyed Yuan Huyuan, who nearly had the Supreme Yin Moonlight written across his forehead. With a resigned thought, she mused, Does he think I'm gullible? This is all too obvious!
A soft chuckle escaped her vermilion lips and she replied, "The Li Family is of humble background, we put our faith in the Old Ancestor."
"Very well… You're an understanding person, young lady."
Yuan Huyuan nodded, despite being secretly surprised. He was a seasoned cultivator now over a century old, and usually treated people with generosity and kindness. His venerable status also carried considerable influence across various families.
Had it not been for the Ancestor Yuan Licheng's greedy scheming, Yuan Huyuan would never have stooped to such measures. With a sigh of relief, he smiled and said, "I have some good news to share with you, young lady."
Li Qinghong gestured for him to continue and Yuan Huyuan announced, "Fellow Daoist Li Xuanfeng from your esteemed clan has successfully established his immortal foundation, Engraved Stone, in Yi Mountain City!"
"What! Uncle Xuanfeng has achieved Foundation Establishment Realm?!" Li Qinghong exclaimed, her face lighting up with a genuine smile.
"Many thanks for this joyful news, Senior Yuan!"
Yuan Huyuan nodded, his face beaming as he replied, "Congratulations! Your family now boasts three generations of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators—truly the mark of a prestigious clan!"
Although the inclusion of Li Mutian in his statement stretched the truth somewhat, it was meant as a felicitous remark. Li Qinghong smiled and thanked him, then heard the rustling sound of falling snow as a man dressed in a black robe entered the hall.
Li Yuanjiao had just returned from escorting Li Ximing. Along the way, he encountered and defeated a devil cultivator. He was merely at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, far below his own capabilities. With a decisive palm strike, Li Yuanjiao ended the confrontation almost instantly and seized the cultivator's storage pouch easily.
Shaking the snow from his cloak, he tossed the blood-stained pouch onto the desk, exhaling warm breaths into the cold air. Glancing at Yuan Huyuan, he asked, "And you are…?"
"Yuan Huyuan from the Yuan Family," the man replied. After Li Qinghong explained the situation to Li Yuanjiao, he smiled at the man and said, "Greetings, Senior."
Li Yuanjiao was not surprised by the news, having already anticipated it.
Yuan Huyuan added, "Furthermore, Senior Xuanfeng has been promoted by Daoist Master Yuan Su and serves as a general in Yishan City… He could be considered a distinguished member of the Azure Pond Sect now."
The siblings exchanged a glance with each other. Given their family's unpleasant history with the Azure Pond Sect in the past, they had already lost their trust in those Purple Mansion Realm cultivators long ago. They could only muster a strained smile, bracing for potential complications.
Yuan Huyuan then mysteriously remarked, "Daoist Master Yuan Su has always been a loner and kept his distance from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators within the sect. He has neither immortal peaks nor prestigious clans under his command. Your family could seize this opportunity..."
Seeing the thoughtful looks on the siblings' faces, Yuan Huyuan laughed heartily and cupped his fist.
"Well… I've delivered the message. I shall take my leave now!"
After the siblings had escorted Yuan Huyuan out of the formation, they returned to the hall, still puzzled.
Li Yuanjiao then mused, "I heard that Daoist Master Yuan Su's immortal foundation is Spring's Echo, which has completely nothing to do with Engraved Stone… This immortal foundation is probably only valuable in the Golden Tang Gate…"
A thought suddenly struck Li Qinghong as she remarked, "Spring's Echo? Our family has a cultivation technique related to that—Uncle Xuan's Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique, though it's merely Grade Three and can only be cultivated to the Foundation Establishment Realm. If it's from the Azure Pond Sect, even the technique to form this immortal dao will surely surpass Grade Three."
Realizing their speculation led nowhere, they finally gave up in resignation. Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao pulled out a green-colored jade bottle from a storage pouch.
"Take a look at this," he said with a grin.
His journey to the Xiao Family involved more than just escorting his nephew.
Back then, Li Xuanxuan had unknowingly acquired a spirit water of heaven and earth from a devil cultivator's storage pouch in the marketplace. For a long time, they had not been able to identify it. So, Li Yuanjiao had taken the opportunity to consult Xiao Yuansi himself.
Xiao Yuansi, well-versed and insightful, quickly referenced several books before determining the substance's nature.
Seeing Li Qinghong's baffled expression, Li Yuanjiao explained, "This spirit water of heaven and earth is comparable to a treasured panacea. Named Earth Fiend's Cold Spring, it could quench fire poison, replenish baleful qi, and harmonize with numerous techniques—truly valuable spirit water!"
"Comparable to a treasured panacea..?" Li Qinghong repeated, tightening her grip on the bottle.
A Treasured panacea was far more significant than mere spirit items of the Foundation Establishment Realm. While items like Wanglin Blossom qualified as a spirit item of the Foundation Establishment Realm, they could not be called treasured panacea.
The distinction was profound—Foundation Establishment Realm spirit items benefited only cultivators in that realm, whereas the treasured panacea possessed miraculous properties that even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators coveted.
The two siblings put away the spirit water of heaven and earth and took out Li Xizhi's letter, carefully reading it.
After a moment, Li Yuanjiao silently put the letter away. Li Qinghong stood up, holding her spear. Having scanned the letter with her spiritual sense and read its contents, she clenched her jaw and said gloomily, "A hundred and twenty Spirit Stones? Are they crazy?! What kind of spiritual qi of heaven and earth costs that much? It's extortion!"
Although that was what she said, Li Qinghong looked at her silent elder brother, unsure of his thoughts. She then asked tentatively, "Are we still amassing the funds for Zhi'er?"
Li Yuanjiao put the letter away gently, then gritted his teeth. He raised his eyebrows, looking somber as he replied, "Yes… Even if it means selling off all the spirit items in our treasury."
He paused and then asked in a deep voice, "How many Spirit Stones do we have in our family's savings?"
Li Yuanping, who was nearby, stepped forward and replied, "More than eighty."
As soon as Li Yuanping answered his question, he quickly added, "It's almost time to pay our tributes though, Big Brother! After we gave Qingxiao a sum of Spirit Stones, we're already struggling… We can't afford to spend these savings!"
