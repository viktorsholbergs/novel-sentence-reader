When Lu Jiangxian was brought back to the stone platform, he quietly surveyed the courtyard with his divine sense.
Watching Li Mutian slowly make his way in, leaning against the door frame to catch his breath with his eyes closed, evoked a wave of emotions within him.
“I didn’t realize that so much time had passed.”
The day Li Xiangping picked up the mirror from the river, Li Mutian was still the solemn head of the Li Family, his eyes reflecting the wisdom of years gone by.
Now, he appeared as an elderly man, weakened by the passage of time, spanning over seventy years.
Ever since Lu Jiangxian transmigrated to this world, he had always been drifting in and out of sleep within the mirror and thus, experienced time differently. Nearly twenty years had passed, yet to him, it felt like merely a month.
The Li Family had risen to prominence, establishing itself as an emerging force in the world of immortal cultivation.
Li Mutian’s health had been deteriorating with each passing day. It almost seemed as if he had expended his remaining strength to push the Li Family’s rapid growth, leaving him like a candle flickering in its final moments.
Through his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian could tell that Li Mutian’s life force was ebbing away and his final days were drawing near, with only a few days remaining at best.
Sitting peacefully by the door, Li Mutian’s solemn expression softened into a faint smile as he watched Li Xuanfeng speaking with a bow in hand.
Clearing his throat gently, Li Mutian voiced his first request in over a decade.
“I’d like to have some mutton noodles,” he said.
Li Xuanfeng was baffled for a moment, listening as Li Mutian repeated his request again, “Your grandfather wants some mutton noodles.”
Li Xuanfeng responded promptly and dashed off without glancing back. His grandfather’s peculiar manner of speaking stirred a profound sense of concern within him. His request sounded more like a plea than a command.
Li Xuanfeng, who had always been astute, felt a chill run down his spine.
“Grandpa wants some mutton noodles!” Li Xuanfeng’s announcement left Ren Ping'er stunned.
Seeing tears welling up in the child’s eyes, she quickly gathered a few women in the household and then patted Li Xuanfeng on his shoulder.
“Go get your father home at once,” she urged.
The steaming mutton noodles, garnished with a bit of scallion and glistened with oil, released a rich fragrance. It was served on the table in a porcelain bowl with a small chip on its edge, along with a pair of wooden chopsticks.
Li Mutian had used the same bowl for thirty-one years. The small chip was accidentally made by Li Xiangping during his youth, resulting in the child receiving a beating for it that left him in tears and wary of Li Mutian for several days afterward.
Li Mutian slowly took his seat at the table, then shakily picked up some noodles with his chopsticks. The tangy and spicy soft noodles, combined with the inviting aroma of mutton soup, caused his limbs to tremble. Its flavor evoked a flood of memories, causing him to break down into tears as it reminded him of the mutton noodles that his father, Li Genshui, had personally cooked for him.
Although it was less flavorful, with less vinegar, more spices, and not enough broth, both his mother and Li Mutian knew it was a form of apology from his father.
However, Li Mutian threw the bowl on the ground and left home, never returning until twenty-eight years had passed.
Li Mutian had scolded his father for his indecisiveness, as it would only bring ruin upon the entire family.
His father, Li Genshui, scolded him in return, accusing him of being heartless and ruthless as a wolf, and condemning him for being the vile spawn of his wife and a wolf.
In his anger, Li Mutian pointed a knife at his father, who was so livid that his lips turned purple and his face was stained with tears.
Twenty-eight years later, when Li Mutian returned home, he discovered that his father had died at the hands of the Yuan Family, as he had expected.
He later presented the heads of the members of the Yuan Family to his father’s grave with a cold smile, then divided up the fields at home. Yet, he often woke up at night to find his pillow soaked through.
These memories flashed through Li Mutian’s mind in a mere dozen breaths, as he collapsed after just one bite of the noodles.
A searing pain erupted within him, as if charcoal had lodged in his chest, scorching his flesh and searing his skin. Intense pain seized his body, and he felt as if a steel blade was slicing through his belly.
The charcoal seemed to bounce from his chest and rush into his mouth, drying out his tongue and throat. His limbs stiffened and became rigid, making it impossible for the women around him to lift him.
“Grandpa! Grandpa!”
Li Mutian could hear the faint cries of Li Xuanling. He recognized him as Li Tongya’s eldest son. Though only five years old, he was known for his composure, just like Tongya when he was little.
Feeling a surge of panic, Li Mutian attempted to make some noise, hoping to reassure everyone that he was all right. However, all that escaped his lips were a few weak, wailing sounds, reminiscent of a distressed dog's cries.
“Move him to the bed! To the bed!” Ren Ping’er called out through her tears, urging those present to transfer the old man to his bed.
She had only bid farewell to her own father, Ren Ping’an, a few years ago. Now, seeing Li Mutian on the verge of death, she could not bear to let him pass away on the cold, unforgiving floor.
“Where’s Mother?” Tian Yun asked urgently, only to learn that Li Mutian’s wife, her mother-in-law, had descended the mountain to visit her own family a few days ago.
It took several people to carefully move the rigid body of Li Mutian onto the bed together.
In the backyard, Lu Jiangxian observed the scene with a mixture of emotions. He quickly cast a Tranquil Mind Spell, harnessing the energy of the moonlight to sustain the old man’s fading life force.
Only when he noticed Li Xiangping and the others hurrying up the mountain did he cease his efforts.
“He’s reaching the end of his lifespan,” Lu Jiangxian commented as he sensed Li Mutian's life force gradually fading.
Li Xiangping and Li Tongya finally entered the courtyard, with the tearful Li Xuanfeng following behind them.
With a worried expression, Li Tongya held Li Mutian’s hand. The mana of the peak Embryonic Breathing Realm slowly flowed into Li Mutian’s body. Li Mutian jerked slightly, and with a deep exhale, finally opened his eyes.
“Xiangping… Tongya…” he whispered the names of his sons, his gaze drifting over the faces of those gathered around him. He moved his mouth, but his voice was barely audible.
Tears streamed down Li Tongya’s face as he bent down to listen to Li Mutian’s words.
“Chen, Tian, Liu... families have deep roots in the village. Gather them with their clans back to Lijing Village. Transform the village into a town... Don’t worry about their ambitions…”
Li Xiangping, trying to hold back his emotions, urged, “Father, you need to rest first. We can talk about this once you’re feeling better.”
However, Li Mutian shook his head and persisted, “The disciples of the Li Family have become more bossy. We must establish a hierarchy and exercise more control. The direct four descendants should form the major sect, while the rest of those bearing the Li surname should form the minor sect. The rest should become the branches. Make sure all of them work together…”
“Xuanxuan can handle the family affairs, but you and the others must watch over him. Xuanfeng is highly intelligent, but we must prevent him from indulging in violence. Xuanling is steady and calm, capable of achieving great things... Jingtian... has beauty... but she must be protected… You must… beware of Mount Yue too...!”
As Li Mutian’s voice grew weaker and weaker, Li Xiangping leaned in closer with tears welling up in his eyes.
Suddenly, the old man violently grabbed his wrist with a force that did not belong to a dying man. His eyes flashed with intensity as he writhed on the bed. Speaking through gritted teeth, his voice suddenly turned loud as he said, “Abandon all four villages… if needed… Do not be like the Wan Family... As long as a descendant of the Li Family survives... anything is possible…”
Tears were streaming down Li Xiangping’s face as he replied through gritted teeth, “I’ll keep that in mind... Father!”
Upon hearing Li Xiangping’s response, Li Mutian released his grip. His breathing stopped, leaving the room in mournful silence and tears.
Yet, the old man’s gaze remained fixed on the bowl of mutton noodles nearby.
The spicy and tangy broth was still piping hot.
