"Moo~"
The black ox kept nudging Chen Xun, its eyes filled with excitement. _Is this the world of cultivators? It's so amazing, _I thought.
"Old ox, old ox...." Chen Xun held the ox's head with one hand and the reins with another. His lips trembled slightly. “The many years we have lived were really wasted up to this point.…"
"Moo!" The black ox gave Chen Xun another nudge, implying that it definitely hasn't been a waste.
Chen Xun didn’t respond and kept muttering "awesome" under his breath, as if he was in a daze.
One stall alone could keep them captivated for a whole day, and this was just a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg of the cultivation world.
They kept walking around until evening, until they finally felt a little exhausted, so they found an empty spot and laid on the ground. The earth was their bed, and the sky was their blanket. They leaned against each other and eventually fell asleep, but they didn’t completely let down their guard.
Inside the valley, disciples from various sects maintained the order, making sure the place was not chaotic. Those with grievances were told to settle them outside the valley.
Three days later, countless vagabonds gathered in clusters. Their eyes were filled with fierce ambition, and the magical artifacts in their hands emitted a constant stream of dazzling light.
They were determined to ascend into a higher heavens on this day!
"It's so lively."
Leading the black ox to the edge of the crowd, Chen Xun looked towards the center of the valley. There were ten high platforms there, engraved with intricate patterns and embedded with materials that were clearly of not ordinary origin.
"Moo~ Moo!" The big black ox raised its head, gazing at these structures from a distance. It could sense a strong aura around them, an aura they had never sensed before in the mortal realm.
**_Buzz... Buzz..._**
A streak whizzed in the air followed by the booming sounds of wind being broken. A massive ship suddenly emerged in the sky. A flag fluttered at its stern amidst the turbulent winds. Atop the ship were standing several figures. They appeared ethereal, seemingly not belonging to this word.
"The Qingyang Sect has arrived!"
"One of the Ten Great Sects of Qian Nation!"
"The Void Shattering Ship…. Incredible!"
The valley resounded with countless exclamations of amazement. These vagabonds were well-versed and immediately recognized the name.
Chen Xun and the black ox, the pumpkins they were, could only stare in shock.
**_Chirp! Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!_**
Four enormous red spirit beasts flew in the sky, over their heads, and emitted high-pitched cries. Riding on their backs were a group of people, their eyes scanning the Nine Stars Valley.
"Another of the Ten Great Sects, the Purple Cloud Sect!"
"I’ve heard that it has an unimaginable number of beautiful, fair maidens. If only I could meet any of them!..."
"Those are Red Mist Jade Phoenixes! Only a sect like that could afford to raise them."
...
The arrival of the ten great sects brought a crazed atmosphere into the valley, and the spirit beasts that flew in the air added to enthusiasm.
This display further cemented the fact that these sects were abundant with resources in the longing heart of the vagabonds scattered around the valley.
On the other hand, the smaller sects within the valley felt sour. When would they be able to enjoy a grand entrance like that of the Ten Great Sects. They were forever trapped in a vicious cycle, and every year they had to be reminded that they could only remain obscured by their behemoth shadows.
Everyone watched as, one after another, the Ten Great Sects made their entrance, causing the sky within the valley to rumble incessantly. It seemed like they were competing amongst each other, showcasing their respective sect’s strength to the vagabonds watchings.
The vagabonds were stirred up to the point of breathlessness, their faces flushed. Their excitement had reached a climax, and they were on the cusp of exploding. Their chance to ascend into a higher heavens was presented right in front of their eyes!
Chen Xun and the black ox were already on their knees. Their feet had given way long ago from the excitement.
If you lent Chen Xun your ear at this moment, all you would hear would be an unending stream of “_Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow,”_ under his breath.
This display was much more exaggerated than when those cultivators recruited disciples back in the mountain village.
This was the true cultivation world….
"If a cultivator from the Ten Great Sects invited me to do miscellaneous tasks..." Chen Xun dreamily said as he looked at the high platform with hopeful eyes, "I would say I'm willing in a heartbeat. And If they have an age limit, I hope its in the ten thousand years mark."
"Moo~ Moo!!"
The big black ox kept nodding its head. It could also help. It was in fact quite efficient in plowing fields.
On the ten high platforms, practitioners from different sects stepped forward. There were both men and women among them. They stood with their hands behind their backs, their eyes piercing.
The Foundation Establishment stage cultivators exuded a suppressive aura towards the vagabonds.
The faces of everyone changed, and they became considerably more composed in their hearts. All eyes were fixed on the high platforms.
"The rules remain the same. Those under the age of forty have the chance to partake in the five trials and enter a sect."
An elderly man stood at the forefront, channeling his Spiritual Energy and shouted, "Those who are interested, enter the trials. The valley will be closed seven days later!"
**_Roar!_**
**_Roar!_**
War cries filled the valley as the eyes of the vagabonds shot with blood. They looked towards the directions of the sects they were interested in and stepped forward.
Some sects had set up arenas, while others had tests for spiritual roots. They all had different tests, but each was aiming to select the most outstanding disciples among the vagabonds, in the end.
Every year, numerous people would suffer injuries or even die, yet that stopped no one from stepping forward. In the Qian Nation, it was difficult to obtain Foundation Establishment Pills. One could only have such a chance in the major sects.
The elders of various sects roamed around, secretly observing those who hadn’t made the cut. And when they found someone they favored, they would personally invite them.
This was something the Ten Great Sects tacitly accepted, after all, they needed to leave some wiggle room for others.
"Old ox, let’s not participate," Chen Xun suddenly said.
"Moo?"
"We don't have much of a chance. We won't be able to pass the spiritual root trial. And our strength might not be up there either." Chen Xun gave the black ox a side glance. He wasn't going to risk his life needlessly. "However… I suddenly have this idea. We can make some money."
"Moo?!" The big black ox was immediately interested. They were really lacking in spirit stones.
Chen Xun discreetly took out a small booklet and glanced around, then said, "Let's analyze the strength and weaknesses of the trials of each major sect first."
"Moo?"
"He said the rules won't change, remember? If we can form a good idea of these trials and compile them into a guide, we could sell it to the vagabonds next year.” Chen Xun patted the black ox, "This will save them so much trouble and likely save their lives even. Do you understand?!"
"Moo moo!"
The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, its eyes filled with excitement. _You're truly brilliant_, It thought.
"Let's go!" Chen Xun's lips rost into a cunning curve.
They first went and observed the arenas, continuously recording the trials the vagabonds underwent, trying to figure out the most optimal series of actions to ensure a smooth victory.
He analyzed each major sect's trial and accordingly categorized them, taking into account which would be the most smooth sailing.
And with that, seven days passed in the blink of an eye.
The duo were left astounded when they noticed that the seven days were up. They hadn’t managed to finish their guide yet.
With the end of the trials, all ten great sects took their newly chosen disciples and left. The many elders of the smaller sect also took their leave, seemingly satisfied.
The ones who died in the trials were handled by the people from the smaller sects who were responsible for maintaining order within the valley.
"I shouldn't have gone to the trial of the Purple Cloud Sect. It wasted a lot of time and Spiritual Energy. It wasn't suitable for me at all!"
A vagabond pounded his chest and stomped his feet. He had wasted yet another year. How long was his lifespan, anyway? After he hit the forty year mark, there would be no more chances.
"At least the trial of the Purple Cloud Sect was not deadly. Cheer up, my friend Zhou, you’ve managed to keep your life."
"Well, if it still doesn't work out next year too, I'll enjoy secular prosperity."
"Yes, we can only do that."
The many vagabonds who had failed brushed past Chen Xun, their eyes filled with sorrow and self-doubt. Some even went mad and were killed by the sect disciples within the valley.
Others succumbed to reality, in the end, they weren’t suited for immortal cultivation. They would return to the mortal world and never set foot in this valley again.
However, it was not peaceful after the trials had ended, and a carnage ensued outside the valley. The older vagabonds who were already past the age of forty were hiding, waiting, for potential prey.
Fierce battles erupted, and Chen Xun and the black ox ran with their heads tucked. Luckily, they appeared poor, so no one targeted them.
"Old ox, let's head to the outskirts of the mountain range!"
"Moo!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox fled frantically. No one was to be trusted. All they could do was run. The dark side of the cultivation world had just begun to unfold.
