Farewell, Kamasse
* * *
“No— I could just smell the stench of criminality! That’s why I absolutely couldn’t register her as an adventurer! That’s why I had to refuse!”
The depraved receptionist’s shrill words resonated through the lobby that had fallen silent after rendering Kamasse dumbstruck.
“Y-You…weren’t actually an adventurer?”
Finally rebooting, Kamasse turned toward me with a questioning tone.
I nodded in response.
“Not yet. That woman told me to complete a ‘task’. If I kept gathering Cysh Grass for a month……”
“Ahhh—!! Ahhh—!! Guard! Please apprehend that cursed child immediately~! Maintaining public order falls under your jurisdiction, doesn’t it!?”
“R-Roger that! Leave it to me!”
The depraved receptionist raised her voice to drown out my inconvenient revelation.
Responding to her provocation, the guard approached to apprehend me.
“Tch!”
As for Kamasse—
Kamasse tried to lunge at the guard.
To protect me.
How gratifying.
But Kamasse, that won’t do.
The very instant he stepped forward toward the guard, I grabbed Kamasse’s belt and flung him behind me.
THUD!
Crashing into the reception counter with his back, Kamasse grunted.
My apologies.
“H-Hey, Emi, what are you……”
But you mustn’t go any further.
If you raise your hand against the guard, you’ll become a criminal yourself, Kamasse.
There’s no need for you to suffer any harm on my account.
I’ll be perfectly fine.
This is something I’ve grown accustomed to since my previous life, after all.
Enough—
There’s no further need for you to accompany me any longer, Kamasse.
Slowly, slowly.
I stepped forward.
“What’s this? Given up and resigned to your arrest?”
The guard gloated with a smug look.
……As if I would.
I haven’t committed any wrongdoing.
Releasing my 【Intimidation】 aura.
Directing my killing intent at him.
“Hih!?”
That alone caused the guard to let out a small yelp as his legs buckled.
Ahaha.
How feeble.
<Shall we start by killing this one first?>
……Extra-sama.
Thank you for raging so furiously on my behalf.
But please, remain calm.
I won’t be doing anything like that.
<Why not?>
Because then I would truly become a criminal, you see?
It’s different from slaying bandits.
……After all, Kamasse stuck his neck out to defend me.
Despite me being a cursed child.
Despite everyone telling me to leave town.
Kamasse alone took my side.
I absolutely don’t want to waste that kindness he showed me.
<Emi……>
“I haven’t done anything wrong. So I won’t be arrested.”
My voice rang out through the hushed lobby.
“But if you’re telling me to leave, then I’ll leave. Goodbye.”
I began walking toward the entrance.
Perhaps out of fear from the magic power and killing intent leaking from me, the business owners and bystander adventurers unconsciously shrank back, clearing a path.
“You……You! Emi! Are you really okay with this!?”
A voice called out from behind.
It was Kamasse, coughing as he stood back up.
“To be scorned so unjustly like this! Treated this way! And still you’ll just leave silently!?”
“Kamasse……”
I turned back toward him.
His face flushed red.
Tears welling up in his eyes.
Kamasse wore an expression of utter anguish.
“Thank you.”
Ah, it’s truly regrettable I can’t form a smile.
“Thank you for defending me, Kamasse. I was really grateful.”
“Emi……!”
“You’re intelligent, reasonably strong, and incredibly kind, Kamasse. You’ll definitely become a true special-rank adventurer someday.”
Turning away once more, I placed my hand on the branch entrance door.
“Emi! Wait……”
“Hang in there, okay!!”
Without waiting for Kamasse to finish, I dashed outside.
Instantly activating 【Body Strengthening】.
Utilizing the 【Grasshopper】 dash technique.
I sprinted at full speed, practically leaping with each step.
In no time at all, I passed the main street and reached the outer walls.
Scaling them with 【Silverfish】, then dropping down on the other side.
Outside of town.
The wilderness.
Running through the wilderness. Onward and onward.
Town rapidly vanished from sight.
Farewell.
Farewell, Kamasse.
In the end, I couldn’t become an adventurer.
In town, I was constantly bullied.
The medicinal herbs only amounted to exploitation in the end.
But I’m glad I met you.
Just for that alone, I’m grateful to have come to this town of Yoshanka.
I truly feel that way.
So gratified.
I’m overjoyed, really.
Tears are spilling out.
These are tears of joy.
Tears of pure joy.
Thank you, Kamasse.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Truly, thank you.
The relentless sea winds continued whipping against me, bitingly cold headwinds.
But my heart felt warm.
All thanks to you, Kamasse.
Thank you.
