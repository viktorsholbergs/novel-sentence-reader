The rain drizzled outside, yet it was unusually quiet inside the carriage.
Li Tongya stroked his beard and spoke thoughtfully, "This person is quite calculative... Who could have foreseen such rapid progress in his cultivation? He probably hopes to take advantage of the turmoil over the lake to swiftly break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. With that attainment, he could travel between heaven and earth unrestrained. On his territory, he can rely on formations and geographical advantages to resist Yu Xiaogui. Even if he's outside of his territory, the Yu Family is hesitant to act against his family..."
Li Tongya had just finished speaking when Li Yuanxiu picked up the thread, speaking in a grave tone. "Moreover, with his talent, it's impossible for him to stop at Foundation Establishment Realm… Once An Jingming escapes abroad, who would dare to touch his family? In twenty or thirty years, he could return as a peak Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator… or even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!"
Li Xuanxuan was silent for a moment before looking up.
"..But it's not so simple. Our Li Family has now expanded to the borders on both sides. With a mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in Mount Yue to the west, there's no way out. If the An Family appears in the east, our Li Family will be sandwiched between Moongaze Lake and Mount Dali, leaving us no room to expand."
Seeing that the two younger men were taking this seriously, Li Tongya nodded, already formulating a plan in his mind. He looked at Li Yuanxiu and asked with a smile, "Do you have a plan?"
Li Yuanxiu was instantly invigorated, knowing that Li Tongya was testing him. He cupped his fist and replied in a low voice, "When our family annexed the Lu Family because of Lu Yuanlu's foolishness, it was done poorly. The families around the lake don't say it openly, but they have been quietly critical and vigilant. If we rashly interfere in the An Family's affairs, we might provoke public anger... For now, we can rely on another tiger to devour the wolf."
Seeing that both elders nodded, Li Yuanxiu smiled and continued, "We are anxious, but the Yu Family is even more so. With the rise of the Xiao Family's business, we have strong external support. We are also internally backed by the deterrence of a sword immortal, allowing An Jingming to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm only means we are trapped in between. However, the Yu Family forcefully collects tributes from the families around the lake and frequently interferes in their affairs, gradually encroaching through vassal marriages, earning them deep resentment from every family. However, the Yu Family's strength is formidable, and Yu Mugao's tactics are sophisticated, managing to suppress and divide the major families, which is exactly why they've stabilized the situation."
Li Yuanxiu chuckled softly and added, "They are the ones who fear An Jingming's advancement to Foundation Establishment Realm the most. Once they learn of this news, even their Purple Mansion Realm ancestor, Yu Xiaogui, might emerge from his seclusion."
"Indeed." Li Tongya nodded in approval, exchanging glances with Li Xuanxuan before instructing, "Since Xiu'er has a plan, you will be left to handle this matter. Leak the news discreetly to the Yu Family."
"Understood!" Li Yuanxiu said as he cupped his fist, confidently departing to carry out his plan.
Li Xuanxuan watched him go with a chuckle while Li Tongya glanced at him and grinned cheekily.
"You've raised a fine son!"
"Heh." Li Xuanxuan laughed, clasping his fist and adding, "Just so Second Uncle knows, my first wife will give birth again in a few months, adding a sibling born of the same mother to Xiu'er."
"Oh!" Li Tongya raised an eyebrow and spoke softly, "You have indeed done well in this respect. Ling'er is faithful, Feng'er is still trapped in past events, and among the younger generation… you are the only one who has spread his branches and leaves."
With a wave of his hand, Li Tongya's brow furrowed with worry again as he said in a grave tone, "Indeed, An Zheyan was right back then… Yu Mugao is a ruthless man. He fears An Jingming, but he also fears our Li Family. He will certainly not let our family off easily. Over the years, the Fei Family has caused him many troubles, and the Yu Family has annexed two others, so he simply hasn't had the chance to act. The quieter this man is, the more uneasy I feel..."
Li Xuanxuan listened to these words and fell silent for a moment, then cupped his fist once more.
"Now that Xuanling is in seclusion to break through, we brothers must be more cautious… Unless Yu Xiaogui himself takes action, who could possibly threaten us?"
"Indeed..." Li Tongya nodded gently. Li Xuanxuan then asked for some guidance on his cultivation. Although Li Tongya had been cultivating for many years and they did not practice the same techniques, his advice suddenly enlightened Li Xuanxuan, who left in a better mood.
Once I return to the mountain, I can focus on advancing to the Foundation Establishment Realm. I can't rest easy until there's a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator overseeing this lake and mountain…
At this thought, Li Tongya sighed softly and closed his eyes to meditate.
When the Li Family's troops returned to the four towns of Lijing, there was not much noise of carriages and horses. Most of the influential members of the Li Family had left the town, leaving only Li Yuanyun to welcome them at the town's entrance.
Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanxiu alighted from their carriages and the brothers embraced, talking about the events of the past few months.
Standing nearby, Li Qinghong held her spear with a cheerful smile. Dressed in leather armor, the teenage girl, now around twelve or thirteen years old, had bright eyes and wore her black hair neatly in a ponytail. With the characteristic gray-black eyes of the Li Family, she stood gracefully as she watched her brothers smilingly.
"Qinghong!"
Li Yuanjiao scratched his head awkwardly. Having grown up beside her, he had always treated her more like a boy, and never thought it odd. Now, having been away for a few months and returning to see her blossom into a young lady, he felt momentarily embarrassed and called out to her somewhat awkwardly as if he hardly recognized her.
"What's the matter, Brother Jiao? After fighting in the mountains for months, you don't recognize your little sister anymore?" Li Qinghong's raised her eyebrows slightly as she teased him. Her usually gentle eyes suddenly lit up brightly. Since she wore no makeup on her face, her cheeks were slightly rosy.
"Not at all!" Li Yuanjiao replied as he laughed heartily. The conversation allowed him to feel more at ease and he said, "Once I return to the town, we'll have a match!"
Li Yuanxiu smiled warmly, pulling Li Yuanyun to the front, and prompting Li Qinghong to greet him right away.
"Brother!"
Li Yuanxiu was pondering the arrangements for their return to the town. Hearing her voice, he looked up, his eyes twinkling immediately as he smiled.
"Qinghong, you've grown much taller this year!"
As the younger generation chatted, a serious-looking man with slightly graying temples alighted from the carriage behind them.
It was none other than Li Xuanxuan.
"Father."
Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanxiu called out respectfully, to which Li Xuanxuan nodded in acknowledgment.
The sight of Li Qinghong's smile momentarily stunned him, as if he was seeing Li Jingtian from more than a decade ago. While Li Jingtian exuded a gentler, calmer demeanor, Li Qinghong's eyes sparkled with energy, lending her a lively and assertive air.
"Uncle!" Li Qinghong called out with a smile, which made Li Xuanxuan feel a slight emptiness in his heart. He responded, but his mind had wandered off.
I should visit Jingtian too… Having secluded myself for so many years, and immediately going on a campaign in the mountains after emerging from seclusion, I have not seen her even once.
Li Xuanxuan was instructing these younger relatives on their cultivation while Li Yuanxiu stood behind silently. Li Pingyi quickly approached him and whispered, "Young Family Head, Tian Zhongqing has already been summoned."
Li Yuanxiu ran through his plans repeatedly in his mind before nodding and replying, "Have him wait for me at the Clan Affairs Courtyard."
