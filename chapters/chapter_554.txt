Li Xuanfeng led the group across Lake Xian, finally arriving at the coastal waters. The waves surged as the sea stretched in endless blue, and Ning Dingbo, the elder Ning brother, stepped forward to gather the disciples.
Once the Azure Pond disciples had assembled, Ning Dingbo flashed a smile, revealing his white teeth as he explained, "This area is called the Shallow Sea… The water here is not very deep; it got submerged during the great battles of ancient times. Most of the islands you see now were once immortal mountains, while the remaining few were later transported here to fill the sea."
Li Xuanfeng stood with his hands behind his back, listening silently. Understanding his nature, Ning Dingbo continued with the introduction on his behalf, "In those days, this area was home to the six most densely populated southern prefectures, all of which were swallowed by the sea… leaving ruins beneath the waves. Since the water is shallow, cultivators have already scoured it clean over the years."
Ning Dingbo continued to explain patiently, "If you travel further, toward the Scarlet Pristine Sea and the Qunyi Gorge, you will reach what was once the Eastern Sea… Dragon Palaces cover the landscape, with flood dragons and serpents roaming freely. Going deeper, you will encounter many dragon kin; do not offend them!"
The disciples reacted with mixed expressions. Those dressed in fine robes seemed unaffected, already familiar with this knowledge, while the more simply dressed disciples looked enlightened.
Ning Dingbo continued, "The Scarlet Pristine Sea was named after the eighth child of the True Hornless Dragon, which involves the ancient Pristine Converging Water. The sea is filled with demons and treasures, most of which are controlled by the dragon kin. If you go in, proceed with caution."
A young man with a finely tailored robe and slender brows suddenly spoke up, respectfully asking, "May I ask, Instructor, why is it that… while the ruling beings here are of the dragon kin and hold the Converging Water Fruition Attainment, it is referred to as the True Hornless Dragon? Why not call it the Hornless Dragon?"
"Well…" Ning Dingbo hesitated, casting a reluctant glance at Li Xuanfeng before shaking his head, replying gravely, "That is an ancient matter… few would know the answer."
The group looked slightly disappointed, but then Li Xuanfeng stepped forward and spoke softly, "If not for the Pristine Converging Water, the True Hornless Dragon would have become a True Dragon."
Having spent years in the Southern Border, Li Xuanfeng had come across one or two of these ancient secrets.
He knew that Li Chejing had fallen victim to an old flood dragon in the Southern Border, so whenever he encountered snake or flood dragon-type demons in battle, he always tried to capture them alive and interrogate them for any information about the old flood dragon.
This old flood dragon, a well-known demon king in the Southern Border, was named Cen Lufu and cultivated the divine ability of Pristine Water. Supposedly also of dragon kin, Li Xuanfeng himself had harbored the same question as the young disciple, and he had eventually uncovered the answer through careful questioning.
As he began to speak, the young disciples looked up to him in admiration. The refined young man appeared somewhat bashful as he respectfully requested, "Daoist, may I trouble you for your explanation…"
Li Xuanfeng replied softly, "The True Hornless Dragon dominated the Eastern Sea, achieving Fruition Attainment for hundreds of years, and reportedly reached the peak of the Dao Embryo Realm. It believed itself to be the most perfect creature under Heaven, and called itself the Demon Emperor, establishing the Eastern Sea Demon Palace."
"It journeyed westward until it reached a small mountain temple and encountered an Immortal Lord…" Li Xuanfeng continued, "The True Hornless Dragon asked, Is there any creature under Heaven with a form more perfect than my own? The Immortal Lord replied, The dragon kin rise and fall in size, soaring through the universe, diving beneath waves, and transforming with the times. You are merely a demon dragon; you must transform into a true dragon."
Li Xuanfeng paused, then continued softly, "The Hornless Dragon carefully questioned the Immortal Lord about the characteristics of true dragon kin, then returned to the Eastern Sea, gathering forces and consuming a feathered serpent."
"With two Fruition Attainments in one body, it was impossible to manage both Converging Water and Pristine Water simultaneously. It eventually met a hasty end, its powers divided among its nine offspring, throwing the Eastern Sea into turmoil and an era of extreme chaos."
Li Xuanfeng gazed into the distance, a hint of reverence in his voice as he added quietly, "Only then did the world's demons understand the difference between the Hornless and True Dragon, as well as those between flood dragons, snakes, and vipers—knowledge that later spread from the Dragon Palace itself."
"The Hornless Dragon may have been devoured by its nine offspring, but its descendants now call themselves dragon kin and have established the Eastern Sea Serpent Dragon Palace."
As Li Xuanfeng finished relating the story, not only were the disciples in awe, but even the Ning brothers were hearing this for the first time, marveling at the tale.
Li Xuanfeng shook his head.
"It is just a tale spun from the mouth of a mere snake; take it as a story for entertainment."
"Thank you, Daoist, for your teaching!" the disciples said in unison as they respectfully offered their thanks.
Li Xuanfeng waved it off, his eyes glinting with a cold light as he stared at the shadow approaching on the northern wind, murmuring, "Speak of the devil… here they come!"
Indeed, two streaks of light approached in the distance, one large and one small. The creature in the lead was snake-like, with a twin-hooked tail in a pale white hue, trailing a streak of blood across the sky. The one following closely behind it was nearly twice as large and was covered in bluish-gray scales, with a body resembling a tiger's but with an unusually elongated torso and belly, gliding in a prowling stance.
The bluish-gray creature had four strong legs, with an elongated torso and a long tail trailing behind, giving it an unusual appearance. It followed the white snake ahead of it with an air of ease, almost like a cat toying with a mouse.
Ning Dingbo glanced over and quickly directed his brother to steer the jade ship further away, lowering his voice as he said, "That is a dragon scion… Quickly move away… Do not disturb it."
Li Xuanfeng studied the scene closely. The creature in front seemed to be of the feathered serpent clan, with a twin-hooked tail. It was likely a hooked serpent.
Its scales were broken, blood that was a pale blue hue dripped from its body, and its window-sized eyes were filled with despair, emitting pitiful howls.
"It looks like it has been injured by Converging Water! Even if it escapes, it will not live much longer…"
Everyone watched, entranced, as the Ning brothers hastened to put distance between them and the scene. Yet, they could not help but look back in curiosity as the dragon scion closed in on the white hooked serpent, delaying the kill to toy with it instead.
Ning Dingbo's expression shifted slightly, muttering a quiet curse and silently quickening their pace, thinking to himself, Truly typical of dragon kin… The Converging Water lineage loves playing such games… Regardless of kin, they always have to test each other.
The group of cultivators watched the scene with rapt attention, awestruck, as the hooked serpent wailed miserably. After a few breaths, a faint green rain began to fall from the sky.
The rain was translucent and a delicate shade of blue-greenish hue. Though its color was light, it drenched the area and cast the world into a misty haze.
A finely dressed young disciple activated his mana to shield himself, remarking, "This is the vision of a fallen Converging Water Foundation Establishment Realm… So this is the Eastern Sea, where a Foundation Establishment Realm expert can fall on any stretch of ocean just like that."
Li Xuanfeng, meanwhile, was reflecting on the aura and appearance of the dragon scion they had just seen, thinking to himself, Indeed, they are unique. The dragon kin of the Eastern Sea must have various spells at their disposal; defeating them would likely be no easy task… If I could lure one into a wide enough sea area, perhaps I could exhaust it to death.
Naturally, he would not provoke a dragon kin, but he was calculating the strength of both sides, forming a solid understanding of the two.
Ning Dingbo moved a step closer and whispered, "Boss, I doubt that dragon scion's appearance here is just a coincidence; it is likely here to see who Azure Pond has sent to oversee Splitreed Island."
Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly. His task was not only to escort but also to stay on the island for a year or so to manage affairs. Splitreed Island's situation was complicated, so a dragon scion's curiosity was understandable.
