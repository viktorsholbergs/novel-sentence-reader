Lu Jiangxian sat down in front of the stone table, picking up a jade pot and a few jade cups from underneath it. He condensed a pot of bright, shimmering tea with Supreme Yin Moonlight, and began to drink slowly… without any particular purpose.
After a few sips, Lu Jiangxian's ears twitched as the void in front of him suddenly cracked open.
Out flew a round, shiny white pellet. It was round and luminous, its white light flashing and illuminating the mountaintop in a vast expanse of white.
"A talisman seed... Who is it?!" Lu Jiangxian frowned, catching the talisman seed in his hand.
He examined it closely for a while and said in a deep voice, "Foundation Establishment Realm… it seems to be Li Chejing. Looks like only one out of the four sons of the Li family from back then remains…"
Bringing the bright and white talisman seed closer to his nose, Lu Jiangxian gently inhaled, and strands of misty white light seeped into his body through his nostrils. Many scenes flashed before his eyes—Qingsui Peak, Mount Azure Pond, Yi Mountain City, the southern border...
"Looks like it's really that child! What a pity... But this Chi Wei, his name sounds very familiar." After pondering carefully, Lu Jiangxian finally had a realization.
He recalled that he had once come across a secret letter while exploring the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche, written by this mysterious Chi Wei to an unnamed cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm, asking him to join in attacking Li Jiangqun.
"If you are dead, it would be better; if not, with new grudges added to old, there will come a day when we must settle our scores."
Lu Jiangxian recounted these words, sighing softly.
With the power of his cultivation and divine sense rising sharply after integrating the mirror fragment and consuming the talisman seed, combined with the might of the Supreme Yin Moonlight elevated to the Foundation Establishment Realm, the number of Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds reached nine.
He raised his partly ethereal hands, and with a grasp in the void, a pale green halo condensed out of thin air.
"The lifelong experience and swordsmanship of Li Chejing..." Lu Jiangxian whispered as Supreme Yin Moonlight surged out, merging with this wisp of halo to condense into a pale green sword.
Lu Jiangxian admired it for a while, then casually planted it into a nearby boulder before continuing, "Waiting for someone destined."
As his magical power surged, an array of formations and talismanic techniques materialized. Lu Jiangxian revisited the shamanic spell he had studied years ago, using it to pass the time.
Li Xuanfeng and Jiang Yunu did it more than a dozen times, each time more at ease and enjoyable than the last.
However, Li Xuanfeng was still not satisfied and Jiang Yunu's round face had turned deathly pale with fine beads of sweat gathering above her cupid's bow.
"Dear… sweetheart, please spare me!" she pleaded.
Li Xuanfeng paused slightly and laughed awkwardly before kissing her on the eyebrows.
"How much silver do you need to redeem yourself?"
Seeing the incredulous look on Jiang Yunu's face, Li Xuanfeng thought to himself, I don't have much secular money in my storage pouch, just the thousand taels I brought from home… I wonder if that's enough.
The Li Family did not have much silver in reserve, as silver was hardly needed for immortal cultivation. They only needed a bit of silver powder at most for pill concoctions, tool crafting, and talisman drawing. Hence, there was almost no reserve for silver in his storage pouch, and he was worried that it might not be enough for her redemption.
Jiang Yunu raised her arched eyebrows, her cute round face full of tension and her complexion pale.
"I'm just a... courtesan. It takes twenty taels of silver."
Her voice was soft, quiet.
"All right," Li Xuanfeng nodded in empathetic understanding.
Jiang Yunu sat on the bed, naked and incredulous, thinking Li Xuanfeng was joking with her. "Young Master... don't play games with me!" she muttered, slightly embarrassed.
Li Xuanfeng fastened his belt, took down the pitch-black longbow from the wall, and shook his head in response.
"Pack your clothes and luggage. Let's go."
Jiang Yunu was stunned, but it did not take her long before she quickly grabbed her clothes, joyfully dressed, and pulled him downstairs. She was almost a different person now, hopping and laughing ahead—finally showing the innocent and cute side of a teenage girl.
Li Xuanfeng smiled to himself and followed her.
Upon reaching the counter, they saw a slightly plump woman dressed in red and green sitting in front. She was busy filing her nails and merely glanced up to shoot a disdainful glance at Jiang Yunu before turning her head away.
"I want to redeem her." Li Xuanfeng declared.
It was not until then that the woman looked up in surprise before her eyes narrowed coldly at Jiang Yunu once more.
"I wondered why you looked so pleased with yourself… Turns out you've found a rich patron, eh? You thought you could just leave without telling 'Mother'?"
Jiang Yunu's round face turned deathly pale, unsure of where to rest her hands. Li Xuanfeng frowned and said firmly, "I am redeeming her!"
The woman raised her head and glanced at Li Xuanfeng, taking in his appearance. Seeing that he was only about fifteen or sixteen but carried a certain demeanor—possibly that of a Young Master from some family, her attitude became much more respectful.
"Young Master... Do you know that this Drunken Spring Pavilion is owned by the county magistrate? Ordinary families cannot simply redeem people here. Do you have any friends from the clans who can come to redeem her?"
The woman spoke rather politely, referring not to the four great clans of Xiao, Wu, Ma, and Chang, but to the secular branches of these prestigious clans.
Li Xuanfeng, not wanting to waste more time on her, flicked his finger in annoyance. Almost instantly, the massive wooden table in front of him disintegrated into dust under the impact of his true essence, covering and dirtying the woman completely.
"Do not make me say it a third time!" he growled.
Both Jiang Yunu and the woman were stunned. The woman's legs gave out and she kneeled, slapping herself twice across the face with such force that she knocked out two of her teeth, leaving her face bloody and red.
"L-Lord Immortal, please take her away! Just take her away! I was blind not to recognize an immortal! I was…"
Without bothering to listen, Li Xuanfeng tossed two silver ingots at her before taking the shock-stricken Jiang Yunu by the hand and walking out.
The poor girl trembled and was too scared to even look up at him, having grown fearful after witnessing his power.
It was not until Li Xuanfeng bought a manor and entered the small courtyard and placed her on the bed that Jiang Yunu spoke again.
"... Are you an immortal?"
"An immortal cultivator," Li Xuanfeng corrected her before beginning to undo her sash.
Jiang Yunu blushed shyly but was too scared to resist his advances.
"I... c-can't..."
Li Xuanfeng paused, looking at the girl's cutely round face, suddenly realizing that the situation had become complicated.
How should I deal with this woman in the future? It's not like I can return to the town in a few days and tell Second Uncle that I went out and bought a prostitute! Second Uncle has always seen me as the hope of the next generation for our family; how can I let him worry?!
Li Xuanfeng, fearless in everything else and known for his libertine ways, was only afraid of disappointing Li Tongya and neglecting his family's affairs. He hesitated for a moment with furrowed brows.
Seeing his expression, Jiang Yunu timidly asked, "What's wrong, Immortal Master?"
"Call me Xuanfeng."
Li Xuanfeng shook his head, feeling somewhat embarrassed. He kissed her on the eyebrow and said, "My family has strict rules; I fear... I cannot take you back home. You'll have to endure some hardship..."
Jiang Yunu was stunned by his words, deeply moved by his care and consideration. Tears formed in her eyes, and her voice was hoarse when she spoke.
"I'm aware of my own lowly status… surely you are an immortal from the high heavens. I cannot hope for anything! You need not worry so; if you return to the heavens to cultivate, I will wait here in this courtyard… be it five years, ten years… I will wait until you come back to see me."
Li Xuanfeng frowned, disliking such tearful talk.
Never mind, let her stay here. Going back and forth is just a matter of a few hours; it won't be a problem.
Thus, he undid Jiang Yunu's clasps and began to caress her gently. He held her soft and pale hand while Jiang Yunu nestled quietly in his arms.
"Damn! Even if I die tonight or tomorrow, I've lived enough and have no regrets!" he murmured to himself.
