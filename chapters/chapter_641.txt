Li Qinghong cultivated on the island for a while. With the Eastern Sea's Falling Water Rising Storm, her progress in cultivation was extraordinarily rapid—one day of cultivation here was worth three days elsewhere. She became so immersed in her swift growth in power that she lost track of time.
It wasn't until the formation array of her cave dwelling began to hum and vibrate that she slowly awoke from her meditation. Exhaling a breath of violet lightning, she glanced outside and noticed that someone had come to visit. Awakened so abruptly by the array, she felt a bit surprised.
"How strange," she murmured.
Leaving the cave, she saw Zong Yan waiting by the formation boundary. It appeared he had activated the array. Bowing deeply, he reported, "My Grace, a cultivator from an immortal sect has arrived. He is dressed in feathered robes and claims to be Li Xizhi from the north."
Zong Yan had never met Li Xizhi, so he simply described the visitor's appearance. Hearing this, Li Qinghong immediately stood up, a hint of urgency in her voice as she asked, "If it is Zhi'er who has come, why did not you invite him in?"
Zong Yan bowed again and explained, "I did invite him, but the young master refused to believe me and insisted on seeing you in person before entering."
Li Qinghong didn't mind the hesitation. She grabbed her spear, rose into the air, and left the formation. Outside, she saw a young man in feathered robes standing among the clouds, his multicolored light forming six radiant hues that shimmered beautifully.
"Auntie Qinghong!" he called out warmly.
The aunt and nephew greeted each other with enthusiasm, exchanging a few words to bridge the gap of years apart. Together, they descended from the sky. As Li Qinghong guided him down, Li Xizhi cast a thoughtful glance at someone nearby and asked, "Is this Monk Kongheng?"
"Indeed," she replied. "He is my household guest. Back in the marketplace, he even delivered a spirit fruit to you."
Li Qinghong introduced them. Kongheng lowered his head respectfully, but Li Xizhi scrutinized him carefully. Observing that there was no trace of demonic energy nor any strange auras behind his head, Li Xizhi courteously inquired, "Master Monk, to which lineage do you belong?"
Kongheng replied, "The Liao River Temple of Yan State… from the Liao River Dao lineage."
Li Xizhi raised an eyebrow, a faint smile playing on his lips as he asked further, "Among the Seven Dao of Yan State, the territory belongs to the Pure Joy of Compassion and Abhidharma Temple. Which branch are you from?"
Kongheng looked surprised but answered calmly, "You are well-informed, Benefactor. However, the Liao River predates the Seven Dao and does not belong to any of them."
"Oh, so you are from the ancient lineages," Li Xizhi said, visibly relaxing. "I see. Forgive my presumptions."
Though he seemed to have eased his suspicions, Li Xizhi avoided further questions and surveyed their surroundings. Li Qinghong laughed and said, "It is good that you have come. I captured a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic beast. You can accompany me back home."
Understanding her intent, Li Xizhi made a quick calculation of time and replied, "I just returned from Green Pine Island. Although everything there has been arranged, I cannot stay away for too long. If we are heading home, we must leave immediately."
True to her straightforward nature, Li Qinghong promptly stored her spear and stepped into the central pool of the island. With a firm grip, she hoisted up half a figure—it was the haggard remnant of an old man with a hooked nose. Bound tightly in iron chains, he appeared dazed and insensible.
"Let us go!" she said decisively.
The two departed the formation. After a brief hesitation, Li Xizhi remarked, "If the family has placed their trust in him, I will say no more. As long as it is certain that he is an ancient cultivator, he can still be relied upon."
Li Qinghong nodded and, recalling their earlier exchange, asked, "The Seven Dao of northern Buddhist cultivators—what sort of Dao lineages are they?"
Shaking his head, Li Xizhi explained, "It is very complicated. Buddhist cultivators' doctrines differ greatly, with some even diverging as far as Purple Mansion Dao and shamanic talismans."
"Take Wrathful Purification of the World for example," he continued. "Then there is the Murong Clan's Pure Joy of Compassion, which our family has encountered before. Add to that the Abhidharma Temple, which teaches the belief that all is illusion except for a singular essence, and the Great Mahayana Dharma Realm, which claims that the present world is the Pure Land. Their conflicts are intense."
At this point, a look of puzzlement crossed his face as he added, "To these Buddhist cultivators, internal rivalries often seem more pressing than any southern expeditions."
Li Xizhi shared some intelligence he had learned within the sect before switching topics to Green Pine Island. With a sigh, he said, "Green Pine Island is currently caught up in a scramble for resources. Many Heavy Abyssal Gale have descended there, likely leaking from the grotto heaven. When I arrived, everyone was arguing over how to divide these treasures."
The two conversed about recent events, exchanging insights into their respective lives. Li Xizhi gained a deeper understanding of family matters, while Li Qinghong also benefited from the discussion. Together, they rode the wind toward Yue State, where the northern rain continued to drizzle relentlessly.
Li Xizhi took a long, thoughtful look at the scene and murmured, "The sect's explanation is that this rain is caused by Falling Water Rising Storm in the overseas regions. There may be some truth to it."
Li Qinghong, having personally witnessed the True Monarchs of the Yue Cultivating Sect intervene and isolate the celestial phenomena offshore, felt clear-headed about the matter. However, it was not something she could openly discuss with her nephew. She thought to herself, A convenient excuse!
At Qingdu Peak.
Li Chengliao had been busy for months with family affairs and barely had time to check on the family's auspicious child. The constant dampness caused by the rains had turned life into a living nightmare, leaving him and others frustrated beyond words.
Years of soaking rain had ruined the soil—black soil turned to yellow, and yellow turned to white. Forests rotted in large patches, and cliffs transformed into small lakes filled with black poison, utterly devoid of vitality.
Not to mention, wooden beams had rotted and collapsed in large swathes, leaving entire areas in ruins. The commoners, accustomed to traveling through these regions for years, found their legs and feet festering and rotting away from the damp conditions. Though the Li Family had spent several consecutive years draining the floodwaters and managed to maintain relative peace within their domain, the chaos beyond their borders was unmistakable. Every day, one could see corpses drifting downstream along the river.
Li Chengliao observed the land for a long while. The Mushroom Forest Plain had completely transformed into a swamp, with catastrophic casualties.
The Azure Pond Sect had sent no aid. Perhaps, to them, this flood was no different from past droughts or conflicts—just another disaster that would claim lives but eventually recover within decades. Pressuring the Yue Cultivating Sect seemed to be the only priority.
"The Yue Cultivating Sect remains unmoved, and the Yuan Family continues to suffer..." Rising into the air, he surveyed the town from above. As he watched, a few figures flew toward him from the horizon.
The Jade Court Guards beside him quickly formed a protective formation. Li Chengliao looked closer and noticed the distinctive attire of the Xiao Family. Seeing that these people were heading straight for him, he kept his composure and prepared to respond.
At the forefront was a woman dressed in white. She appeared to be in her mid-thirties and exuded a dignified presence. With a cultivation level of a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm, her face seemed somewhat familiar.
Behind her stood a young man clad in black, his expression stern. Though he looked to be under thirty, his cultivation level had already reached the early stage of Qi Cultivation Realm. Li Chengliao recognized him immediately as Xiao Muyun, the heir of the Xiao Family's Mount Yu branch, who had paid respects when Li Yuanping passed away.
The group halted nearby. The woman stepped forward alone and asked, "I am Li Qingxiao of Mount Yu. May I ask which family member currently oversees the household?"
Li Chengliao stared for a moment, stunned, before he replied, "Greetings, Grandaunt."
