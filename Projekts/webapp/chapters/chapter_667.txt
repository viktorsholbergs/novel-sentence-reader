Yuan Hudu suppressed the panic in his heart and his mind went blank for a moment. After weighing the pros and cons, he immediately cupped his hands and said in a loud voice, "Yuan Hudu greets the general!"
Yuan Hudu feared that Li Xuanfeng would silently kill him and leave, so his voice instantly drowned out all the noise in the courtyard. Those drinking paused mid-cup and those offering congratulations fell silent. Everyone's eyes turned toward the stage and started whispering among themselves.
"Who is this... Has he come to offer congratulations? How could he receive such respectful treatment from Yuan Hudu?"
"He is a Foundation Establishment cultivator!"
"I'm afraid he comes with ill intent…"
As everyone's gaze shifted over, Li Xuanfeng simply stood with his arms crossed and his eyes gradually sharpened. His posture was straight, and his broad shoulders blocked out the light in front of Yuan Hudu completely.
His voice was low, and his tone was steady as he said, "I do not deserve the title of General from the head of the Yuan Family. I am merely serving in the southern border. Upon hearing that a child from my family has suffered grievances, I came to ask the head of the Yuan Family about it."
Though his voice was not loud, the courtyard had already fallen silent enough to hear a pin drop. The cultivators, with their keen senses, heard every word clearly. They exchanged glances, lowered their heads, and harbored different thoughts. Some were sneering, some were shocked, and some were worried for both families. But most of them simply reveled in the spectacle and watched coldly.
So he is from the Li Family!
From what he said… there must be more to this matter…
Li Xuanfeng’s name was well-known. Built on his record of slaying demons and men alike, as well as the stories spread by the direct disciples of the seven sects who had encountered him in grotto heavens and overseas.
He rarely acted within the mainland, so most people did not recognize his appearance or attire. But as soon as Li Xuanfeng mentioned the southern border and the title of General, everyone immediately realized who he was and thought to themselves in unison, It is the Golden Bowstring, Li Xuanfeng... the divine bow of the southern border!
Yuan Fuyao's face turned pale as he silently retreated into the crowd. He had long heard the rumors of an annulled engagement between the two families, but what could he do? Yuan Hudu had repeatedly assured him there was no need to worry. Yet, he found himself more confused than ever as he looked at the elderly man in black-golden armor standing above.
Sweat appeared on Yuan Hudu’s forehead as his very life was at stake now. He could no longer afford to speak harshly, but if he yielded, he would have offended not only the Li Family but also the Chi Family. The entire act he had staged would be for nothing. Left with no choice, he exhaled deeply and remained silent.
Seeing Yuan Hudu's silence, Li Xuanfeng spoke softly, "Your esteemed family fabricated momentum and humiliated my family for no reason. Out of respect for our past ties, my elder brother wished to avoid further conflict and spare our predecessors from disgrace. But I do not have such magnanimity. This matter cannot simply be let go."
Yuan Hudu barely managed to meet his gaze and saw the sharpness in the old general’s eyes. The eyes were piercing and full of warning, yet held littleanger, as if to say, Alright, if you want to show the Chi Family where you stand, I’ll make sure they see it clearly!
Yuan Hudu understood that this matter could not be settled peacefully. Recalling his elder brother Yuan Huyuan’s warning, he let out a slow sigh and replied, "What does the general intend to do?"
Li Xuanfeng lightly brushed the black-golden beast-head ornament at his waist, and a large bow appeared in his hand. Yuan Hudu’s eyelids twitched at the sight. The people below the platform instinctively shrank back, taking a collective step backward.
It was simply because the longbow was too terrifying. The golden bow measured around eight chi in length, with limbs around three chi and five cun long. It shimmered in golden and crimson hues, radiating an intense aura. It was as if the energy of countless slain men and monsters surged within it, making it an unmistakable weapon of death.
The cultivators below slowly backed away, finally grasping the terror hidden behind Yuan Hudu’s sweat-drenched face. Hearing a name was never the same as witnessing its power firsthand. With a fight between Foundation Establishment cultivators on the verge of breaking out, some took their leave, cupping their hands in farewell. However, most could not suppress their curiosity and chose to stay and watch in silence.
The head of the Song Family cautiously moved away in fear as he was merely at the late stage of Qi Cultivation. Li Xuanfeng, however, only fixed his gaze on Yuan Hudu as he rasped, "I offer the family head two choices."
He slowly leveled the longbow, and the quiver at his waist let out a crisp, metallic clang. He said, "I understand that the family head is cautious, always traveling with cultivators for protection. You may try and see whether the Foundation Establishment cultivator and the demon hiding in the mountains can keep you safe together. But once this profound arrow is loosed, it will undoubtedly draw blood."
Yuan Hudu never expected that Li Xuanfeng had already seen through his preparations so clearly. Fear crept into his heart as the metallic objects in the courtyard began to tremble and rattle. Watching him drenched in sweat, Li Xuanfeng continued, "Second, out of respect for the bond between your esteemed family and my granduncle. I’ll give you the time of twenty breaths to prepare and take just one shot of an arrow from me. After that, all grievances between our families will be settled, and the matter will be put to rest!"
Yuan Hudu secretly exhaled, realizing that Li Xuanfeng was ultimately sparing his life. This arrow was likely meant as a display for the Chi Family. He thought to himself, Li Xuanfeng, no matter how formidable you are, can the power of just one arrow truly be so overwhelming?
But even though he understood the limits of his opponent’s intentions, he did not dare provoke him further. Instead, he cupped his hands and replied, "Please, General, release your arrow."
Seeing Li Xuanfeng nod, Yuan Hudu wasted no time in riding the wind into the sky. Two talismans burned rapidly within his sleeves, streaking away like comets. The two protective shields on his body shimmered brilliantly, appearing exceptionally sturdy.
Li Xuanfeng mirrored his movement, drawing his bow and nocking an arrow. A golden-red spirit arrow leaped from the quiver, and golden light burst forth from the longbow, illuminating the surroundings. The polished stone tiles on the ground gleamed, reflecting a hazy golden glow.
Buzz… buzz…
Everyone felt as if their faces were being slashed by blades. The fine wine and delicacies on the tables trembled violently, creating a chorus of clinking sounds. The golden brilliance flowing across Li Xuanfeng’s armor grew even more intense as he slowly ascended into the sky.
The arrow on his longbow was the very same one that was refined through the Six Ding Merging Fire Token and the Binding Ring. Now meticulously reforged and inscribed with intricate array patterns, it radiated dazzling brilliance, unleashing streams of Astral Qi.
After precisely counting to twenty breaths, the cultivators in the courtyard had already retreated beyond its perimeter. Li Xuanfeng released his fingers.
Buzz…
Boom!
The jade cups and jade wine jugs on the tables exploded with a loud crack, sending shards and gleaming wine splattering through the air like a rainstorm. The courtyard was swept by a violent gust, toppling tables and chairs into complete disarray.
The falling debris forced the spectators to raise their sleeves in defense, but their spiritual senses had long since locked onto the golden bow. Yet, at that moment, they all felt an eerie void within their senses. They were unable to grasp anything at all through their spiritual senses.
"So fast."
The golden arrow had already vanished without a trace. With no other choice, the crowd turned their eyes toward the distant sky, where a dark figure plummeted like a bird with broken wings. Realizing that Li Xuanfeng had disappeared from sight, they exchanged uneasy glances
"Huh?!"
Li Xuanfeng had not been arrogant; his profound arrow was no ordinary projectile. Even if it wasn't paired with his golden bow, it remained a true Foundation Establishment dharma artifact.
Having undergone refinement through Merging Fire, the profound arrow could retain Astral Qi for long periods and be pre-charged with golden Astral Qi. Since Yuan Hudu’s Immortal Foundation, cultivation method, and realm were all inferior to his, Li Xuanfeng was confident that this single arrow would be enough to awe the spectators and wash away his past humiliation.
With the arrow loosed, he naturally activated a spell, drifting eastward with the wind.
"Quick! Save the family head!"
Everyone feared that Yuan Hudu might die on the spot. The head of the Song Family, utterly terrified, hastily took to the skies. The crowd scattered like a storm clearing away the clouds, vanishing entirely. Only Yuan Fuyao and a few others remained in the courtyard, standing there in bewilderment.
