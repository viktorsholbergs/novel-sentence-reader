Yuan Huyuan deliberated for a moment, his voice lowering as he said, "Now… if both Chengdun and the others do not return, the future will be hard to predict. Fuyao is Chengdun's only son. I can only entrust him to your family's care."
"This was something Chengdun arranged with you earlier…"
Yuan Huyuan's expression became increasingly strained. His aged face twitched slightly, and he finally said, "I have come here today, swallowing my pride, to ask if your family can spare a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator to assist us…"
Li Xuanxuan was stunned, momentarily at a loss for words.
Thanks to Li Xizhi's earlier reminder, he already understood that the Yuan Family was in chaos, unsure of how deeply involved they were with Azure Pond Sect's plans. He had no intention of getting entangled.
While offering protection to Yuan Chengdun's descendants was a minor matter that wouldn't pose significant risks, actively intervening was an entirely different issue.
Being a cautious individual by nature, Li Xuanxuan only wanted to protect the family's prodigy for a few more years. The difficulty of the situation was clearly written on his face. Seeing this, Yuan Huyuan lowered his voice further and said, "I understand the trouble with Yuanjiao's situation and that your family is facing turbulent times… but as for my family…"
Yuan Huyuan understood his family's precarious situation all too well. Yet, as an elder, he desperately clung to the hope of salvaging what remained, unwilling to give up. Having exhausted every possible connection, he could only turn to the Li Family for help.
Li Xuanxuan sighed inwardly and decided to hint at his position. "Senior! This rain has lasted far too long!"
The words hit Yuan Huyuan like a bolt of lightning. He stepped back, realizing the Li Family was well aware of the Yuan Family's current state: the death of their ancestor Yuan Licheng, the disappearance of their backer Buzi, and their transformation into a pawn of Azure Pond Sect in their maneuvering against Yue Cultivating Sect. The risks were too great for the Li Family to intervene. With a bitter smile, he replied, "Very well… I can only entrust Fuyao to your care."
Li Xuanxuan offered some comfort. "Your family has deep roots. You will weather this storm."
Yuan Huyuan remained silent. Being at the eye of the storm left him little to say. He cupped his fist and took his leave.
Meanwhile, Li Yuexiang excused herself from the gathering. Yuan Fuyao walked alongside her as they exited the hall and sighed, "Watching them trade polite pleasantries feels so meaningless!"
Li Yuexiang lowered her gaze, blinking slightly, and responded, "Our two families have had a long-standing alliance. Naturally, there is much to discuss."
Yuan Fuyao nodded quickly, adopting an agreeable stance.
In truth, Yuan Fuyao had not been in a good mood during the journey. He was strongly opposed to the idea of an arranged marriage. However, Yuan Huyuan's authority was absolute, leaving him with no room to argue, and he begrudgingly accompanied the elder.
Along the way, he calculated ways to extricate himself. After all, the marriage had not been finalized yet. If he could find some excuse—such as incompatible personalities—it might still be possible to withdraw.
But as soon as he laid eyes on Li Yuexiang, he was utterly captivated. Her beauty was otherworldly, and all his grievances vanished like smoke. He stared at her, nodding repeatedly, his earlier thoughts entirely forgotten. He silently marveled, What a stunning woman! Such beauty is rare, even among cultivators!
Li Yuexiang appeared unaware of his admiration. She guided him across the lake, making casual conversation. Suddenly, Yuan Fuyao noticed the large dam spanning the lake and asked with some curiosity, "What is this for? Raising spirit fish?"
Li Yuexiang answered gently, "It is to block the lake water and protect the people."
Yuan Fuyao sighed repeatedly and said, "My family is far behind yours in this regard. With this endless rain, I have suggested several times to my family that we send cultivators to help manage things in the plains. But they always dismiss it as a waste of manpower."
It turned out that Yuan Fuyao, under Yuan Chengdun's arrangement, had been managing towns and commoners in Mushroom Forest Plain. With this opening, he began discussing matters of governance in detail—how to regulate livelihoods, manage the populace, and ensure their welfare. His insights were surprisingly profound.
Hearing this, Li Yuexiang nodded internally, though her expression remained calm and pleasant. She responded with a soft smile, "Cultivators may not fear the rain, but the people by the lake suffer greatly."
Yuan Fuyao had a moment of realization and, while his face betrayed no change, he thought, The Li Family's reputation for caring for its people is well-deserved.
Li Yuexiang had little interest in discussing such topics further. She redirected the conversation to inquire about recent news. Yuan Fuyao enthusiastically shared various tales and observations, speaking at length about distant lands and scattered events. Li Yuexiang listened politely without much engagement.
Suddenly, he asked, "Did my father leave any message or item for me when he visited your family?"
Li Yuexiang narrowed her eyes slightly, thinking to herself, It seems Yuan Chengdun went straight to the Eastern Sea without leaving any instructions for his family…
Without any intention of keeping the betrothal gifts for herself, she replied softly, "He did leave a betrothal gift. It is in the central hall. You may ask Senior Huyuan about it."
She hadn't expected that her words would cause Yuan Fuyao, who had been reserved and deferential, to suddenly straighten his back and lift his chin slightly. Confidence seemed to fill him, and he responded with a simple "Hmm."
The two chatted a while longer until Yuan Huyuan emerged from the hall, accompanied by a retinue. He addressed Yuan Fuyao, saying, "You will stay here to cultivate for now. For any matters, consult Yuexiang."
Yuan Fuyao seemed a bit caught off guard and could only nod blankly. Yuan Huyuan gave a polite smile to Li Yuexiang and then flew away on the wind.
Yuan Fuyao's cave dwelling had already been prepared. Li Yuexiang escorted him and his attendants there and quickly took her leave. Once inside, Yuan Fuyao instructed his attendants to inspect the dwelling, then sat down to drink tea.
On his left, one of his trusted aides asked, "Young Master, what do you think of the Li Family's young lady?"
Yuan Fuyao paused for a moment before praising, "She is truly a beauty, but she is also full of schemes."
The aide leaned in and asked quietly, "Full of schemes…?"
Yuan Fuyao nodded with some difficulty and said, "I have heard that she has an older brother cultivating within the sect who has already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. If I marry her, I am afraid my branch will only end up obeying the Li Family's commands."
The aides exchanged glances, unsure how to respond. They dared not speak ill of the woman from the Li Family. If she were to truly become their mistress and inquire into such matters, the consequences would not be light. Suddenly, Yuan Fuyao spoke again in a low voice, "Go and find out how much my father prepared for the Li Family. See if there is any way to reclaim it."
The aide quickly excused himself, while Yuan Fuyao remained seated, pondering silently. "I need to find a way to retrieve those resources. I cannot keep living under the Li Family's shadow, with everything falling into their hands."
Meanwhile, Li Yuexiang had returned. Li Xuanxuan soon came to find her, having just finished receiving updates. He hurried over, determined to assess matters for his granddaughter. Upon seeing Li Yuexiang enter, he quickly asked, "How was it?"
Li Yuexiang waved her hand dismissively and, seeing that her grandfather didn't appear overly concerned, replied, "This Yuan Fuyao seems to understand the needs of the common people. Beyond that, he is rather glib and seems to possess a bit of cleverness. His personality, however, leans toward mediocrity and greed. That said, his actions appear to remain within the bounds of propriety. Whether it is genuine or merely a façade, I will need to observe him further."
"What?!" Li Xuanxuan was taken aback and blurted, "How can he be like that! Are you sure you have judged him correctly?"
Li Yuexiang, relying on her own observations, began to feel slightly uncertain under her grandfather's questioning. She responded hesitantly, "I have not met too many people while on the mountain, so perhaps my assessment is not entirely accurate. It is just unfortunate that my brother is in seclusion…"
Li Xuanxuan waved his hand dismissively and said, "That makes it easier. I will have Li Chengliao and the others test him. There is no need for you to deal with this yourself."
