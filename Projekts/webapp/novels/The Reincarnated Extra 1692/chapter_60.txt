The Baron’s Household in Sudden Grave Peril
* * *
The next day.
In the early morning before sunrise.
The rain was still falling steadily, though with less intensity. I wandered absentmindedly through the dimly lit forest behind the mansion.
Swish.
At this hour, I was not assigned to guard Sara.
Since the roofing board incident, the Baron, the Lady, and Sara-chan have been sleeping in the same room together.
The reason my early morning free time was secured is because the Baron himself is quite capable in battle.
Or rather, if I didn’t have this free time, it would be troubling.
If I don’t stock up during this time, the whole day becomes unbearably difficult.
Swish.
Since Sara-chan invited me to go to the academy with her yesterday,
I haven’t been able to concentrate. My mind is distracted and muddled.
I can’t sort out my feelings.
Swish.
Sara-chan is my friend.
I didn’t realize it, but apparently Sara-chan has been my friend.
And that friend invited me to stay together from now on.
I’m very happy about that.
Swish.
Let me recall my life’s goal.
It was “to eat delicious food in a warm home together with Extra-sama.”
…Come to think of it, now that I’ve been employed at the Baron’s household, you could say that goal has already been achieved.
I’m able to eat food made by human hands while sheltered indoors from the wind and rain.
If I accept Sara’s invitation, this happiness can continue from now on.
Swish.
But, but, I also think to myself, is that really enough?
Because with such a lukewarm life, I won’t be able to grow stronger.
Going to the academy with Sara would be an experience, but……
Would I really be able to become as strong as my master that way?
Swish.
I’ve heard the academy is located in the capital of this country.
Life there is surely even more confining than here.
I wouldn’t be able to train in the forest or freely hunt for snacks.
Could I endure such a lifestyle?
Swish.
How do I want to live my life going forward?
Swish.

<…Emi! Emi! Hey! Listen to me Emi!>
……Huh? What? What is it, Extra-sama?
<Phew, you finally heard me! Emi, you were spacing out way too much! Look around you!>
Prompted by Extra-sama, I survey my surroundings.
There were headless topopolock corpses scattered all across the forest floor. Corpses, corpses, corpses……
Oh? There are lots of snacks lying around? Yay?
It seems I had unconsciously been hunting any topopolock I spotted.
I pick up a nearby topopolock corpse and munch munch munch……
Gulp.
Hey, wait?
…………There are way too many topopolock corpses, aren’t there?
<You’re a bit slow on the uptake, Emi! I’ve been trying to warn you over and over again, but you just…!>
“Migyaa! Migyaa! Migyaa!”
“Migya gyagyagyagyagya gyaa!”
“Migyaaaaaaaaaaa!”
Oh jeez!? My apologies Extra-sama, the lecture can wait!
Shaking the bushes, a new swarm of topopolock emerges, charging right at us.
Around 10 of them.
I mow them down with a barrage from 【Infinite Pebbles】 for now.
“Migyaaaaa! Mimmigya aa!”
“Migyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
But the topopolock cries echoing throughout the forest don’t stop!
Looking closely in the dim forest, their red third eyes are glowing all around.
<This is clearly an abnormal number! An emergency situation has occurred! A topopolock stampede has broken out, we should respond accordingly!>
St,stampede!? What’s that!?
<A frenzied mass movement! Due to the continuous rain, their habitats were likely flooded or destroyed by a landslide…the cause is unclear, but at this rate, the topopolock will overflow from the forest! And the first place to suffer the consequences will be…>
The Baron’s mansion right next to the forest!?
<Fortunately, this is still the initial stage of the stampede outbreak! If we take countermeasures like strengthening the barrier now, we can minimize the damage!>
Got it, so what I need to do right now is……!
<Report to Baron Martz!>
……Understood!
Kicking off the ground and tree trunks, I dash back towards the Baron’s mansion at full speed.
Using this sprinting technique applying 【Grasshopper】, I can currently move at speeds comparable to a car on a highway in my previous life.
As a result, the raindrops pelt my body with bullet-like force, but I endure it by using 【Body Strengthening】.
The mansion comes into view in just a few minutes.
There don’t seem to be any topopolock flooding out around here yet.
<We’ve just barely made it in time, it seems?>
Alright, hurry!
I’ll get the mansion a bit dirty with my soaked, bloody, muddy appearance, but I’ll give it a thorough cleaning later so I’ll have to ask them to forgive me.
<At this hour, Baron Martz should still be in the bedroom, right?>
Probably, yeah.
It’s unfortunate to have to disturb the family’s peaceful slumber, but this is an emergency.
I’ll have to wake them up.
With that thought, I took one step into the mansion’s entrance hall. At that moment.
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
A deafening sound rang out throughout the entire mansion.
……Eh? What is this?
<!! Emi! 【Magic Perception】!>
Urged by Extra-sama, I hastily activate 【Magic Perception】.
Hm?
Eh?
Ehhhhhhhhhhh!?
<The barrier protecting the mansion……has vanished!!>
……The Salar Baron’s household is in sudden grave peril.
