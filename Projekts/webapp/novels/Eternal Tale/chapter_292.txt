Yu Jingxin felt the world spinning as the teleportation arrays on one island after another lit up, transporting him across thousands of miles in an instant!
He saw a big black ox tirelessly activating formation after formation as if it had been preparing these for ages in various locations.
Yu Jingxin’s pupils contracted sharply. For years, he had been plotting against them, yet... they had been preparing all along! They were not afraid.
A pressure of heaven and earth, infused with the five elements, bore down relentlessly on his primordial spirit. His expression grew increasingly painful. They had truly broken through to the Nascent Soul stage, but it was too late for regrets now.
The dark and boundless sky shrouded the black sea.
Within an abandoned mine pit on a desolate island in the Forbidden Sea’s Demon Nest.
Three figures faced off, tension crackling in the air. Yu Jingxin’s face was grim as though he faced an insurmountable foe—two Nascent Soul cultivators!
The suppressive force of the Forbidden Sea surged like a tide. Pointing a finger skyward, Yu Jingxin summoned a protective barrier before him.
Intricate and profound patterns instantly hovered around him. It was the secret technique of the Yu Clan, capable of withstanding the impact of the Forbidden Sea's will for an hour.
Glancing to his side, his eyes landed on a gravestone standing beside him: The Tomb of Long Guanzi.
The big black ox took a step forward, exhaling cold breath through its nostrils. Its eyes locked onto the Nascent Soul cultivator with murderous intent. Years ago, this very person had dared to attempt killing and plundering treasures.
For months, it and Little Red had prepared meticulously along the way, determined to leave no room for error, especially fearing that the teleportation formations might fail to suppress this Nascent Soul cultivator.
Now, Little Red had drawn the ancient warships away, following plans long laid, all for the purpose of annihilating this man.
The entire island was now a death formation, sealing heaven and earth. Even primordial spirits could not escape. Overwhelming spiritual pressure filled every corner; this was their battlefield, and anyone who entered would perish!
Yu Jingxin looked at the two black-clad figures before him and suddenly laughed. “As expected of Forbidden Sea cultivators, far exceeding my expectations.”
Doubts churned within his mind. How had they crossed the heavenly threshold to achieve breakthroughs? Where did this teleportation array, imbued with the power of the five elements, come from? And what was that stone...
Even with the knowledge of a Nascent Soul cultivator, he found himself dwarfed by the mysteries they controlled—secrets unimaginable to the cultivation world.
“Long Guanzi, this place will be your burial ground.”
Chen Xun sneered coldly, and one by one, primordial spirits emerged. Terrifying figures began materializing on the ground.
The big black ox glanced at Chen Xun, its body surging with divine light. More figures began to appear, their auras causing the elemental forces of heaven and earth to surge violently.
Twelve figures spread out in all directions, each exuding the overwhelming power of a Nascent Soul cultivator. They encircled Yu Jingxin completely.
No escape above or below!
Yu Jingxin scanned his surroundings, a rare solemnity in his gaze. The intricate patterns before him flickered erratically. Suddenly, the patterns stabilized, radiating an awe-inspiring aura that engulfed the area.
His eyes narrowed as he sensed a mysterious pressure—it was from cultivators who had mastered the five elements, not mere spiritual energy practitioners!
Yu Jingxin could no longer discern their true strength. Even his earlier perception of Chen Xun’s cultivation level had been a facade, simulated by the latter using the power of the five elements.
He pointed forward, and the intricate patterns instantly expanded. The booming resonance of tremendous magical power echoed across the island. An invisible ripple descended from the sky, hurtling toward the twelve figures!
The twelve figures struck simultaneously, instantly shattering the ripple. Yet, it offered no resistance.
The invisible ripple exploded outward, transforming into countless tiny vortices that enveloped the twelve figures. These figures, too, were consumed by the ripple!
“Still far from enough.”
Yu Jingxin remained remarkably composed. Their auras vanished in an instant, leaving behind only vague silhouettes. Even their primordial spirits were undetectable. “Unity of a Thousand Weight!”
As his voice fell, the intricate patterns morphed again. Blinding beams of light coalesced in the air, dazzling and radiant, sweeping outward in all directions.
The entire island was instantly enveloped by this overwhelming magical power, and a terrifying aura spread out, sending chills down one’s spine.
At this moment, the sky above the island turned bleak. Countless white beams of light fell from the heavens in an instant, each one seeming as heavy as a thousand stones, unbearable for any cultivator.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Yu Jingxin’s black hair whipped wildly as his hands clasped together, causing the entire island to shake violently. The surrounding Black Sea churned with towering waves, creating intense vibrations and earth-shattering roars.
But his heart tightened as he realized that he still couldn’t locate them. Their presence had completely vanished; not even their auras remained!
Just then, an earth-shattering change occurred!
Boom!
The island’s sky and earth seemed to change color. A terrifying oppressive force descended abruptly, completely locking onto Yu Jingxin. His face changed dramatically as if he were submerged at the bottom of an immeasurable sea.
“Not good!” Yu Jingxin suddenly shouted, turning to look in a particular direction.
Twelve figures shot across the sky like bolts of lightning. Facing the white beams, they showed no signs of retreating; instead, they struck back fiercely. The entire island trembled as if it were about to collapse at any moment.
At the same time, a deafening boom rang out!
Several black light pillars shot into the sky, piercing through the clouds like divine beings descending, instantly enveloping the entire island.
Yu Jingxin was fighting against twelve cultivators, and the prohibitions on the profound patterns were collapsing inch by inch, on the verge of disintegrating into dust.
He suddenly burst into wild laughter, no longer thinking about escape. The entire place was sealed by formations, and he had become a fish in a barrel. It was better to enjoy a spectacular battle.
“Brother Chen, do you dare to face me one-on-one?!”
“Old ox, let’s fight together!”
“Moo!”
Chen Xun and the big black ox gave no response. They had never harbored an invincible mindset, seeking to fight across the world to prove their superiority.
With the words barely spoken, the God-killing Storm swept across all directions. Yu Jingxin’s expression twitched as his vast magical power surged. All his hidden trump cards came into play!
In the blink of an eye, the island erupted in a roaring storm, and the battle intensified.
Little Red, standing by the shore, stared dumbfounded as more and more ancient warships gathered here. All of this was because he had snatched a ring from the surface, with Brother Ox leading the way.
This Nascent Soul cultivator truly was different from other Nascent Soul cultivators. His tricks and trump cards were many, but still, he could not inflict any significant harm to the two big brothers.
The battle unfolded in the blink of an eye, the victor becoming clear almost immediately, such was the overwhelming pressure.
Boom!
Twelve terrifying fist shadows blasted forward, resembling a mountain collapsing or a tsunami, unstoppable.
Each fist shadow was like the collapse of heaven and earth, with countless stones of various sizes flying up into the sky, their rumbling echoing across the island.
The entire island cracked and trembled as a mighty aura of the five elements spread, seemingly tearing the very world apart.
Yu Jingxin’s expression twisted as he looked up at the enormous fist shadows. He raised a finger, and the profound patterns rippled like water. Suddenly, they manifested, drawing upon the Black Sea’s primal energy to form a gigantic palm to block the blows!
Bang! Boom!
Yu Jingxin’s life-bound treasure was shattered by the fist shadows. He coughed up blood and was sent flying backward. However, something even more terrifying followed.
The world-shaking killing formation, the God-killing Storm, arrived instantly. He let out a blood-curdling scream, “Ah!!!”
His primordial spirit was immediately shredded by the God-killing Storm. His robes were torn apart, his hair was in disarray, and he collapsed to the ground, blood pouring from his wounds.
The surroundings were in ruins, and the place where he fell was coincidentally right in front of the gravestone.
Yu Jingxin was defeated. He was defeated too quickly, without any resistance. Even when surrounded by twelve Nascent Soul cultivators using the power of the five elements, his defeat was inevitable.
His life force quickly faded as his primordial spirit was obliterated by the God-killing Storm, leaving him utterly beyond saving.
