Torn between fear and hatred toward Xu Xiao, Chen Mufeng also felt a flicker of relief that he was dealing with Li Chengliao. Had it been Li Yuanping, he would have kicked him to the ground without a word, leaving no room for explanations.
Facing away from him, Li Chengliao struggled to contain his anger, "Kneeling will not help. Gather the men immediately and secure the Xu Family… Xu Xiao might not even know yet."
Chen Mufeng leaped to his feet instantly and dashed out the door. Li Chengliao's voice echoed after him, "If he escapes, do not bother coming back."
Chen Mufeng responded with urgency, disappearing into the distance. Meanwhile, Li Chengliao was plagued by unease, recalling the old matter with Chu Yi from Yufu Prefecture. He knew too many hidden truths, and his mind remained clear despite the circumstances—Xu Xiao was no Chu Yi.
"With the cautionary tales of the Kong Family and Chu Yi, I cannot afford to be careless."
Calling yet another attendant forward, he ordered, "Keep a close watch on the Liu Family, especially Liu Lingzhen."
At that moment, Li Chengliao abandoned any thoughts of saving face or fostering harmony. His mind was now consumed with fear and hatred. Wasting no time, he summoned the white monkey, and together they took to the skies, heading toward Mount Qingdu.
Upon arriving at the mountain, the hall stood empty except for a young woman seated in the courtyard, combing her hair. Her phoenix-like eyes and fine eyebrows gave her an elegant, noble appearance.
Seeing her, Li Chengliao's heart sank. With a grim expression, he greeted her, "Auntie."
Although Li Yuexiang was younger than him, her seniority was much higher. Noticing his anxious demeanor, she asked, "Why the rush? My brother has already entered seclusion."
Hearing that Li Xijun was in seclusion, Li Chengliao's heart sank further. Li Yuexiang continued, "He sensed an opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm a few days ago, so he hurried into seclusion. It is best not to disturb him."
This is bad!
Although Li Chengliao knew there was not much benefit in sharing all the details with Li Yuexiang, he still gave her a brief account of the situation.
After listening, Li Yuexiang set down her comb, her expression thoughtful.
"So, he carries a thread of fate within him… That is why our brother suddenly went into seclusion, and Grandfather and Elder Donghe led a group of Qi Cultivation Realm disciples eastward to congratulate Daoist Master Houfu, leaving us with weakened defenses?"
Her words sent a chill through Li Chengliao as it was only then did he realize that many of their key Qi Cultivators had gone east. He responded grimly, "Can the thread of fate truly be so potent? Could this not all just be a coincidence?"
Li Yuexiang tied up her hair and answered, "Let us not lose our composure. Before going into seclusion, Brother left me a jade. It can summon him. Do you want to try it?"
Li Chengliao nodded decisively and said in a low voice, "Please awaken Eighth Uncle. This matter is too important! It is better to err on the side of caution, even if it means striking preemptively… I will take full responsibility."
Li Yuexiang took a jade pendant from her sleeve and murmured, "Do not speak of taking responsibility like that."
With a light squeeze, she crushed the jade talisman into powder.
At the Qingdu Cave Dwelling.
Li Xijun, looking slightly pale, stepped out of the cave dwelling, where several people were already waiting for him. He scanned them briefly, took a letter, and one of the Jade Court Guards stepped forward, bowing respectfully, "My Lord. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has sent word… there seems to be trouble with Young Master Chengliao."
"Trouble with Chengliao..?" Li Xijun frowned. The Cheng and Ming generation of the Li Family were not particularly gifted, except for the promising young Li Chenghuai. The only other noteworthy member was Li Chengliao, who was known for being courteous and steady.
"What happened?" Li Xijun asked.
"It appears to involve a conflict with the Xu Family in town… all over a woman," the guard reported.
"What?!" Li Xijun's expression darkened. Chengliao had always conducted himself well on the mountain; he never expected him to cause such trouble the moment he went down to town. However, without more details, Li Xijun held back his judgment and said quietly, "We will put this matter aside for now. Summon Yuexiang."
He figured that Yuexiang's urgent summons had to mean something serious was unfolding. His thoughts immediately turned to the possibility that their elders overseas were in trouble, prompting the use of the jade talisman to request aid. A sense of unease weighed heavily on him.
As he was about to get up, another figure rushed in and reported, "My Lord, the young lady and young master are here to see you."
Li Xijun sat back down and gestured with his hand.
"Let them in."
Li Yuexiang and Li Chengliao hurriedly stepped forward but without fully grasping the situation, Li Xijun calmly invited them to sit. However, Chengliao did not even take the time to sit before speaking urgently in a low voice, "Eighth Uncle! There is someone down in the town who might carry a thread of fate, just like what happened with Chu Yi."
This news was entirely beyond Li Xijun's expectations and far more serious than he had anticipated. His brows shot up in shock, and he asked gravely, "Where is this person? Have they made contact? How far have they gone?"
"Chengliao has already controlled the situation," Li Chengliao replied. "Though not as terrifying as Chu Yi, there is still something unsettling about him. He may carry a thread of fate and cannot be taken lightly."
Li Xijun rubbed the jade pendant hanging from his waist, pondering briefly. Just then, the lake beside Qingdu began to churn violently, and a gust of sinister wind swept through the courtyard. A young man dressed in black descended hurriedly, his piercing snake-like eyes scanning the surroundings before bowing his head, "Master, do you have orders for me?"
This was Li Wushao, whose twin hooked tail had already reformed, solidifying his combat prowess. Li Yuanjiao had assigned him to guard and train within the family grounds. Li Xijun spoke softly, "Something has gone wrong within the clan. I must rely on you, Senior Wushao."
Two streaks of black light swirled within the shadow beneath Wushao's feet. He nodded and stepped back behind Li Xijun.
"Let us go!" Li Xijun commanded.
Li Chengliao nodded in response, but Li Xijun hesitated momentarily and extended a hand to block his sister, Li Yuexiang. "You two must not go," he said solemnly, "People like this are often unpredictable and dangerous. I fear they might use underhanded means."
Li Yuexiang paused briefly, then retrieved a talisman from her sleeve and placed it into her brother's hands gently.
"Brother, this was left to me by Father. Take it for your protection. You must be cautious—who knows how strong this person is."
Li Xijun gave a silent nod, then summoned the wind and flew swiftly toward the town. From a distance, he could already see several figures patrolling the air above, maintaining a loose but watchful presence. The Li estate appeared as usual on the surface, yet a subtle tension filled the air, as if it were braced for something.
A Jade Court Guard whispered the gathered intelligence in Li Xijun's ear, guiding him toward the Xu Family estate from afar. "My Lord, the target is at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm… Should we send someone to provoke the devil cultivator from the Xu Family and lure him out for you to observe?" the guard asked quietly.
"There is no need for such trouble," Li Xijun responded, forming a concealment spell. He remained high in the clouds, refraining from probing with his spiritual senses. Instead, his eyes glimmered with a pale light, cold as frost and hazy as mist as he focused his gaze downward.
The Xu Family's protective formation was rudimentary, designed merely to block external interference. With the enhancement of both his perception technique and talisman qi, the barrier quickly faded from his sight. In an instant, Li Xijun spotted a handsome youth standing within the courtyard.
"Third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm?!" he exclaimed in surprise.
