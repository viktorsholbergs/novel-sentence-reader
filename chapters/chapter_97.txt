“Bring him here,” Li Tongya instructed grimly after hearing the clan soldier’s report.
It must be about the Ji Family. After all, the Ji Family is situated between the Lu Family of Mount Tiaoyun to the east and the Li Family of Mount Lijing to the west. Come to think of it, it is likely that the Lu family is thinking of launching a pincer attack against the Ji Family.
Just as Li Tongya was lost in his flurry of thoughts, an old man in a white flowing robe was escorted into the courtyard.
His hair was as white as a crane’s feathers, contrasting with his face—which was rosy-colored. He held a jade scepter in hand, immediately cupping his fist at the people in the courtyard.
“Lu Sisi from the Lu Family of Mount Tiaoyun, which is under the governance of Azure Pond Sect… it’s a pleasure to meet both of you,” he greeted with a genuine smile.
“Li Tongya from the Li Family of Mount Lijing,” Li Tongya replied in the same cordial manner, returning the gesture. With his spiritual sense, he learned that Lu Sisi had attained the fifth or sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
The jade scepter in the old man’s hand glowed subtly which indicated its quality, one that far surpassed the sword that hung at Li Tongya’s waist—a weapon of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.
“Please, have a seat,” Li Tongya said, gesturing for Lu Sisi to sit. As the old man settled into his seat, Li Xuanling and the others quietly left.
Accepting the tea served by a servant, Li Tongya fell silent before asking the question that lingered in his mind.
“What brings you here, senior?”
Lu Sisi raised his gray eyebrows and his smile widened as he replied, “Ah, I’m here to congratulate you… Junior Tongya.”
Li Tongya frowned, unsure and confused by the old man’s words.
“What is there to congratulate me for?”
“Those from Mount Yue invaded our borders and plundered over ten families, destroying six of them in the process. When I ascended Mount Lijing, the mortals seemed mostly fine, save for a few that looked depressed, and understandably so. I’m guessing that your family did not suffer significant loss… now isn’t that something worth congratulating?” Lu Sisi pointed out quietly with a smile.
Despite the softness in the old man’s voice, Li Tongya was visibly tense.
“What are you implying, elder?” he asked cautiously with a frown.
Lu Sisi took a sip of tea before continuing.
“The Ji Family has taken Mount Huaqian, and the Lu Family wishes to reclaim it. The mountain is ours to keep, but we’ll compensate your family with precious items and Spirit Stones. If we work together, we can remove our common enemy and avenge my family.”
“Oh? What is the bad blood between your family and the Ji Family?” Li Tongya asked, appearing unfazed or swayed by the man’s words.
“The Lu Family actually sent a Qi Cultivator to support Mount Huaqian back then, but unfortunately, that person perished there…” Lu Sisi revealed, his expression and voice solemn.
Li Tongya decided to delve deeper.
“What’s the background of the Ji Family? How many Qi Cultivators do they have in their family? Would you happen to know anything about that, senior?”
Lu Sisi nodded with the same solemn expression.
“The Ji Family currently has two Qi Cultivators. The head of their family, Ji Dengqi, is in the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm… around the fifth or sixth heavenly level. One of their disciples just broke through the Qi Cultivation Realm in recent years too… and as for their background, there’s a rumor that one of the girls from the Ji Family is serving someone important in the Golden Tang Gate.”
Li Tongya smiled wryly, before finally shaking his head in resignation.
“If Senior Lu is already aware of this connection… surely, you must realize that we can’t afford to offend the Ji Family?”
Lu Sisi chuckled at the hesitation in Li Tongya’s voice, before setting his tea bowl aside.
“Considering I decided to pay you a visit with such a demand, naturally it would have been because I’ve received good news.”
The old man lowered his voice and continued, “A contact within the Golden Tang Gate informed me that they’ve reassigned many guards from Moongaze Lake over the past three years. If my guess is right, there must be some internal strife happening in the Golden Tang Gate…”
“Oh?”
This piqued Li Tongya’s interest immediately, and his ears perked up in response.
“What did the Azure Pond Sect say about this?” he asked carefully.
“They issued an order,” Lu Sisi replied, producing a handwritten document branded with the word Azure Pond. It declared a significant territorial realignment, moving the boundary between the Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Tang Gate thousands of miles northward, granting the Azure Pond Sect ownership of the entire eastern shore of Moongaze Lake.
“This decree was issued by the prefecture just a few days ago. After seeing it and considering the timing of it all… I believe that the cultivator in the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm from Golden Tang Gate must have reached the end of his life; thus leaving only a cultivator in the early stage of the Purple Mansion Realm!”
Li Tongya’s eyes immediately widened, momentarily taken aback by the news.
“The passing of a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm is a significant incident that the Golden Tang Gate would surely conceal. How is the Azure Pond Sect so well-informed?” he asked, his voice still laced with concern.
The three sects and seven gates were esteemed organizations as they had at least one or several legacies within the Purple Mansion Realm.
It was rumored that each of the three sects had more than three of them, while the seven gates had only one or two. On top of that, the sects were guarded by cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm.
With the passing of the Golden Tang Gate’s cultivator in the middle stage of the Purple Mansion Realm, their influence was bound to wane—though not to the extent of endangering their survival.
Lu Sisi shook his head and replied, “People like us will never know what happened between the cultivators of the Purple Mansion Realm… but that’s enough talking. Will the Li Family participate in this or not?”
Li Tongya shut his eyes and took a moment to consider, a furrow in his brow. Given the Li Family’s current need for legacies and resources, this was definitely an extremely tempting proposal. On top of that, it was an opportunity to address a longstanding issue.
Still, Li Tongya remained cautious and sought further clarification.
“The Ji Family’s connection to the ‘important figure’ in the Golden Tang Gate is rumored to be their young master. Does he have anything to do with that fallen cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm?”
“He’s the grandson of that very cultivator! That lineage… now uncertain of its standing, might be looking to assert its power within the gate. They won’t have time to take care of the Ji Family,” Lu Sisi replied with emotion in his voice.
“Very well.” Li Tongya nodded before gritting his teeth, appearing to be deep in his thoughts.
“I have a few conditions though.”
“Please, go ahead.”
“First, should any of the Ji Family’s cultivation methods or secret technique manuals come into our possession, I intend to make a copy for the Li Family. This is not to be considered part of our agreed compensation,” Li Tongya stipulated, his voice full of resolve.
Lu Sisi nodded without any hesitation.
“Fine by me.”
“Secondly, I will act independently as a rogue cultivator from Moongaze Lake, instead of someone from the Li Family of Mount Lijing. Should I encounter overwhelming opposition, I’ll retreat immediately. Any loot from those I defeat will be mine to claim,” Li Tongya continued.
Lu Sisi was momentarily taken aback by this demand of Li Tongya’s. He laughed wryly and could not help but express a mix of admiration and envy, “Your prudence is commendable. If only my own kin possessed a fraction of your foresight, I wouldn’t have to worry so much…”
Li Tongya smiled softly, remaining quiet. Lu Sisi thought for a while before finally responding.
“Fine. The assets from Mount Huaqian shall be equally shared… thirty percent of the spirit springs and fields will be compensated to your family in the form of Spirit Stones or treasures of equal value.”
Li Tongya sipped his tea thoughtfully, his eyes having a gleam in them.
“Alright then, I would have to have you take a Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath!”
Without any hesitation, Lu Sisi nodded and agreed with a small smile.
“Of course, that is only proper.”
Together, they performed the oath, feeling a faint mark etched into their Profound Scenery Chakras.
Li Tongya then asked, "When shall we depart?"
“I’ll come again in three days and we’ll journey toward Mount Huaqian together, fellow Daoist.”
And to this, Li Tongya nodded in acknowledgment.
After seeing Lu Sisi off, he returned to the courtyard and saw Li Xuanxuan who was lost in thought.
“I still have a Jade Sprout Pill in my storage, a trophy from Xiangping’s previous conquests. I intend to enter seclusion to break through to the third heavenly level of the Qi Cultivation Realm to enhance my chances of success,” he spoke softly, informing the boy of his intentions.
Upon hearing this, Li Xuanxuan immediately rose to his feet and cupped his fist respectfully.
“Rest assured during your seclusion, Second Uncle! I’ll take good care of our home!”
