The sect's true Spirit Medicine Garden is located in a remote and secluded place, deep within the mountain range, with multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators guarding it, making it heavily guarded.
"Such a dense spiritual energy. This is the true spiritual vein of the Yu Zhu Mountain Range."
Before even entering, Chen Xun's heart trembled. In this area, there were caves in all directions, with formations in place and occasional streaks of light flashing by.
"Moo~" The big black ox made a low sound, feeling somewhat agitated. This place was undoubtedly the most dangerous yet also the safest location in the Five Elements Sect.
"Cheep! Cheep!"
Their wild boars and mountain chickens had already started trembling, overcome by a soul-deep fear, causing them to cry out.
"Be quiet," Chen Xun frowned. "I brought you here to broaden your horizons; don't be scared."
Upon hearing this, the mountain boars and chickens immediately stopped making a sound. Apparently, they were more frightened of this person.
"Old ox, take a look; it's the Floating Radiant Profound Feminine Grand Formation."
"Moo?"
As they looked up into the sky, they were stunned by the extraordinary sight. It was like an awe-inspiring and magnificent curtain of light, resembling a beautiful pillar in the sky that suddenly transformed into a pulled-back curtain.
It enveloped a mysterious area, appearing elegant and mysterious, leaving people in awe.
The big black ox was thrilled by what it saw, and in the future, it would undoubtedly set up even more powerful formations!
Suddenly, several probing spiritual senses passed by. Chen Xun's eyes narrowed slightly. He held out the restrictive token and said, "Old Ox, let's go."
Two Foundation Establishment middle-stage cultivators, one on the left and one on the right, sat cross-legged in front of the grand formation. They opened their eyes suddenly, staring at several figures in front of them, all displaying surprise.
"Two senior brothers, I am here to cultivate medicinal herbs. I have already reported my duty in the sect's main hall," Chen Xun said with a polite smile, handing over the restrictive token.
"So, you are a junior from the Pill Refining Hall." The two men exchanged glances and carefully took the restrictive token, exploring its contents with their spiritual senses.
"No problem. Junior Brother Chen, you are in the Revolving Spring Gully of the Trembling Position."
One of them handed the token back to Chen Xun. "Be cautious within the Medicine Garden. A single restrictive token can only open one area."
"Thank you very much, senior brothers."
Chen Xun expressed his gratitude and, secretly relieved, retrieved the restrictive token. If not for the quick thinking and cooperation of these two senior brothers, he would have had to give away a mountain chicken.
"Go ahead, Junior Brother Chen."
The two of them calmly spoke, then took their positions and began to cultivate.
Chen Xun narrowed his eyes. They even knew his name. It appeared that the restrictive token was not as simple as it seemed. They were also reminding him not to act recklessly in the Medicine Garden.
Acting nonchalantly, he entered the Medicine Garden with the big black ox and the livestock. Instantly, they vanished.
"Old Ox, calm down."
"Moo~"
As soon as Chen Xun and the big black ox entered, something unexpected occurred. Countless gazes swept across them, and their spiritual senses immediately warned them. After a stick of incense had burned, these gazes finally disappeared.
Chen Xun looked up at the sky, where colorful radiance swirled around them, creating an area that was like a colorful and splendid glass cover. They were isolated from the world outside, and from the inside, it was impossible to see the surrounding situation.
The surroundings were shrouded in a dark mist, and even his spiritual sense couldn't reach more than half a mile. Nothing was visible in all directions, and everything was serene. However, the spiritual energy here was refreshing.
"What rich spiritual energy! It truly is a spiritual vein," Chen Xun said, looking at the big black ox with joy. It was their first time encountering a spiritual vein. "I wonder how many grades this spiritual vein has."
Spiritual veins in the cultivation world were classified into nine grades based on their quality and size. The first grade was the highest, while the ninth grade was the lowest, each with myriad uses and the ability to even give birth to spirit stone mines.
However, there were legends in the cultivation world of spiritual veins beyond the first grade, but no one had ever seen one. Even first-grade spiritual veins had disappeared, making it difficult to find one beyond the first grade.
"Moo moo moo~" The big black ox celebrated. Regardless of its grade, they had definitely hit the jackpot.
"Wow, Old Ox, I've read in books that when a fifth-grade spiritual vein is discovered, it's enough to cause a great battle in the cultivation world," Chen Xun said nonchalantly, wondering whether it was true or not. "We'll study this spiritual vein in the future. Maybe when we're traveling and having fun, we'll encounter a spiritual vein beyond the first grade, hehe."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, showing that it was necessary; after all, they had accumulated so much merit.
"This spiritual vein not only accelerates cultivation, but its spiritual energy is also exceptionally pure. Its effects are even more pronounced during breakthroughs, making it the object of pursuit for countless cultivators and the source of many major conflicts.
"Old ox, let's go to Revolving Spring Gully and set up camp."
"Moo, moo~~"
Chen Xun sent his spiritual energy into the restrictive token, and the surrounding mist slowly dissipated, revealing a narrow path that extended as far as the eye could see.
They started walking at a leisurely pace, and there was an ongoing exchange of jests and strange laughter. This scared the two wild boars behind them, causing them to become flustered.
The Medicine Garden in Revolving Spring Gully was located within the grand formation, with an area shrouded in white mist, obscuring everything. Even the path they had walked on was covered by the mist.
"Moo!" The big black ox alerted Chen Xun as it sensed the direction changing. If they attempted to return the way they came, they would undoubtedly get lost.
"Don't worry; we're not here for mischief. Just relax."
Chen Xun smiled and patted the big black ox. He was pleased with how far they had come after spending so much time together.
"Moo~" The big black ox grinned, as if to say, "We're the good guys!"
The restrictive token hung in the air, as if concealed by a thin film, revealing the wide scene of Revolving Spring Gully.
"Wow!"
"Moo!"
"Cheep!"
...
They all stood still as if they had been frozen, and even the little piglets had their eyes wide open, captivated by this magical sight.
It was as if... one had always been chasing the dream of early morning, trailing along with the beautiful sunshine across every corner of their heart, even the darkest places bathed in warmth.
The Medicine Garden was scattered with strange spirit herbs, some growing in the babbling mountain stream and others in the spiritual fields. As they stepped onto this thriving grassland, it felt like they had entered a vast green ocean.
Even though they were protected by formations, a refreshing breeze occasionally swept by. Chen Xun lay down on the grass, sighing in contentment. He just wanted to lie here quietly and enjoy the blue sky and white clouds.
The little piglets began to run around happily, disappearing into the grassland from time to time. Sometimes, they stood still, as if they were savoring boundless joy.
The big black ox also began to graze on the grass, while the mountain chickens on both sides chirped restlessly, as if to say, "Brother, let us run around too!"
The Medicine Garden, under the boundless sky, stretched for thousands of miles, lush with greenery, with no sense of vastness but rather full of tranquility. Each small hill was decorated with graceful, natural lines, as if they had been painted without any outlines, only using shades of greenâ€”a seamless merging of colors.
On the hilltops grew a few big white-silver big flowers, radiating faint white light. Everywhere in the Medicine Garden, there was a profusion of lush greenery, as if vibrant life were about to flow into the sky.
This atmosphere was both astonishing and comforting, making one long to stand and gaze in all directions while composing a beautiful poem.
Chen Xun lay on the grass, revealing a faint smile, and his gaze wandered to the mountain stream, flowing through the emerald field and heading into the infinite distance.
The scenery was so captivating and the environment so soothing that Chen Xun and the big black ox had the same thought: who was in a hurry to leave this place? Let them come and experience the power of the Fireball Technique!
"Old Ox, it's our retirement haven... No, it's our cultivation sanctuary."
"Moo!" The big black ox called out from a distance with a mouthful of grass.
"Old Ox, let's get to work. We need to build a chicken coop and a pigsty; this is a big project."
"Moo~"
They immediately began to chop wood. Although these ancient trees reached into the sky, they couldn't withstand Chen Xun's axe. The big black ox began dragging wood to a favorable location.
In the mountain walls here, there were not only caves but also signs of previous cultivation, indicating that someone had been here these last few days. However, this was normal; one Medicine Garden was already a lot to manage, and handling two would be troublesome.
Chen Xun recognized all the precious spirit herbs here, and he even spotted two Foundation Establishment flavoring herbs.
Chen Xun sighed deeply while holding the Fireball Technique axe. There were still fewer spirit herbs here than in the Medicine Valley. They were living a relaxed life, earning high contributions and this pleased him a great deal.
Although they weren't cultivation geniuses, talent was cherished in every world, and they could always find their place.
