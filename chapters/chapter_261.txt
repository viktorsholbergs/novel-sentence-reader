The three men descended in silence. Xiao Chuchou used his rod to crush the jade pieces, sweeping aside the fragments. They saw the shriveled remains of a heart and lungs, along with brain matter splattered on the ground; everything else had transformed into bright jade, appearing crystalline and translucent in the morning light.
Xiao Chuchou sighed as he picked up the storage pouch and poured out its contents with a clatter. Most of the items in it were dharma artifacts, elixirs, and talismans. Although they had won the battle, their spirits were low as they sat among the items, carefully scanning through and selecting them.
After the space of a few breaths, Li Tongya descended from the sky, intending to offer congratulatory words. He glanced at the jade fragments on the ground and wisely remained silent upon seeing the other's expressions.
Nanshan Weng sighed and murmured, "Yu Yufeng... In his youth, he was arrogant and domineering. Who would have thought he'd end up with his immortal foundation disintegrated like this; reduced to shattered jade…?"
Nanshan Weng, being the eldest and most experienced, had naturally witnessed many things. When Yu Yufeng first came to Lixia Prefecture, Nanshan Weng was already a late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and having seen Yu Yufeng in his prime, he could not help but sigh. The elderly tend to be sentimental.
Xiao Chuchou, feeling deeply emotional, nodded and added, "He had established an immortal foundation and possessed formidable combat strength… It's a pity he encountered Yu Yuxie, who ended his path. Who knows how many years he had wasted? The most precious years of cultivation were lost because the sword scars on his palms slowed his progress."
"It's not anyone else's fault though." Nanshan Weng shook his head, as if recalling that fateful day from years ago, and said softly, "Yu Yuxie had warned him repeatedly that this move was extraordinary and should not be taken head-on. He wielded dual swords with dazzling sword auras that were well-synchronized with each other. It was so impressive that I could not even sit still watching him! Yet… Yu Yufeng chose to catch them barehanded. His downfall was indeed due to his youthful arrogance and overconfidence! He couldn't blame others for it."
As the two discussed past events, Chen Taojing and Li Tongya listened quietly. Xiao Chuchou picked up a few dharma artifacts and talismans from the ground, placed them in his storage pouch, and took another portion of the Spirit Stones before gesturing for the others to help themselves to the rest.
After Chen Taojing and Nanshan Weng had taken their share as well, Xiao Chuchou then turned to Li Tongya.
"Pick a few items."
Li Tongya waved his hand hurriedly, declining his offer. "The siege of Yu Yufeng was at my request, and I did not contribute. I was merely watching... How could I take anything from the storage pouch?" he said hastily.
Xiao Chuchou shook his head and replied, "You have done your part by setting up the formation. That takes effort. Go ahead and take a few items."
Hearing this, Li Tongya picked up two Spirit Stones. Xiao Chuchou nodded and with a wave of his sleeve, collected the remaining items. He then cupped his fist and said, "Brother Tongya, do not disappoint the ancestor's intentions… Now that the Yu Family is weakened, this is the perfect time for your clan to rise. We have fulfilled our promise; the rest is up to your family."
"Indeed! Thank you, senior and the ancestor, for your great kindness!" Li Tongya said humbly, expressing his gratitude with a respectful cup of his fist.
Nanshan Weng and Chen Taojing had already tactfully turned away to give the two some privacy, one cleaning up traces left by the fight and the other retrieving the formation flags.
Xiao Chuchou saw Li Tongya nodding slightly in agreement. After hesitating for a few breaths, he finally spoke, "Moongaze Lake's upper lake area is vast and resource-rich, without any major fire or earth veins… nor any renowned alchemy or blacksmith families."
Xiao Chuchou paused again and said softly, "The ancestor's intention is that... there should be no marketplace on Moongaze Lake."
Li Tongya understood his words immediately. This was the Xiao Family's condition and one of the fundamental reasons for supporting their family at Moongaze Lake.
The Xiao Family boasted complete lineages and inheritances. Under Xiao Chuting's suppression, they controlled a significant market share of dharma artifacts and elixirs in Lixia Prefecture and its surroundings.
In the past, when the three disciples from the Xiao Family were still part of the Azure Pond Sect, they converted vast amounts of raw materials and exported large quantities of dharma artifacts and elixirs annually. Most of the profits went to Azure Pond, but the remaining portion still brought substantial wealth to the Xiao Family.
Now, having separated from Azure Pond, the Xiao Family's position has become awkward and rather disadvantageous. The Azure Pond Sect had not only cut off their supply of raw materials but also severely impacted their sales of dharma artifacts and elixirs.
Xiao Chuting had already anticipated this situation. The southern part of Moongaze Lake bordered the northern foothills of Mount Dali, where there were few families. The northern, eastern, and western shores, however, were rich in resources and densely populated with cultivators, meeting the Xiao Family's needs perfectly.
Li Tongya paused slightly. "I understand. The Yu Family's marketplace will be wiped out within a few years…" he responded, cupping his fist respectfully.
Xiao Chuchou nodded approvingly, signaling that the matter was settled. He then added, "Yu Muxian is merely a Qi Cultivator, and with the Azure Pond Sect in turmoil, no one will come to investigate… and even if someone does, it will not affect you. Yu Yufeng's death will likely be glossed over, so there is no need to worry."
"Understood!" Li Tongya responded, and the two ascended on the wind. The two others, who had been dawdling, finally finished their tasks and joined them.
Xiao Chuchou smiled and said, "This matter is settled then, Brother Tongya… you may return without worry!"
Li Tongya bowed in return, and the three from the Xiao Family departed on the wind. He then turned in the direction of Mount Lijing, feeling both relieved and pleased.
"At last, one of my burdens had been lifted off my shoulders..." he murmured quietly to himself.
The forest below sped past him as he flew by. Soon, Li Tongya's cautious nature made him suspicious once more, his mind racing with thoughts and speculations.
"Why did Xiao Chuchou speak to me about the Daoist Master's divine abilities? It seemed like he was intentionally mentioning it to me... Was it a warning? Or was it a gesture of goodwill? Or perhaps… another scheme of theirs?" he muttered with an anxious frown.
Li Tongya raised an eyebrow and turned his hand within his wide sleeve, revealing two glowing Spirit Stones. These were the very stones Xiao Chuchou had insisted he take.
Although he appeared to have put them away, he had actually kept them hidden in his sleeve, using mana to hold them instead of touching them directly. Shaking his head, he flicked his fingers, sending the two Spirit Stones shooting into a large tree below, quickly disappearing from his sight.
Li Tongya chuckled at his own thoughts and paranoia.
"Old age indeed brings overthinking…"
Mount Lijing soon appeared in the distance. Li Tongya gradually slowed his speed and descended into the formation, his spiritual sense scanning the area. A powerful voice reverberated in the mind of every direct descendant of the Li Family.
"Yu Yufeng is dead… Rest for six hours, then set off immediately for Mount Huazhong!"
Before the echoes of these words ended, the stone door of the cave dwelling behind him opened suddenly. A young man carrying a golden longbow strode out confidently. His sharp eyebrows arched proudly, and his face bore a slight, almost mischievous grin. He laughed heartily and bellowed, "Finally, we can get some revenge!"
Li Tongya shook his head with a smile and looked toward the Milin Prefecture in the distance. The rising sun painted the horizon, cutting through the forest. A surge of exhilaration and boldness rose in his heart. His next words were ferocious, his voice dangerously quiet.
"Yu Xiaogui… the tides have turned!"
