Not Running Away
* * *
<<<T-This is a bit bad. I really don’t feel like we can win…>>>
Having gained some distance and finally looking back, Zaratopu muttered in a daze at the water giant’s size.
It’s breathing heavily.
It’s probably nearing its physical limit soon.
“But I want to kill it. Can’t we get close?”
<<<In this case, it’s better to give up, Anego.>>>
Taking a deep breath like a human to calm its breathing, Zaratopu speaks clearly but with a tearful voice.
<<<Not only the seawater that makes up that water giant…… even the surrounding seawater is currently under that barnacle’s control. The moment we enter that range…… we’ll easily be strangled to death.>>>
“What about that path of seawater floating in the air earlier?”
<<<Sorry, it’s impossible…… I hardly have any magical power left……>>>
<<<Tsubobooboboo! This is the final warning! Isopod and lowly land creature! If you house barnacles on your body and become my subordinate, I shall forgive your previous insolence! I shall permit you to serve as a knight at the lowest seat among my subordinates! Now, what will you do!?>>>
An unpleasant 【Telepathy】 voice descends from above, sounding victorious.
Of course, I refuse.
I absolutely don’t want a life controlled by barnacles.
“…………”
I unintentionally stand up wanting to kill it, but my side aches sharply.
Probably because of that barnacle’s surprise attack, my bones are cracked.
I won’t heal unless I sleep for a night.
Zaratopu is out of stamina and out of magical power.
I can’t move my body fully due to the damage.
Feeling frustrated and vexed, I unintentionally grind my teeth while glaring at the water giant.
Am I going to lose to such a nonsensical barnacle?
Can’t I win?
Is there really no way?
<……Let’s run away, Emi.>
……But contrary to my feelings, Extra-sama recommends fleeing.
<The odds are against us. This is the sea. That barnacle’s territory. They have the upper hand, and we are battered. There’s no chance of winning. Let’s run away with all our might…… if we can reach land, maybe->
“…………”
<<<Let’s run away, Anego.>>>
……In response to me freezing silently, Zaratopu says something similar.
<<<I’ll swim with all my might. I’ll somehow try to deliver you to land! If we do that>>>
If we do that.
If we do that, I might be able to escape.
If we do that, I can create plenty of opportunities for revenge later.
But.
“If we run away, Zaratopu…… what will happen to you?”
<<<<…………>>>>
I might somehow manage if I can escape to land.
But what will happen to Zaratopu?
This guy can’t go on land.
It can’t escape, can it?
Don’t screw with me.
“You are…… my underling. Right, Zaratopu?”
<<<……Yes.>>>
I’ve decided, Extra-sama.
<…………>
“Then, it’s an order.”
I won’t run away.
“Fight together. We’re going to kill that barnacle.”
Abandoning my underling and escaping by myself.
That’s not something an Anego should do, right?
<<<B-But but! There’s no way!?>>>
But this underling impudently disobeyed my order!
<<<As I said earlier, I hardly have any magical power left!>>>
“…………”
Such an underling tells me again about the desperate situation.
Words filled with frustration and negativity.
<<<I can’t use 【Aerial Waterway】 anymore! I can’t get close! If I can’t get close, Anego, you can’t fight, right!?>>>
“…………”
Indeed, that’s right.
I can’t fight if I don’t get close.
Moreover, my condition isn’t good either.
But.
But, however.
I don’t want to give up.
Zaratopu, you.
I don’t want to give up on you!
Isn’t there anything?
Isn’t there any way!?
<<<Let’s run away, Anego.>>>
To me desperately thinking of a breakthrough, this underling impudently tells me that again in a gentle voice as if soothing a child.
“I refuse.”
<<<There’s nothing we can do anymore.>>>
“I refuse.”
<<<As long as Anego is safe, I’m more than satisfied with just that.>>>
“I refuse.”
I absolutely won’t nod my head.
I absolutely won’t.
Hearing my voice like that.
Zaratopu begins to get angry with a tearful voice.
<<<It’s impossible! Please give up already!>>>
“I refuse.”
<<<We’ve already reached our limit! Let’s run away!>>>
“I refuse.”
<<<I have no magical power left! I can only shoot 【Water Cannon】 a few more times! There’s nothing we can do anymore!>>>
“……What did you say?”
……Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait, Zaratopu.
<<<Huh? No, I mean…… I don’t have any magical power left……>>>
“Even so, you can shoot 【Water Cannon】? The one you spit water from your mouth?”
<<<Anego…… that’s just false hope. 【Water Cannon】 can’t inflict damage on that barnacle.>>>
In response to my question, Zaratopu sighed in frustration.
<<<As I said earlier, all the seawater that makes up that water giant is under the barnacle’s control. Even if my 【Water Cannon】 hits, it will immediately take control of the water bullet. The impact will be absorbed, resulting in no damage.>>>
If it’s a water-based attack, it won’t work.
But.
What if it’s not water?
“Zaratopu, I thought of something.”
<<<Huh?>>>
It’s a gamble without preparation, but.
“We can do it.”
I have some track record, at least.
I tap the forehead of Zaratopu, who is dumbfounded and dazed, then puff out my chest despite the pain in my side and glare at the top of the water giant’s head in front of me…… Barnacle Garozg, protected by height and a water membrane.
“We’re going to kill that guy.”
