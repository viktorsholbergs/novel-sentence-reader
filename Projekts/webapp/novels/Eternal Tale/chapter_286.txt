Darkness is forever the main theme of the Boundary Battlefield. Three days had passed since the big black ox underwent its tribulation.
Buzz—
Shimmering faintly with black and white light, a massive ship slowly cleaved through the darkness, leisurely drifting across the battlefield. Wherever it passed, the creatures of filth perished in bloody carnage.
A river of corrupted blood trailed far behind the ship, all of which Chen Xun extracted without a single drop wasted.
On the deck of the massive ship.
Chen Xun, the big black ox, and Little Red sat in a circle, engaged in constant discussion.
The big black ox had reached the Transformation stage, though his situation was clearly far better than Chen Xun's. He hadn't been battered and bruised by the tribulation, and his physical body was, as expected, even stronger than Chen Xun's.
However, the latter remained stubborn, brushing it off by joking that the big black ox was hairy anyway and could never truly surpass him. He always insisted he was only slightly behind.
The big black ox shared some of his experiences during the Heart Demon Tribulation. Chen Xun listened calmly, recording the details in a small notebook.
“So that’s how it is, Old ox. The Heart Demon Tribulation is indeed about going through certain experiences,” Chen Xun said, now dressed in new clothes, his eyes gleaming with wisdom. “Think of it as just another trial. No need to dwell on it.”
“Moo moo!” The big black ox nodded earnestly, truly unconcerned. To him, it was nothing more than a long dream.
“Brother ox, I didn’t expect the Heart Demon Tribulation to be so terrifying,” Little Red said, his pupils contracting as he spoke with animated excitement, chatting away with the big black ox.
Chen Xun’s gaze slightly sharpened as he casually glanced at the big black ox. The Heart Demon Tribulation wasn’t quite as he imagined. It was entirely different from his own experience.
The big black ox’s tribulation aligned more closely with the typical understanding of a Heart Demon Tribulation, but Chen Xun’s was of a completely different nature.
“Moo?”
The big black ox suddenly called out to Chen Xun, looking puzzled. “Big Brother, you haven’t told us about your Heart Demon Tribulation yet.”
Little Red was equally curious, his gaze shifting to Chen Xun. After all, Chen Xun had awakened swiftly after his tribulation, while the big black ox had taken several days to recover.
“Me? I just went farming with you guys. Haha,” Chen Xun replied with a gentle smile, glancing toward the Five Elements Spirit Tree. “We were all there. Yours was the tougher tribulation, Old ox, so I woke up faster.”
“Moo~~” The big black ox snorted in realization, exhaling through his nose.
“Brother Xun, even me?” Little Red asked excitedly. He had never experienced farming before. “Does that mean we were all together?”
“Of course.” Chen Xun nodded with conviction and began spinning a tale. “You were the village’s mutated big red dog, and I was the one who saved you!”
The big black ox and Little Red widened their mouths in amazement, utterly convinced.
Half a day later.
Everyone busied themselves with their tasks. The big black ox and Little Red started studying the God-killing Stone, while Chen Xun sat quietly on the deck, exuding no aura.
A faint trace of worry lingered between his brows. He lifted his gaze slightly, his eyes seemingly veiled by a thin mist, making his emotions unreadable.
“Perhaps I’m overthinking, creating unnecessary concerns,” he murmured with a soft chuckle, retrieving a storage ring that housed a tiny figure. “I wonder if the Rootless Vitality Flower can refine this corrupted blood.”
Inside the storage ring were countless blanks for yellow-grade talismans, purchased at a discount during their time in the city.
With a slight motion of his finger, the corrupted blood river behind the ship stirred. Several drops of corrupted blood flew toward him.
Even though these corrupted creatures lacked vital essence, the corrupted blood carried an intense hatred toward living beings. The dark, dense malice also exuded chilling magical energy.
A faint, illusory Vitality Flower descended from above Chen Xun’s head. With a clash of his palms, the corrupted blood merged into the flower.
Chen Xun’s expression changed subtly. The Vitality Flower seemed to wither slightly, its glow dimming.
“This corrupted blood is indeed extraordinary—undying even in death,” he remarked with a hint of amusement, clearly enjoying his research. “Let’s see how I deal with you.”
A yellow talisman floated mid-air as energies of vitality, elemental force, and the five elements converged into a swirling current from all directions.
Two figures appeared beside Chen Xun, sitting cross-legged. Their foreheads were adorned with intricate, mysterious runes, flashing with divine light.
They held two fingers before their chests, suppressing the yellow-grade talismans. Three more figures appeared and began refining the corrupted blood using the Rootless Vitality Flower.
Chen Xun multitasked with ease, his fingers deftly drawing symbols, but the talismans still looked quite ugly, turning black as they were formed.
For a transformation cultivator to refine yellow-grade talismans with their soul out of the body was a ridiculous feat—only Chen Xun could manage it, and only the endless energy of the heavens and earth, the five elements, could sustain such a consumption.
Inside the attic. The big black ox and Little Red were busy running around, handling the God-killing Stone, occasionally emitting lewd chuckles.
They stole a glance at Big Brother, clearly preoccupied, though they were whispering something sneaky. Whatever they were plotting, it certainly wasn’t anything good for the corrupted creatures.
On the black earth below, several corrupted beings had noticed the massive ship emitting a living aura.
Too arrogant!
More and more corrupted creatures, fearless and reckless, charged toward the floating ship. However, before they could make contact, they were obliterated by a storm of God-killing Winds.
The big black ox stood at the side of the ship, coldly glancing at them. The power of his longevity had far surpassed the imagination of these corrupted beings.
He and Little Red were clearing the God-killing Winds from the God-killing Stone, capturing the cold energy of the battlefield.
Their partnership was a perfect match. The big black ox had never forgotten to help Little Red increase his divine sense, regardless of the outcome—it was worth the effort.
On the deck.
Chen Xun was still focused on drawing talismans. After breaking through to Divine Transformation, his work was becoming much smoother, with significantly reduced effort.
"Corrupted blood, truly a remarkable thing," he suddenly sneered, looking at the floating, darkened talismans. They gave off an unsettling aura. "It seems the effects of these corrupted bloods vary depending on the cultivation realm."
"Refining Qi, Foundation Establishment level is useless, Golden Core, Nascent Soul... Divine Transformation!"
Chen Xun slowly stood up, his gaze deep and unwavering as he looked out over the vast, blackened earth. "Corrupted creatures, let me show you what a true hunter looks like."
A fierce wind arose!
Buzz—
Ahead of them stood a black mountain, its chill air dense and suffocating.
At the mountain’s peak, a corrupted Nascent Soul being suddenly opened its eyes. Its expression was grim as it stared at the slowly approaching living ship.
Corrupted beings hidden in the black mountain emerged, all at least at the Foundation Establishment stage.
Their faces twisted with intense hatred as they viciously glared at the giant ship soaring through the air. They were clearly seeking death!
A gray figure stood at the front, atop a crane-headed formation. Slowly, a black axe appeared in his hand, and with a slight wave, he aimed it toward the ship.
All the corrupted beings were shaken to their core as a massive, world-shattering black axe beam sliced through the sky, heading toward the black mountain, impossible to evade!
Boom!!
The entire black mountain was cleaved in half, an overwhelming wave of death energy sweeping across. The lifespan of the corrupted creatures seemed to be sucked away, their vitality pulled into the whirlpool of death, obliterated in an instant.
The corrupted Nascent Soul being didn’t even have time to react, confusion and disbelief in its eyes, before it, along with the shattered mountaintop, experienced the profound truth of life and death.
Boom!
A tremendous sound echoed across the land. The giant ship didn't change its course, charging straight into the black mountain.
The towering black mountain was shattered into pieces in an instant, but it didn’t slow the giant ship’s momentum in the slightest. It could only watch as the ship sailed away.
Wherever the ship passed, the land was left scarred, with piles of corrupted bodies forming mountains. The river of corrupted blood behind the ship continued to grow stronger.
The giant ship rampaged through the battlefield, unchecked and unstoppable!
Wherever they saw a black mountain, they charged straight at it. Countless corrupted Nascent Soul beings were killed, and numerous mountains were destroyed by the collision.
As they slaughtered the corrupted creatures, a hint of unease finally appeared in their eyes and hearts.
