In the tranquil mountains, a thin mist lingered, occasionally lifting fallen leaves with a gentle breeze, while blades of grass swayed lightly.
However, upon closer inspection, it seemed like two figures were strolling along the mountain path, their expressions calm as they descended.
Suddenly!
A rare event that only occurs once in a hundred years unfolded before them. A woman with severe injuries descended from the sky atop a magical artifact, aiming towards the mountains.
She swayed her delicate body, her yellow dress stained red with fresh blood, traces of blood at the corners of her mouth, and her eyes filled with unwillingness.
Coincidentally, or not, she was about to land right where Chen Xun and the big black ox were taking their next step.
However, being severely injured, the woman had already been noticed by Chen Xun and the big black ox, who exchanged a deep look.
In an instant, they were enveloped in a fierce whirlwind that swept across all directions, disappearing in the blink of an eye, the speed and strength of which caused the hem of the woman's yellow dress to rustle in the wind.
Her pupils widened in astonishment, her clothes fluttering in the wind as she stood there, dumbfounded.
Far away, about 'eight hundred miles' ahead, Chen Xun and the big black ox were still running wildly, constantly spreading their spiritual awareness.
"Old ox, this woman is at the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, she's not insignificant." Chen Xun said as he ran, "Those who can achieve Foundation Establishment in Qian Nation all have some background. Let's not get involved."
"Moo!"
The big black ox nodded heavily, galloping forward. If they could severely injure someone at the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, then there must be pursuers behind her.
If they were ordinary civilians, they might consider leaving some medicinal herbs behind, but it's better to stay away from Foundation Establishment cultivators like her...
"Old ox, let's head east!"
"Moo~~!"
Another burst of speed, and the two figures disappeared completely. Nobody around here had seen their faces or recognized them.
One month later.
At the border between Zhiyang Province and Kaiyang Province, towering snow-capped mountains pierced the azure sky, majestic and magnificent.
The snow-capped mountains stretched endlessly, seemingly still resonating with faint tremors.
Viewed from afar, at the main peak of the snow-capped mountains, a silver dragon spanned the horizon, majestic and resplendent.
The Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun was considered a sacred mountain in the hearts of the people in the surrounding areas, with continuous snow peaks dividing the two provinces.
Looking at it from a distance, one could feel how small they were, silently sighing at the greatness of the heavens and the earth.
Thousands of peaks and ridges, as far as the eye could see, were all covered in white, sparkling with a continuous stream of silver light. Two figures gradually appeared on the horizon.
They strolled across the open, snowy wilderness, as if holding their breath deep in the ocean, quietly diving deeper and deeper...
The snow wind continued to howl, crystalline snowflakes drifting down on them, seemingly melting slowly.
"Old ox, it's truly magnificent!"
"Moo~!"
Chen Xun stopped, holding the big black ox's reins. They looked into the distance, their eyes filled with astonishment and awe.
Although the Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun was not as vast as the Southern Dipper Mountain, it was still an extraordinary sight, continuing to awe them.
Along the way, they also gathered a lot of information. The Qian Nation was safe, and there had been no changes in the regime.
The world seemed to have become quiet, with only the sound of falling snowflakes.
Two tiny figures stood in front of the Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun, like giants overlooking the two ants below.
"Old ox, let's approach everything with a sense of awe, for everything we encounter... is a surprise."
Chen Xun's voice trembled, unsure why he was feeling so moved. Their pursuit of immortality was meaningful.
Of course, except for the Crane Spirit Tree," Chen Xun added silently in his mind.
"Moo moo~" The big black ox nodded excitedly, rubbing against Chen Xun.
Surprisingly, the two stood there motionless, their eyes fixed on the snow-capped mountains, completely oblivious to the passage of time.
Half a day later, Chen Xun couldn't resist the urge and took out his drawing board, exclaiming, "Old ox, with such a magnificent sight, how can I not capture it on canvas!?"
"Moo moo??" The big black ox stood up in astonishment, wondering if his big brother should reconsider.
"Haha... Old Ox, in these years, my painting skills have greatly improved. Do you dare underestimate me?!"
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded helplessly, resting his head on Chen Xun's shoulder.
Chen Xun blushed slightly. Honestly, when it came to singing and painting skills, he hadn't been surpassed by anyone. Even if there were painting or singing geniuses in the cultivation world, he wouldn't acknowledge them.
The duo immersed themselves in creative work, with the big black ox anxiously mooing on the sidelines. Was Chen Xun painting a scarecrow?!
"Old Ox, quiet down. How dare you disturb my artistic inspiration."
A bead of sweat appeared on Chen Xun's forehead. Why was it so hot on this snowy day...
"Moo!!" The big black ox yelled anxiously, both hooves already resting on Chen Xun's body.
They immediately took a Qi Gathering Pill. If they didn't finish this masterpiece, wouldn't their trip be in vain?
For three consecutive days, they sat in the snowdrifts painting, finally completing their masterpiece. Their loud laughter even drowned out the sound of the wind and snow.
"Old ox, how is it?!" Chen Xun held up the painting board, even his pores trembling.
"Moo~~!" The big black ox sighed deeply. Excellent! After all, he also had his share of credit in it.
But the big black ox was also a bit puzzled. Why did he look so strange in the painting? Was this how Chen Xun saw him...?
In an instant, a Yellow Grade Inferior Immortal Sword emerged from Chen Xun's storage bag, standing tall on the snowy plain.
"Moo?"
"Old ox, get on the sword, let's go skiing!!"
"Moo!!"
"Hahaha, charge!"
Swish!
Swish!
...
Amidst the white snowflakes, a flying sword carried a man and an ox, breaking through the air and blowing away countless snowflakes from their original trajectory.
Excited, they headed towards the distant peak of the Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun, with ghostly cries and wolf howls echoing in the sky.
Chen Xun had observed it before coming. As described on the map, the environment at the border of the two provinces was harsh, with no spiritual veins or gathered spiritual energy, and no cultivation sects or cultivators.
The climate here was changeable, and the surrounding area was sparsely populated, making it unsuitable for ordinary people to live.
But they still needed to observe for a while. Disturbing the breakthrough was the most taboo. A slight mistake could lead to demonic possession.
It seemed like Chen Xun was just playing around with the big black ox, but he really was playing around.
An hour later.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood on the top of the snowy mountain, the sky was azure and serene, the sunlight dazzling, and the snow even whiter and more dazzling.
They gazed upon the world; countless clouds seemed to be beneath their feet. There were no fierce beasts here, only the swift and violent cold wind whistling incessantly.
Under the sunlight, another snow peak was translucent, glowing all over, ethereal, and dreamlike.
At the foot of another snow peak, there seemed to be dense greenery and towering ancient trees, along with plenty of fertile land yet to be cultivated.
Chen Xun and the big black ox's faces were constantly blown by the cold wind, their mouths twisted, and their ears filled with the sound of the wind, their heads buzzing.
They couldn't help but shiver. Damn, this was really not a place for humans.
A barrier of mana rose, finally bringing peace to the world. Chen Xun and the big black ox both breathed a sigh of relief, sitting quietly on the top of the snowy mountain, enjoying the sea of clouds.
