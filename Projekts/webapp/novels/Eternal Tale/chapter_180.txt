“No matter which side wins, the structure of the cultivation world will undergo tremendous changes, and rules may no longer exist.”
“Yes, we passed through the Qian Nation and noticed some Foundation Establishment cultivators had already started to break the rules.”
“But there are very few Nascent Soul cultivators in the entire cultivation world who haven’t participated in the war. They either have little life span left and are in decline, or they are seriously injured and unable to fight.” Jin Yu looked at them meaningfully. “It’s absolutely impossible for a rogue cultivator to reach the Nascent Soul stage, let alone the Golden Core stage.”
Chen Xun gave Jin Yu a serious look. It seemed she was also pretending to be a master that night...
He understood this statement as well. In the cultivation world, without a mentor or the protection of a sect, dreaming of soaring in the cultivation path was like daydreaming.
However, because of this, during the great battles in the cultivation world, no one could stay out of it, especially those who managed to cultivate to the Nascent Soul stage.
Who knows how many resources the sect had invested in them, and the care from their masters and fellow disciples — such bonds are impossible to ever sever.
“Daoist Jin Yu, so you’re saying that my brother and I are in a very special position right now?” Chen Xun’s lips curled up slightly, glancing at the big black ox. “Daoist Jin Yu, if you have something to say, just say it directly. No need to beat around the bush with us.”
The big black ox was filled with a look of astonishment, feeling as though it had heard many grand matters, broadening its perspective once again. When Chen Xun finished speaking, it seemed that the world went quiet.
The snow peak was covered in white; pure, and clean, as snowflakes fell gently like cotton from the sky.
Jin Yu remained silent for a long time before speaking slowly, “I don’t know how long if a lifespan you have left, Daoist Chen, but from what I see, your vital energy is as powerful as a dragon, so you must be quite young.”
Chen Xun did not respond, just quietly watched her, his expression unreadable.
“If the dark times I foresee do come, I hope you will lend a hand to the disciples of Nine Palaces Mountain.” Jin Yu’s expression dimmed, the situation in the northern border might be even more dire than reported. “Many of them were rescued from various countries and have nowhere else to go. While you are at Nine Palaces Mountain, if you need anything, feel free to command the disciples. If you need any information, the Moon Tower can also help. The influence of Moon Tower spans across many countries, including the Qian Nation, which could save you a lot of unnecessary time. If you think I’m speaking nonsense, you can just inquire the people outside.”
Jin Yu was completely candid, her words very sincere. She had been preparing for this since their first meeting that night.
“Daoist Jin Yu, you are being too pessimistic. Everything is just speculation.” Chen Xun chuckled, neither agreeing nor refusing. “We prefer to act from our hearts and avoid conflicts.”
Jin Yu’s eyes lit up upon hearing this, and she smiled. “I’ve overthought. Regardless, all external resources of Moon Tower are at the disposal of you two.”
“Thank you.” Chen Xun cupped his hands in respect.
“Moo~” The big black ox bowed its head slightly in gratitude, not thinking much else, leaving all decisions to its big brother.
“Senior, here is the technique you requested.”
Soon, Xiang Jing returned from outside, respectfully presenting it to Chen Xun with both hands.
“It would be impolite to refuse.” Chen Xun’s eyes gleamed with a smile. He waved his hand to store it in his storage pouch and looked at Jin Yu. “We indeed have some Nascent Soul-related questions to ask you.”
Throughout their journey, they never had a mentor to guide them and had many cultivation-related doubts pent up inside.
“It would be my pleasure.” Jin Yu’s smile deepened. “I have already prepared a cave for you two, located under a distant waterfall. The spiritual energy there is abundant, which will greatly benefit your cultivation.”
“Haha, this... this is too kind. Old Ox, don’t you think?”
"Moo moo~~~!"
"Since you have no objections, Daoist Jin Yu, we will be relying on you in the future."
"You're too polite, Daoist." Jin Yu responded calmly.
"Moo?!"
The big black ox's eyes widened in surprise, and it slapped Chen Xun's back hard. When has it ever agreed to this?! It was also feeling embarrassed. This was a disaster—its big brother was getting it into trouble!
The big black ox anxiously ran around in circles in the snow, occasionally kicking up snow with its hind hooves and throwing it at Chen Xun.
Chen Xun was quite speechless, his mouth twitching slightly. He looked at Jin Yu with an awkward smile, already thinking about how to deal with the ox later.
Jin Yu's expression became somewhat gentle, showing no offense, and she slowly sipped her tea, seeming to enjoy the spectacle.
"Xuechen."
"Ancestor." From a distance, Jiang Xuechen had been waiting for a long time and flew over, snowflakes gently accompanying her.
"Daoist Chen Xun, Daoist Ximen." Jin Yu stood up and stood beside Jiang Xuechen. "This is the descendant of an old acquaintance of mine, named Jiang Xuechen."
"Greetings, seniors. You can call me Xuechen." Jiang Xuechen greeted them with neither arrogance nor servility, her manner as calm as the snowy landscape around her.
"Moo~" The big black ox grinned, wondering if it should offer a greeting gift, waiting to see its big brother's intentions.
Chen Xun also looked at her with a warm smile, nodding gently.
The big black ox stealthily lowered its hoof touching its storage pouch. Since its big brother made no move, it decided not to be extravagant.
"If there are any minor tasks to be done, you can let Xuechen handle them. She is very reliable and won't cause you any trouble."
"How can that be, Daoist Jin Yu? We really don't need..."
"Daoist Chen Xun, don't overthink it. It's just to let this junior learn some things from you. Even understanding human interactions is crucial." Jin Yu was increasingly pleased with Chen Xun, finding his temperament quite rare. "It's not intended to treat her as a maid."
This statement made Jiang Xuechen smile beautifully, feeling somewhat embarrassed. After all, she was the senior sister of Nine Palaces Mountain and couldn’t really serve as a maid for a Nascent Soul senior. Jin Yu's words seemed almost like a joke, showing no regard for her pride.
"Oh, haha..." Chen Xun gave the big black ox a hard slap, causing it to jump in surprise. "I see." He did not refuse further and looked at Jiang Xuechen. "Then we'll be troubling you in the future, Daoist Xuechen."
"Senior, just call me Xuechen." Jiang Xuechen watched them playfully bicker, unable to figure them out.
"Daoist Chen, I cultivate in the center of the valley. If you have any matters or want to discuss the Dao, you can find me there." Jin Yu leaned on her cane, looking moved. "If you plan to leave, just let me know."
"Alright." Chen Xun cupped his hands respectfully. Although this was a matter of mutual benefit, neither side had ill intentions.
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox happily trotted in the snow.
"Xuechen, quickly take our esteemed guests to their prepared cave dwelling. Unless instructed otherwise, do not disturb them."
"Yes, Ancestor, Xuechen understands." Jiang Xuechen cupped her hands towards Jin Yu and then looked at Chen Xun. "Senior, please follow me."
"Thank you." Chen Xun glanced at the big black ox with malicious intent. His back was covered in ice shards, and he angrily shouted, "Old Ox, let's go!"
"Moo moo!" The big black ox grinned, rubbing against Chen Xun.
"Hmph, you're sensible." Chen Xun hugged the ox's head and followed Jiang Xuechen.
Jin Yu continued to sit in the snow-covered hall, watching their departing figures. She finally let out a deep sigh, seeming to age significantly in that moment.
She only hoped that Moon Tower's considerable sacrifice would indeed bring a chance of survival in the future...
