Mount Yue, entrenched in the land of Wu and Yue States, boasted its own customs and had a scattered population numbering over ten million.
North of Mount Li, a vein of more than a million people found refuge under the protection of the Duanmu Kui. With the demise of Duanmu Kui, Mount Wu's disciples scattered far and wide, some fleeing while others sought refuge in various sects. The territory once controlled by Duanmu Kui was now divided among his four disciples, each imposing their authority, constructing palaces amid a scene of turmoil.
Deep within the northern vein, a monstrous beast dwelled in a deep cave amid the forest. Its mouth bristled with sharp teeth and its body was covered with yellowish scales. Its two brown eyes—each the size of a human head, stared lifelessly into the air.
"Finally, we've slain this beast!" Xiao Chuchou sighed, feeling a sense of relief wash over him as he accepted a pill from Xiao Yuansi. Swiftly swallowing it, he felt an immediate sense of reassurance and renewed strength overwhelm his body.
He let out a soft sigh and chuckled before saying, "My lifespan is dwindling and my qi is weakening. Not only has my cultivation stagnated, I don't even move like I used to! To think how heroic I was when I traversed the north… dominating the lands of Jin and Zhao States! Now, in the blink of an eye, I've become an old man…"
Xiao Yuansi looked at the old man with concern, hesitating slightly before finally speaking.
"Old Ancestor, you… you may want to consider trying the blood sacrifice ritual passed down from the sect… It could prolong your life by a few more years and alleviate your physical discomfort."
Xiao Chuchou sneered in response.
"No thanks. When my father fought with Chi Wei and ultimately became a sacrifice for him, I made a vow in my youth… I will never condone any sacrificial rituals."
"Chi Wei... He's truly the devil's spawn," Xiao Yuansi muttered resentfully as deep-seated hatred seeped from his usual gentle demeanor.
Xiao Chuchou was taken aback by his sudden change in demeanor. He hesitated before continuing, "I know you resent him, but the war between the immortals and the devils has passed. The line between good and evil has become blurred... Chi Wei is indeed a villain, but hardly a devil's spawn."
"What goodness does he possess?" Xiao Yuansi exclaimed indignantly, unaware of the conflicted look in Xiao Chuchou's eyes.
"More than a hundred and fifty years ago, when I was but an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, the Demon King at the southern border invaded. Millions faced imminent doom… and while the three sects and seven gates watched from afar, it was Chi Wei and a few others—who had just attained the Purple Mansion Realm—that intervened. They risked their lives to coerce the ancestors of the Azure Pond Sect and others to take action, ultimately saving the day. Chi Wei sacrificed his lifespan during that battle and severely damaged his cultivation foundation. Had it not been for his sacrifice, he wouldn't still be struggling to break through to the Golden Core Realm even now... Simply put, the Xiao Family and half of Yue State owe him our lives," Xiao Chuchou revealed.
"What…" Xiao Yuansi spluttered, shocked by this sudden revelation.
Xiao Yuansi had only vaguely heard about a demonic rebellion that had happened more than a hundred years ago, but the details eluded him. Hearing Xiao Chuchou's revelation was like a bolt from the blue, leaving his mind reeling with shock and disbelief.
"How can that be..?!" he exclaimed in denial.
As they ventured deeper into the cave, Xiao Chuchou sighed and continued, "Who hasn't dreamed of saving the world and rescuing those in need when they were young? But after decades of stagnation in cultivation, practicing tirelessly day and night with no progress, cultivation itself can become a burden. With all your efforts over the past hundreds of years on the verge of fading away and enemies lurking in the dark, waiting eagerly for your downfall to strike at your descendants and disciples, if you only need to sacrifice a few lives to break through… will you choose to do it?"
Xiao Chuchou's gaze held a mix of emotions, his aged features contorting with pain as he regarded the bewildered Xiao Yuansi.
"To kill is to protect your family and ensure the safety of loved ones… To refrain from killing is to leave yourself vulnerable, risking the slaughter of those dear to us. How many can bear such a burden? Whether it's killing one life or ten thousand, the act remains the same. Once the seed of evil is sown, it's difficult to contain. Chi Wei may have eaten your junior brother, but it's not possible to determine and judge if he's good or evil. While he may have eaten a few talented disciples, he has ultimately saved millions in Yue State."
"Furthermore, with Chi Wei's demise, the Azure Pond Sect will teeter on the brink of collapse. That family your junior brother is born into may be able to call it a day and return home… Yet, the Chi Family..."
While Xiao Chuchou was still talking, Xiao Yuansi could not take it any longer. He finally raised his head, his voice tinged with desperation.
"Old Ancestor, how can the world be so twisted? If good and evil are indistinguishable, and if everyone is a mix of both… where do we find our footing in this world?"
Xiao Chuchou nodded in agreement, his voice barely above a whisper as he remarked, "Immortals under the sun are inherently a blend of good and evil, true purity is a myth. The line between good and evil has blurred ever since the war between the immortals and devils ended. Only enmity remains..."
Xiao Yuansi fell silent for a few breaths before letting out a deep sigh. He found it difficult to calm down. He had joined Qingsui Peak when he was young, where Si Yuanbai had taught him the distinction between good and evil.
Chi Wei had reversed all that he knew, and now Xiao Chuchou's words had shaken him deeply. His emotions churned, causing a divine light to burst forth from his immortal foundation—the Vermillion Sage. It appeared that it had been enhanced.
"Only enmity remains…"
As the two conversed, they finally arrived in an empty cave that was devoid of all light. Cultivators of the Foundation Establishment Realm naturally were not troubled by such darkness.
Xiao Yuansi glanced around him, his eyes falling upon a cluster of large yellow flowers blooming in the depths of the cave. A group of stamens curled up, with a drop of glistening dew gathering at the ends of them, emitting a fragrant aroma.
"It's a valuable medicine—Nine-Stamen Spirit Daylily."
While Xiao Chuchou was still struggling to identify the strange flower, Xiao Yuansi recognized it instantly, having been immersed in the alchemy for many years. Xiao Chuchou nodded in realization and chuckled.
"Even if we don't find any relics here, obtaining this precious herb alone already makes the journey worthwhile."
For cultivators in the Purple Mansion Realm, ordinary spirit items were no longer effective to them. Only the precious medicines that had been nurtured by the essence of heaven and earth could work wonders for them.
Satisfied with their find, Xiao Yuansi flicked his sleeve. Mana surged through his hand but it was without the expected luster of a spell.
"Old Ancestor, please be careful… This flower is sensitive to light."
Xiao Yuansi retrieved a dharma medicine pouch and carefully stowed away the flower. Xiao Chuchou observed the string of medicine pouches draped over Xiao Yuansi's body and chuckled.
"Always prepared, aren't you?"
Xiao Yuansi smiled wryly. Dharma medicine pouches and qi collection bottles like these possessed inner space and could not be stored within storage pouches. Despite this inconvenience, Xiao Yuansi still carried them around with him.
After collecting the Nine-Stamen Spirit Daylily, the two exited the cave and buried the demonic beasts on the ground.
Xiao Chuchou performed a few Spirit Sealing Techniques, then spoke again, "With the current situation of our Xiao Family, the Li Family on Moongaze Lake could provide a breakthrough, securing the west side for our family. Moongaze Lake, backed by Mount Dali, is an advantageous location… Even if Chi Wei dies, the Azure Pond Sect likely won't relinquish control of Moongaze Lake. Given the relationship between our families, using the Li Family as a barrier seems most appropriate."
Xiao Yuansi, his head lowered as he cast spells, nodded in agreement.
"That's good, I've heard that Yongling gets along quite well with Li Tongya… Ruyu and Li Xuanfeng are also friends."
