"Senior, there are three recognized major forces in Yuxu City..."
Li Miao didn't think much or ask many questions. He was quite professional as he began to explain.
Chen Xun and the big black ox also gradually understood as they listened. The two of them and the ox continued to move forward aimlessly.
Xianyue Tower, Muyu Pavilion, and the Four Symbols Alliance.
It is said that these three major forces are all presided over by Yuan Ying ancestors, but they are not in the city. They do not belong to the influence of Qian Nation but are people from other countries.
Li Miao had limited knowledge, only knowing that Xianyue Tower had many excellent cultivator women who were quite well-regarded and had good relationships with many sect geniuses.
Especially during the Flower Banquet of Yuxu City's centennial celebration, only the fairies of the Purple Cloud Sect could rival them.
Muyu Pavilion specializes in various business dealings, including alchemy, refining, formation materials, and talismans. It is said to be wealthy in spirit stones.
They seem to have come from the east of Qian Nation, and many small countries' cultivation resources are under the control of Muyu Pavilion.
The Four Symbols Alliance is somewhat mysterious, with many wandering cultivators from various countries inside. They even sell various cultivation world information, and there have been cases of selling information for exorbitant prices at auction conferences.
"Old Ox, did you hear that? Coming out to take a look won't hurt."
Chen Xun slapped the big black ox on the back, making a loud noise that startled the latter, who was still lost in thought!
"Moo!" The big black ox glanced at Chen Xun displeasedly, unwilling to engage with him.
Li Miao smiled beside them, looking at Chen Xun and his spiritual beast, unable to tell if they were wandering cultivators from other countries or disciples of sects.
He then shifted the conversation and continued to introduce, "There isn't much difference between the North and South cities, but they are places where various small forces and wandering cultivators gather. Occasionally, treasures can be found there."
"I see."
"Then there is the central city area, where there are many auction venues and places where various geniuses gather. The centennial celebration is also held there, with many taverns and inns."
"I see." Chen Xun already had a rough idea in his mind.
The big black ox listened with great interest, occasionally swishing its tail. This huge city was much better than the Nine Star Valley they had initially encountered.
"Senior, do you have a place to stay? Are you planning to reside in the city for a long time or just to buy some cultivation items?"
"If the price in the East City isn't too high, I might consider it."
Chen Xun's expression remained calm as he had been looking around at various shops along the way, already keeping them in mind.
"Senior, as a cultivator, you have the right to purchase a cave mansion in Qin Immortal Mountain."
Li Miao looked enviously in the direction of the East City. With the mountains and rivers nearby and the gathering of spiritual energy formations, it was only a few levels below the West City.
Chen Xun and the big black ox also paused, looking towards the east. Several tall peaks loomed hazily, still quite a distance away.
"Old Ox, this is amazing." Chen Xun began to communicate telepathically, "Shouldn't we consider buying some land here and living a good life, preparing to cross the Sky Rift!"
"Moo!" The big black ox also communicated excitedly, but they didn't show any outward excitement.
"Hehe, damn, then we'll go take a look at the auction conference, watch the geniuses compete and fight. Damn, what a life..."
"Moo!" The big black ox became more and more excited as it listened. It was too stimulating.
But in Li Miao's eyes, they still just looked up at the east with calm expressions, showing no signs of excitement.
"Li Miao, how much spirit stones would a cave mansion in Qin Immortal Mountain cost?" Chen Xun withdrew his gaze. They had never purchased real estate before, always digging caves themselves.
"Moo~" The big black ox also looked towards Li Miao. It had already budgeted in its mind that no matter how expensive it was, it couldn't exceed three hundred low-grade spirit stones.
"Qin Immortal Mountain is classified into four grades: Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow. The higher the grade, the richer the spiritual energy. A Yellow-grade cave mansion would cost about two thousand low-grade spirit stones."
Although Li Miao already knew, speaking out such a large number of spirit stones still made him feel a bit despondent. Perhaps he would never earn that much in his lifetime.
"Two thousand low-grade spirit stones?!" Chen Xun blurted out, his eyes full of disbelief. "Is it permanent property? Can it be inherited? Are there any additional spirit stone fees?!"
"Moo moo!" The big black ox also widened its eyes, staring at Li Miao. Wasn't this robbing spirit stones?!
"... Well, yes, Senior." Li Miao was stunned for a moment, then nodded helplessly. It seemed that this senior wasn't wealthy. "The cave mansion can be used for two hundred years. After that, if you wish to continue residing, you'll need to pay spirit stones. There are no additional fees."
Oh no!
Chen Xun's finger trembled, and the big black ox's hoof shook. They exchanged a deep, meaningful glance, their thoughts inexplicable.
"Old Ox, we're out here and can't exchange things with contribution points anymore. Let's work hard. In the cultivation world, spirit stones can buy everything."
"Moo moo~"
They began to communicate telepathically again, discussing plans to earn spirit stones, leaving Li Miao sidelined, who thought they were still considering...
"Just take us to have a look."
"Yes, Senior."
They quickened their pace, moving faster than ordinary people by an unknown margin. Li Miao specialized in body techniques in this line of work, just to earn more spirit stones in the limited time available.
It was noon now, with bustling streets and continuous conversations everywhere. However, they paid no attention, just hurrying along.
After walking for who knows how long...
Suddenly, a brilliant red light burst from the sky. In an instant, the horizon was dyed deep red, like a vast and magnificent crimson seaâ€”incredibly spectacular.
They finally arrived in the East City. Li Miao was sweating profusely but didn't complain. Every cultivator was striving hard to survive.
In the distance, a misty, towering peak gradually appeared in their sight. It rose straight into the clouds like a pillar, tinged red by the radiant light.
The surrounding arrays flickered faintly, making it impossible to see clearly inside, indicating excellent privacy protection for the residing cultivators.
Not far from the foot of the mountain, there was a lively scene with vendors selling various cultivation items, including spirit beasts locked in artifacts.
Many cultivators surrounded the area. Buying things from vendors here was generally cheaper than buying from those immortal pavilions.
There were also many small shops around. Although they lacked the immortal aura of those immortal pavilions, the atmosphere in the East City was noticeably livelier.
What delighted Chen Xun and the big black ox the most was that they loved the atmosphere here, bustling like a marketplace, incredibly prosperous.
"Senior, that mountain in the distance is Qin Immortal Mountain. If you're interested, there's the 'Heart Refining Pavilion' near the entrance at the foot of the mountain."
Li Miao wiped his sweat quietly, not wanting to waste spiritual energy to evaporate it. He forced a smile, "If you're interested, you can purchase a cave mansion there."
Chen Xun took out four low-grade spirit stones and his communication talisman from his storage bag. "You've worked hard along the way."
"Senior, absolutely not! We agreed on only three stones! You're giving me two more." Li Miao was startled, took a step back, and bowed, "Junior hasn't done much."
"Are you not giving me a face, Daoist?" Chen Xun's eyes narrowed slightly, his expression suddenly becoming fierce.
"Huh?"
Li Miao was stunned, sweat forming on his forehead, "Alright, thank you very much, Senior!" he bowed repeatedly, hesitating to accept.
Chen Xun used a burst of spiritual energy to place the items in his hands and then turned to leave with the big black ox.
Li Miao deeply watched Chen Xun's departing figure, bowed again respectfully, then immediately turned, and ran.
Under the setting sun, Li Miao's eyes were filled with joy.
If he could earn a stable three low-grade spirit stones every day, that would be 90 stones a month, which would be 1080 low-grade spirit stones a year!
The more he thought about it, the more excited he became. His pace quickened, and his figure gradually disappeared into the East City.
Far away at the foot of Qin Immortal Mountain.
Chen Xun smiled slightly, as if remembering something. He looked at the big black ox. "Old Ox, do you still remember the 'Big Brother' from the Nine Star Valley?"
"Moo!" The big black ox nodded heavily; of course, it remembered.
Although they had encountered countless people, such individuals were always memorable.
"At first, I thought that Big Brother was a bit naive, but now it seems that the naive ones are us."
Chen Xun chuckled, feeling a warm flow in his heart. If there was a chance, he really wanted to see Big Brother again, just have a meal and chat.
