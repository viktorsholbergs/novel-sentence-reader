On this path of immortal cultivation, they seized the opportunity to ask all their questions about their confusion in cultivation.
Jin Yu showed no sign of annoyance, even answering basic questions in detail, occasionally showing a strange expression as she looked at their booklet. Not to mention that even Nascent Soul ancestors and no Golden Core cultivator had ever been this attentive while listening to her teachings.
Outside the pavilion, the snowy wind howled and the waves surged.
Inside, two figures, thirsty for knowledge, kept asking the kind old lady questions, writing, and drawing in their booklet.
For half a month, they never left.
"Thank you, Daoist Jin Yu!" Chen Xun bowed deeply, his eyes clear.
"Moo moo moo!" The big black ox also bowed, holding the booklet with its hooves.
"Hehe."
Jin Yu smiled and returned the bow, her silver hair flying. She then stepped out of the pavilion, gradually disappearing into the vast snowstorm.
Chen Xun and the big black ox finally learned that Nascent Soul stage cultivators could reforge two life-bound magic treasures.
Jin Yu's suggestion was to have one offensive and one defensive treasure. In times of danger, as long as the Nascent Soul could be protected, there was a chance of survival.
"Old Ox, let's go to Fengdu Pavilion to choose a cultivation method." Chen Xun's eyes gleamed with joy. It was truly rewarding. "Exploring on our own is completely different from being taught..."
"Moo~~" The big black ox nuzzled Chen Xun, thinking they had taken many wrong turns in the past.
"It's okay. As long as we can learn something, it's never too late." Chen Xun was exhilarated. He took out a jade token from his storage bag and shot a beam of spiritual energy into it. "Let's go."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded heavily.
They transformed into two beams of light and disappeared into the snowstorm.
Nine Palaces Mountain, Fengdu Pavilion.
This pavilion was not on any of the main peaks but halfway up an inconspicuous mountain. The surrounding grand formation was intact, but there were no disciples guarding it.
Chen Xun and the big black ox entered the pavilion, which had nine floors. Looking up, they could feel an ancient and archaic atmosphere.
"Old Ox, choose carefully." Chen Xun was amazed. This was the foundation of a great power. "Don't waste this opportunity."
"Moo!" The big black ox was also stunned. Such a large pavilion for passing on techniques allowed them to enter and exit freely. Who knew how many spirit stones it would cost outside?
"Just make a copy; don't move others' things." Chen Xun looked around; his divine sense spread out. "Even if these things are not precious to Moon Tower, they are priceless to us."
"Moo~~"
"Let's go."
Chen Xun and the big black ox flew up. Each floor had many small cabinets, with prohibitions on them indicating the type of spells or techniques inside.
The big black ox's eyes widened at the many array diagrams. Its heart was pounding.
For a whole month, they stayed in Fengdu Pavilion without leaving and finally selected a satisfactory Nascent Soul technique, "Treasure Color Five Lights Art."
This technique contained the use of the five elements' energy and included a light-escaping method, treading on the five elements and controlling heaven and earth!
The content was quite exaggerated. Chen Xun estimated that one-third was boasting, and two-thirds were the actual technique.
This experience was eye-opening. There were indeed many Nascent Soul techniques for five-element mixed spiritual roots.
There were so many that it was quite strange, and there was no special inheritance. Any five-element mixed spiritual root cultivator could practice them freely.
Chen Xun could hardly imagine how many five-element spiritual root Nascent Soul cultivators existed in ancient times. Wouldn't that mean that the spiritual root cultivators were in heaven?!
Today, the sun is shining brightly, its rays illuminating the mountains.
A man and an ox became the guardians of the pavilion, made two rocking chairs, and enjoyed cultivating their techniques there.
Their cultivation method never required seclusion; they couldn’t shut themselves away completely, like with supportive techniques.
Chen Xun even transplanted a few Crane Spirit Trees in front of the Fengdu Pavilion, swaying in the wind and keeping them company.
"Damn it, those ancient cultivators must have all gone to open the path by the Milky Way." Chen Xun thought of the current situation in the cultivation world, finding it quite strange. "Old Ox, what do you think?"
"Moo~~" The big black ox mooed indifferently. Whatever, it was just happy to follow Chen Xun.
"Heh, Old Ox, good attitude." Chen Xun leaned back in his chair with a smile, looking at the distant peaks bathed in golden light. "Ah, this is the life."
"Moo?" The big black ox held a technique in one hoof and slapped Chen Xun with the other.
"Here, sunflower seeds." Chen Xun grabbed a handful from his storage bag and handed them to the big black ox. "I'll study the techniques more thoroughly later. We have the conditions now."
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox cracked the seeds, thinking if the big brother studied techniques, it would study formations.
Days passed like this, with a man and an ox always sitting by the cliff near a pavilion in Nine Palaces Mountain, laughing and chatting.
Chen Xun even asked Jin Yu for a leisurely position, naming himself the Pavilion Guardian Elder and the big black ox the Pavilion Guardian Ox.
They couldn’t occupy the place forever, preventing other disciples from accessing the techniques. They would help manage the Fengdu Pavilion as needed.
Hearing this, Jin Yu was overjoyed and agreed immediately, even offering them a stipend, which they promptly refused.
Jiang Xuechen only chuckled when she heard. Jin Yu Ancestor had moved her cave again, and every few months, she would come to update Chen Xun on the outside world and analyze the grand situation.
But she didn’t know that Chen Xun and the big black ox were often confused, only understanding the final conclusions.
However, Chen Xun was quite satisfied with this. It prevented them from being as clueless as before, like when they emerged from the Tianduan Plains only to find the cultivation world had changed drastically.
Time passed; flowers bloomed and withered as five years flew by.
Jiang Xuechen appeared with a rich expression, silent, carrying three bottles of elixirs. Upon inspection, Jin Yu’s face changed drastically. Her previously good mood turned sour instantly.
These three bottles of elixirs were none other than Supreme Pure Ancient Elixirs, and they were genuine mid-grade ones! The quality of these elixirs made even her envious, but then she thought of something, and her expression turned ugly, as if choked by something.
It seemed that Daoist Chen Xun’s alchemy skills had exceeded her expectations, reaching a terrifying level.
Jiang Xuechen, knowing the ancestor’s discomfort, quickly bowed, and retreated.
In the grand hall, only Jin Yu remained, staring at the three bottles of elixirs, lost in thought. She had originally wanted him to owe Moon Tower a favor, but now it was Moon Tower that owed him a favor.
_What was this..._
Jin Yu shook her head and sighed in the hall. It was like lifting a stone only to drop it on her own foot. Such a person was far from simple on the surface.
