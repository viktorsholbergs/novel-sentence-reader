After dozens of exchanges, Li Tongya finally sheathed his sword, and the surging river water transformed into dozens of clear water swords that hovered quietly. The remaining waves floated around him, enveloping him completely.
The cold climate formed tiny ice crystals on the water surrounding him, occasionally releasing a string of ice flakes that fell.
Fei Wangbai also stood with his spear lowered. His cloak turned into numerous ribbons before dissipating into spiritual qi. The wind and snow gradually subsided, and Li Tongya's water control technique dissipated.
The river water fell like torrential rain but froze into a hailstorm before reaching the ground, pattering against the mountainside.
"Brother Wangbai, your spear technique is truly impressive," Li Tongya praised as he gradually withdrew his energy and landed next to the jade table.
Fei Wangbai landed with a smile and said softly, "Everyone knows Brother Tongya's swordsmanship is superb, but they do not realize your water control technique is just as good."
After this exchange, both understood each other's methods better, making them more prepared for future cooperation. Sparring is far more effective than mere verbal explanations, revealing weaknesses and strengths alike.
They complimented each other for a while, and Li Tongya shook his head with a laugh before looking up with a smile. "My Qinghong has arrived."
With a flick of his finger, Fei Wangbai opened the pavilion door with a creak. A girl came up the stairs, clad in white and holding a spear. Her smile was radiant like an autumn crescent moon—it was Li Qinghong.
"Greetings, Master!"
She greeted Fei Wangbai cheerfully first before turning toward Li Tongya with a beaming smile.
"Greetings, Grandfather! Congratulations on breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!"
Both elders hummed and nodded in acknowledgment. A boy also peeked out from between the floors before cupping his fist respectfully, then stood quietly to the side.
"This is my grandson, Fei Tongxiao," Fei Wangbai introduced him with a smile and then paused.
"Well..?" he asked expectantly.
Li Qinghong and Fei Tongxiao, seemingly unaware of what was happening, stood watching the elders. To them, the two men appeared to be sitting across from each other in silence.
Clearly, Fei Wangbai had cast a spell, and the two were unknowingly caught in an illusion.
Li Tongya glanced at them and understood what Fei Wangbai implied. He shook his head and replied, "My Qinghong is a Foundation Establishment seed… I cannot bear to let her marry anywhere; and if she does not agree, our family will not marry her off."
Fei Wangbai shook his head with regret. He had watched Li Qinghong grow up for the past three years and thought highly of her, but he could only apologize for his presumptuousness and changed the topic.
After chatting briefly, Li Tongya put down his cup and said with a smile, "We have imposed for years… Qinghong, thank Senior."
Li Qinghong bowed gracefully and thanked him. Li Tongya then took out several jade boxes from his storage pouch and said softly, "Brother Wangbai, a small token of appreciation for taking care of this child."
Fei Wangbai couldn't refuse and gracefully accepted with a wave of his sleeve. After chatting for a bit more, Li Tongya cupped his fist in farewell and flew away with Li Qinghong, leaving Fei Tongxiao standing dejectedly in the pavilion.
"Tongxiao."
Fei Wangbai sipped his tea and said softly, "Find time to cultivate. Do not fall too far behind others, or you will only be left with empty thoughts."
Fei Tongxiao respectfully nodded and left. Fei Wangbai gently put down his cup and whispered with emotion, "What a pity… That girl is too talented."
Li Tongya flew over the lake, and the deep green water shimmered beautifully below him. The hour was late, and the pale moonlight fell gently upon them. Beside him, Li Qinghong was in a wonderful mood, her lips constantly curling up into a smile.
On one hand, she was happy that her elder at home had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, providing reliable support… On the other hand, she was excited to see her family after many years.
Li Qinghong felt a surge of joy, and if Li Tongya hadn't been beside her, she might have started singing.
"Qinghong, That boy from the Fei Family seems to fancy you… What do you think of him?" Li Tongya suddenly asked with a smile.
"Ah." Li Qinghong hadn't expected Li Tongya to ask this, and after a few moments of surprise and reflection, she answered firmly, "I have no interest in love, nor do I want to be anyone's wife or concubine…"
Li Qinghong's almond-shaped eyes shone brightly, and her dark hair tied at the back of her head fluttered in the evening breeze over the lake. The moonlight lit up her rosy lips as she declared, "Though I am not a man, I aspire to condense my six chakras and cultivate my divine abilities… I want to hunt down demons and protect the realm, wielding my red-tasseled spear as heroes falter and immortals bow their heads!"
Li Tongya hadn't expected such words from Li Qinghong. He listened with a shiver, staring at her smiling face. After a few breaths, he spoke, his voice gentle yet firm.
"That'll be difficult."
Li Qinghong's determination only grew as she grabbed Li Tongya's hand and said softly, "I want the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique!"
"No." Li Tongya shook his head and refused her right away, speaking indignantly, "The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique was derived from a Grade Four cultivation method and is a secret technique… Though lightning is powerful, the technique is too aggressive. It will render you infertile and even shorten your lifespan."
"Grandfather, I know about that!" Li Qinghong nodded and said through clenched teeth, "I seek the power of lightning, I desire that Foundation Establishment Realm spear in our family's possession. I do not intend to marry or become someone's concubine, this technique is the one I want most."
Li Tongya sighed and shook his head, advising, "You still have a few more years to reach the Qi Cultivation Realm… You should think it over again."
Li Qinghong responded respectfully to the advice. As she looked up, Mount Lijing came into view from afar, cloaked in a faint golden formation. With her parents and siblings in sight, Li Qinghong felt uplifted.
Meanwhile, Li Tongya furrowed his brow, feeling a mix of emotions within his heart.
"Qinghong is ambitious… I wonder if that is a blessing or a curse."
He landed on the mountain with Li Qinghong, where Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling were already waiting. Li Xuanling, not having seen his daughter for years, was overcome with tears.
Li Xuanxuan stepped forward and spoke softly, "Second Uncle… someone from the Xiao Family is here. Senior Xiao Yuansi has been waiting in the courtyard for a while."
Li Tongya had been smiling but was taken aback by this news. He quickly turned and followed Li Xuanxuan into the house. Stepping over the threshold, he saw Xiao Yuansi sitting to one side, holding a jade slip.
Li Tongya adjusted his gray robe and cloud-patterned sleeves, respectfully bowing as he greeted, "Greetings, Senior. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting!"
Xiao Yuansi put away the jade slip and had a conflicted expression on his face. He sighed as he replied, "Not at all… I suppose I should now address you as a fellow Daoist."
Xiao Yuansi had watched Li Tongya rise step by step to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. When they first met, Li Tongya had only been a lowly cultivator at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm; now, he had achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm.
Xiao Yuansi sighed but saw Li Tongya solemnly bow and cupped his fist as he said, "Senior has shown my family immense kindness, instructing us like a mentor. Such praise is overwhelming for a junior like me."
Xiao Yuansi chuckled, visibly more relaxed.
"This is a joyous occasion… Do not worry too much! I'm sure Chejing is pleased with your progress."
Li Tongya took a seat while Xiao Yuansi smiled and said, "Our ancestors made a marriage arrangement with your family years ago… Do you remember it, Tongya?"
