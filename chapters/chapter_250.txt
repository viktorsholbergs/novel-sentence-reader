Li Tongya thought the man's face was familiar, but could not immediately figure out where he had seen him before. Raising his eyebrows slightly, he set down his jade cup and spoke in a low voice, "I am naturally reclusive and not fond of many words. However, I find your face quite familiar… Where might I have seen you before?"
The cultivator, clothed in animal leather with long eyebrows and tanned skin, carrying a short bow on his back and a string of yellow gourds hanging at his waist, simply cupped his fist respectfully.
"I am Lingu Lie from Jiachuan Prefecture under the governance of the Azure Pond! I once sold you a few Wuzha Worms at the base of Cloud Crowned Peak. I was much younger then, and my appearance has changed considerably since. It's no wonder you do not recognize me now," he said with a smile.
"Ah, it's you!" Li Tongya exclaimed as realization dawned on him. Back then, this man had just been a boy with a timid appearance, easily outmatched by Li Tongya in their negotiations. Now, he appeared middle-aged and seemed to have experienced a lot in life.
"Your Wuzha Worms were indeed excellent, and they once helped me out," Li Tongya said, nodding approvingly in response.
He gestured for the man to sit at the other end of the table. Lingu Lie happily accepted, cupping his fist respectfully and then taking his seat somewhat awkwardly. His face showed admiration as he spoke.
"Senior's cultivation has truly been swift! In just over thirty years, you have already established your immortal foundation. I must admit that I'm envious!"
Li Tongya chuckled and nodded humbly. He had bought various items at the market on Cloud Crowned Peak, where this Lingu Lie was just one of his many encounters, including the Xu Yangping couple who ultimately died in the snake cave at the hands of Zhang Yun.
Remembering Zhang Yun brought to mind that audacious young man, a core disciple of the Golden Feather Sect—one of the three major sects. He must have successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and mastered many of Golden Feather's secret techniques by now.
Back when Li Tongya was still in the Qi Cultivation Realm, he could compete with him using a sword technique left by Li Chejing, but now he doubted he was any match for him.
Bringing his attention back to the present, Li Tongya looked at the reserved middle-aged man and inquired, "Your Wuzha Worms are indeed good, but they breed too slowly. When my family was still at the Embryonic Breathing Realm, they were helpful… But over thirty years, only a few have been born. The original few eat more but breed less, making them somewhat of a white elephant."
Lingu Lie paused, his mouth opening as if searching for words.
"The Wuzha Worm's queen is in my family's possession. You received only the offspring, which may produce one or two offspring every decade or so when influenced by spiritual qi. However, large-scale reproduction is not possible…" he said hesitantly.
"Oh? My apologies!" Li Tongya swiftly apologized for causing Lingu Lie some obvious discomfort. While he had suspected this might be the case, he hadn't expected Wuzha Worms to be the Lingu Family's livelihood.
Li Tongya then spoke seriously, "I wonder if you could sell a few more to my family… They are quite useful."
"That should be no problem at all!" Lingu Lie replied as he cupped his fist and untied a wooden gourd from his waist, adding, "I do not have live larvae right now, but I do have these forty eggs in the gourd. If you wish, you may have them for ten Spirit Stones. Consider it a discount from me."
Now that he was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Tongya noticed that Lingu Lie's demeanor was much humbler, even offering a price lower than before.
Li Tongya nodded and asked, "How should they be hatched?"
"Cover them with damp Spirit Paddies' leaves or straws, and change them every three days. Make sure to keep them away from light and fire, and sprinkle clean water daily. They should hatch within fifteen days," Lingu Lie explained.
He cupped his fist, guaranteeing, "These Wuzha Worms are very resilient and easy to raise. If hatching fails, bring the dead larvae to the Lingu Family, and I will replace them for you."
Lingu Lie was no fool. While he guaranteed the quality of his product, he insisted on seeing the carcass of any dead worms as evidence, thus preventing people from hiding the eggs to make a profit.
Li Tongya nodded and handed over ten Spirit Stones with ease, which seemed to make Lingu Lie very happy. For an ordinary Qi Cultivation Realm rogue cultivator, ten Spirit Stones were their valuable liquid assets, and even a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator would not give them away so readily.
Li Tongya could afford this because he had the support of his family, which allowed him to still have funds even after buying a gift from Fei Luoya with two hundred Spirit Stones.
Taking the gourd, Li Tongya asked, "So, your family is skilled in raising insects and snakes…? Could you enlighten me a bit more on the matter? There'll be many opportunities for cooperation in the future."
"Certainly!" Lingu Lie nodded repeatedly and responded respectfully, "My family is also a prominent clan in Jiachuan Prefecture, and our ancestors were great cultivators from the Mount Yue tribe. Later, when the Azure Pond Sect expanded south, our ancestors joined the sect. They were diligent and left behind many connections, which is why we have been able to remain a major clan in Jiachuan Prefecture for hundreds of years."
Li Tongya nodded, this explanation having resolved a curiosity in his mind, and thought to himself, No wonder I've never heard of the surname Lingu! It turns out they were from Mount Yue… It's no wonder then.
Noticing Lingu Lie's hairy skin and dark eyes, which were typical of the Mount Yue appearance, he showed his pearly whites when he spoke and said solemnly, "Although my family descends from Mount Yue, we are still cultivators of the Purple Mansion and Golden Core Dao. We have merely inherited the ancestral techniques of insects and snakes, and are considered among the top in Yue State."
Lingu Lie looked proud as he continued, "There are also rules in our family. Each lineage must travel the world, collecting various types of poisonous snakes and insects. Thus, my uncle and I have spent decades traveling through Mushroom Forest Plain and Lixia Prefecture… which is how I came to meet you."
"Ah, a prominent clan! No wonder you speak so eloquently and act so measuredly… You have quite a presence," Li Tongya complimented, cupping his fist, to which Lingu Lie laughed heartily.
Li Tongya then asked, "Are there many such enduring great clans in the Azure Pond Sect?"
"Not many," Lingu Lie replied honestly.
Having come from such a family, he naturally knew of many secrets and explained, "The Azure Pond rose from the north, producing several peak Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters, who consolidated the forces of the south into thirty-six peaks. Hence, the north has many small scattered families, while the south has more prominent clans, shamanic temples, and rogue cultivators. These clans are deeply entwined with the Azure Pond Sect, moving together, standing for hundreds of years without falling."
"Oh," Li Tongya mulled over this information in his mind and quickly understood the intentions of the Azure Pond Sect. The south was full of Mount Yue tribes and shamanic curses, preferring tribes over clans. By absorbing these people and ceding some power, the Azure Pond Sect easily controlled the entirety of the south territory.
The Li Family was also employing this strategy in Eastern Mount Yue, although it was just beginning. Shamoli might be compliant, but he still harbored his own ambitions.
In a few decades, when descendants bearing Li Family's blood took power, they would naturally be deeply loyal. By also involving members of the Li Family from the maternal side to help govern Eastern Mount Yue, this area would effectively become a securely controlled territory, deeply integrated with the Li Family's influence.
