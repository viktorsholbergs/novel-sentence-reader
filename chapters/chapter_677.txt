Dili Youjie had fought alongside him throughout the slaughter. Even as he heard Chen Yang's laughter, he knew it couldn't be trusted. How could he trust the smile on Chen Yang's face? He now understood that Chen Yang was nothing but a venomous serpent hiding behind a grin. Fear gripped him, and he bowed repeatedly before following behind.
However, Chen Yang wanted Dili Youjie to be afraid. He showed an expression of satisfaction as he said, "General Dili, thanks for pointing out who's the guilty ones and helping with purging. I have already sent men to spread the news throughout the city so that your name can be praised far and wide!"
Dili Youjie knew that there was no escaping the burden of being seen as the one who sided with the easterners and slaughtered the families and shamans. Gritting his teeth, he replied harshly, "Lord Chen, rest assured! With this stock of spirit items and grain, all the local families and followers will align with the ruling family in just ten days. I can raise five thousand troops!"
Chen Yang nodded and stepped up to the platform. His expression shifted instantly, retracting into one of humility as he lowered his gaze. The sudden change in attitude left Dili Youjie feeling deeply unsettled. The youth then reminded him, saying, "When serving beside the heir, General, it would be best if you kept all stray thoughts at bay."
Dili Youjie nodded repeatedly and took a few steps forward in the grand hall, following Chen Yang as they knelt. From the corner of his eye, he caught sight of several eastern-dressed cultivators standing on the other side of the hall.
Chen Yang bowed and declared, "Your servant has purged the city!"
Li Zhouwei took a slow step forward, glanced at Dili Youjie, and said softly, "Dili Youjie… well done. You may rise."
Dili Youjie hurriedly stood up, but he quickly realized that Chen Yang remained kneeling, motionless. A cold fear gripped him. Lowering his gaze, he saw a pair of brocade boots stop in front of him. The heir took the thick silk records from his hands and said, "Organize the troops within twelve days. We march on Northern Mount Yue."
Dili Youjie nodded silently and slowly backed away. While Li Zhouwei held the jade slip in his hand, a surge of shock erupted within Chen Yang. , A jade slip… spiritual sense! He has broken through the Jade Capital Chakra of the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm!
Although Chen Yang had long expected Zhouwei to surpass him in cultivation, he had not thought the day would come so soon. He maintained a calm facade, but Li Zhouwei had already given him a fleeting glance before turning to a young man at his side, speaking softly, "The matters of comforting the people and stabilizing the rear shall be entrusted to you two elders."
Standing nearby were two individuals, both at the Qi Cultivation Realm. One was a young man in Daoist robes, appearing to be in his early twenties—Li Chenghuai. The other was a woman slightly older than him and she was his elder cousin from the first lineage, Li Minggong.
Li Chenghuai, with rather plain features, bore more resemblance to his mother, Yang Xiao'er. He replied calmly, "Leave it to me."
Because both of them were at the early stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, they easily pacified the region. After a slight bow, they took their leave.
The members of the Cheng and Ming generations were of mediocre talent.. However, over the past twenty to thirty years, most of them had successfully reached the Qi Cultivation Realm and gradually took charge of various peaks. Their strict upbringing ensured that those who rose to prominence were more than capable.
Li Zhouwei waited for the others to leave before finally turning to Chen Yang. He stepped closer and spoke softly, "Restructure the family forces and stabilize the unsettled hearts."
Chen Yang slowly lifted his head and met Zhouwei's gaze. The young heir said lightly, "There are news from the family. Master Kongheng has arrived at Qingdu. Before long, the troops will march on Northern Mount Yue."
A surge of vigor coursed through Chen Yang.. He quickly exited the great hall with his back straight and strode forward with an air of confidence. His hand rested on the hilt of his sword, and with each step, the clinking of his black armor revealed his excitement.
But just as he reached the front of the hall, three figures stood quietly before him. The leading youth carried an extraordinary presence, as though he had braved countless tempests of wind and snow. His straight brows and starry eyes carried an air of nobility and he gave Chen Yang a slight nod.
Behind him, a young man in a Daoist robe had slightly pale lips and calm, gentle features. A faint smile played at his lips as golden radiance shimmered around his body.
The last figure was a narrow-eyed monk with his head lowered and expression unreadable. A cold sweat broke out over Chen Yang. Without hesitation, he dropped to his knees with a heavy thud, pressing his forehead tightly to the ground. He then humbly declared, "I pay my respects to the three elders!"
"Chen Yang…" Li Xijun silently observed. While, his jade-white fingers on the hilt of his sword tightening slightly, he thought, This man… over the years, his cunning and ruthlessness have become even more deeply concealed… The impulsiveness of youth has faded… making him more difficult to control. Fortunately, his maternal bloodline connects him to the second lineage of the Li Family, but It's just a pity he does not bear the surname Li.
"If such a man were a member of the Zhou and Xing generation, the heir would have little to worry about! But Chen… he will have to do."
Li Xijun gently raised his hand to signal him to stand and spoke in a soft voice, "Good! You have made great progress under Elder Donghe’s teachings. After the northern campaign, come see me at Jade Court Peak and I will teach you some swordsmanship!"
Chen Yang’s heart wavered between joy and unease. He longed for that swordsmanship, yet being near Li Xijun felt like sitting on pins and needles. But how could he refuse? With great honor, he bowed deeply and swiftly retreated.
Li Xijun ascended the stone steps and asked Kongheng, "Master Monk, what do you think of that child?"
Kongheng quickly waved his hand dismissively and replied, "I dare not say much, he seems like a clever child."
The three entered the main hall, finding it empty. Li Zhouwei sat upright in a disciplined manner, appearing to have been waiting for them. As they approached, Zhouwei stood up, clasped his hands and greeted them, "I pay my respects to the esteemed elders."
Li Xijun first noted Kongheng’s lack of reaction before addressing Li Zhouwei, "Zhouwei, there is no need to conceal it. Let the Master Monk take a look."
Li Zhouwei’s eyes suddenly gleamed. Within his qihai acupoints, the talisman seeds stirred. It swiftly transformed into a deep golden hue with layers of gold interweaving and linking together.
Kongheng cast a casual glance at Li Zhouwei, but the sight struck him like a scorching brand pressed against his vision. His hands clenched tightly within his sleeves and he instinctively turned his head away.
Li Xijun let Li Zhouwei stand but kept a close watch on Kongheng. He caught the subtle twitch in the monk’s narrow eyes, as though he was struggling to suppress something. Li Xijun then introduced, "This is Master Kongheng."
Li Zhouwei spoke softly, "I pay my respects to the master!"
Kongheng hurriedly returned the greeting and replied, "This humble monk greets the Undefeated King of Brightness. There is no need for such courtesy as I do not deserve it!"
Li Zhouwei raised an eyebrow. But Li Xijun, with his hands behind his back, took a step forward. He did not appear surprised as he softly asked, "Master Monk, please explain clearly."
Kongheng’s already narrow eyes nearly closed as he lowered his voice. "The heir should be of the Bright Yang constitution… and yet, he does not entirely resemble one. This humble monk dares not speak too much, but the Bright Yang Dao lineage… in our Buddhist cultivation, corresponds to the Undefeated King of Brightness.[1]That is why I referred to him as such."
Undefeated King of Brightness? Li Xijun thought with a frown. At the same time, he saw that Kongheng had turned slightly pale.
The monk composed himself for several breaths before he said, "When I look at the heir… he appears almost as if he were the reincarnation of the Undefeated King of Brightness! And yet, his mind remains calm… This is highly unnatural! It must be due to an extremely pure bloodline!"
He lifted his head and continued with a sigh, "Moreover, his aura is obscure and indescribable… If not for my ancient cultivation heritage and the fact that the Undefeated King of Brightness has a Dao lineage in my Liao River Dao lineage, I would never have been able to discern this!"
1. The Kings of Brightness are among the Buddhist deities imported from China to Japan in the early ninth century as part of Esoteric Buddhism. ☜
