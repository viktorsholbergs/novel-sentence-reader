Li Family…
Li Yuanping sat in the central hall with a young man standing beside him. He was tall with broad shoulders and thick eyebrows.
It was Li Xicheng.
Those in the generation of Xi and Yue were all quite talented, except for Li Yuexiang, whose talent was yet to be determined. Li Yuanjiao had fathered this daughter in old age, and she was not even six years old yet.
Li Xicheng was over thirty now and had reached the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
"…The issue at the mine has been resolved…It was a rat demon…We've sent Uncle Qiuyang over…" he informed respectfully.
Li Yuanping listened to his report carefully and said patiently, "Cheng'er, the Ebony Mine has the most output, so we must handle matters with our own hands. You've done the right thing to send Uncle Qiuyang… All the disturbances in the mine must be carefully investigated. Maybe someone is using the demon to fill the holes left from stealing from the mine…"
Li Xicheng lowered his head, then nodded thoughtfully.
"Junior understands."
"Good," Li Yuanping nodded in approval and continued, "Go to Mount Yue. I've found Li Jiman for you. Have a heart-to-heart talk with him. Mount Yue produces a lot…"
Li Xicheng nodded in response and Li Yuanping continued, saying, "Now that I think about it, most of those from the generation of Cheng and Ming should already be of age. There's quite a number of them, are there any outstanding ones?"
Li Xicheng replied, "The children of the major and minor sects are all talented. Two concubine-born sons are brought back to the major sect because their children have spiritual orifices. Now there are eleven people in total, all practicing in the mountains. As for the outstanding ones…"
Li Xicheng paused and continued softly, "Each of them has the talent to become Qi Cultivator, but whether they are exceptional in terms of innate talent and character… that remains to be seen."
Li Yuanping did not seem to be in a rush and merely responded gently, "With the implementation of the new system, the four lineages are much closer. These children have been eating and living together since they went up the mountain. As long as they are loyal to the family and become Qi Cultivators as well as the backbone of the family in the future, they need not be overachievers. "
Li Yuanping glanced at Li Xicheng beside him, who still seemed a little worried, prompting him to explain in further detail, "All the direct descendants of the family and those in the major and minor sects are going up the mountain to cultivate so that they can get to know each other and be sent out to govern the peaks in the future. As for Mount Qingdu, with you brothers in charge, there won't be too many problems."
The uncle and nephew were both deep in discussion when a servant approached and announced respectfully, "Family Head, Xiao Muyun from Mount Yu is here to visit!"
"Xiao Muyun?" Li Yuanping was momentarily surprised but then smiled warmly and instructed, "Hurry up and bring him in!"
A teenager, no more than twelve or thirteen, soon entered. He was dressed in black, exhibiting the calm composure of someone far beyond his age. He kneeled, bowed and respectfully greeted Li Yuanping.
"Muyun greets Uncle!"
This boy was none other than Xiao Muyun, the son of Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian, now the young master of Mount Yu. Li Yuanping quickly approached to help him up, taking a closer look at the boy. He noted Muyun's calm demeanor and bright, intelligent eyes and could not help but praise him, "Good… very good! You have an excellent bearing and appearance."
Xiao Muyun simply cupped his fist humbly. Reaching the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at the age of twelve or thirteen was already an impressive achievement. Li Xicheng stepped forward with a smile and said, "Ah, so you are my younger cousin!"
The Li Family had rescued Li Qingxiao and Xiao Muyun, so their bond was naturally strong. Li Yuanping asked warmly, "How are things at Mount Yu? Your second uncle has already established his foundation… If you need anything, our family will support you!"
Xiao Muyun was visibly moved and replied, "Uncle, my father and grandfather passed away together back then, but it was our family that saved us. We traveled to many places, and with the Spirit Stones and talismans we received, I was able to retain my position as the head of Mount Yu. Now, my mother and I oversee Mount Yu… Only a few old stubborn men still remain. I came this time to return the seventy Spirit Stones we borrowed."
He took out a storage pouch from his chest pocket and handed it over to Li Xicheng.
"If the family ever needs anything, the Mount Yu lineage will definitely come to your aid!" he promised sincerely.
Li Yuanping sighed and shook his head.
"Mount Yu is still in the hands of the Xiao Family. Excessive contact between us might give others a reason to criticize. Your focus should be on cultivation—breaking through to the Foundation Establishment as soon as possible would be the greatest help you could offer," he said.
"Yes!" Xiao Muyun replied earnestly.
Li Yuanping then turned to Li Xicheng and suggested, "Take your cousin for a walk and introduce him to his other cousins."
Li Xicheng cupped his fist in response, and the two departed. Afterward, Li Yuanping opened a storage pouch to find eighty Spirit Stones. Along with the ten extra stones, he also saw a small letter written by Li Qingxiao. Every word on it was sincere and heartfelt.
With these eighty stones, the gap left by the construction of the family's formation is finally filled.
Li Yuanping felt a sense of relief as the burden that had weighed on him for so long was finally lifted. He put away the storage pouch, savoring a rare moment of contentment.
Just as he finished making some arrangements, a clan soldier entered the hall swiftly and spoke in a low voice, "Family Head, the elder is asking if the clan has any spirit items that could calm qi."
The elder in question was none other than Li Xuanxuan. The Li Family had suffered heavy losses, and he was the only one left who could be referred to as an elder.
Li Yuanping hesitated before replying softly, "If it's truly necessary, I can send someone to Qingdu Peak to inquire."
Li Xuanxuan, though only seventy years old, had used life-shortening techniques multiple times and had suffered three or four severe injuries. He had aged significantly but spent year after year stubbornly toiling away at drawing talismans instead of taking it easy.
Li Xuanxuan had no hope of further advancement. His current cultivation was the result of numerous fortuitous encounters. Now, as he delved deeper into talisman crafting, his suspicions grew more and more intense.
Whenever he meditated, countless illusions plagued him. He faced mental obstacles and relied on Tranquility Pills to find some semblance of calmness.
The old man could no longer even draw talismans with precision. He had been taking Tranquility Pills at home, but whenever he did, he felt guilty for wasting the family's Spirit Stones and would furiously throw himself back into talisman crafting.
Li Yuanping closed his eyes and sighed. Li Xuanxuan was now the eldest in the family, and no one could persuade him to take a break.
Li Yuanping sighed internally.
The pills are not a major concern… I only fear that…
The Li Family had consulted with experts who deduced that Li Xuanxuan should have another eighty to ninety years left to live. Despite only being halfway through his expected lifespan, his current madness made it seem like it could shorten his lifespan by another dozen years.
While Li Yuanping was lost in thought, he felt a chill settle over him and began to cough. He took a sip of medicinal tea made from spirit flowers and suddenly realized…
I don't have many years left either.
Feeling dizzy, he sank back into his seat, silently tapping the table with his fingers.
Eleven people… all with the potential for reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm… Sister Hong is about to establish her foundation too. Ming'er should also be able to achieve his foundation in thirty years, and then we'll have fifteen or sixteen direct descendants in the Qi Cultivation Realm...
For some reason, Li Yuanping thought of the Yu Family from the past, and his heart sank slightly.
Prosperity is fragile… I wonder if Xicheng will manage the family well…
