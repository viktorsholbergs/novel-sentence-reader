"Chen Junior Brother, Black Ox... you misunderstood."
"Ah?"
"Moo?"
"This time, it is Qian Nation attacking Wu Nation. The people from the Medicine Garden don't need to participate in the war... I'm just here on orders from the Alchemy Hall to inform you."
"Hahaha... impossible! Absolutely impossible!"
Chen Xun’s eyes became even redder, completely unable to accept it, roaring, "Senior Sister Liu, isn't it Wu Nation attacking? Isn't Qian Nation supposed to be the weakest?! And why can't the people from the Medicine Garden participate in the battle?! Both the old ox and I have Foundation Building strength!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox also angrily shouted on the side. How could they still look down on oxen?
"Chen Junior Brother, Black Ox, don't get agitated for now."
Liu Yuan, seeing Chen Xun’s current appearance, was surprised. It seemed like he had turned into a different person, just like his Senior Brother Shi and the others...
When his Senior Brothers heard that they were going to attack Wu Nation, they were more excited than when they broke through. Their Dao hearts were completely unstable. These men, sigh
They just said: No one can refuse when they flip open the sect register and find my name on the first page...
Liu Yuan began to appease Chen Xun and the big black ox and explained the advantages and disadvantages.
Chen Xun listened, his fists clenching tighter and tighter. Damn it, as it turned out, the strength of the Qian Nation's cultivation world had always been stronger than the Wu Nation's.
But when he inquired, those people were quite vague, spreading rumors everywhere. His identity couldn't get in touch with the real core.
The direction of things was starting to deviate more and more, completely different from what he had imagined...
Under Liu Yuan's surprised gaze, Chen Xun, unintentionally, put away the mountain-opening axe and the bandit headgear, and a gentle smile gradually appeared at the corner of his mouth.
The big black ox also began to carefully put away the blades, emitting a low mooing sound.
"Hehe, Senior Sister Liu, I understand now."
Chen Xun smiled and arched his hand, his words like a gentle breeze, "So, the old ox and I won't go to cause trouble for the sect."
His change of expression was so fast that Liu Yuan was caught off guard.
Liu Yuan also smiled lightly and slowly said, "The sect will have people staying behind. Junior Brother doesn't need to worry. You can focus on managing the Medicine Garden."
"Oh... Senior Sister Liu, are you going?"
"Senior Brother Shi will go, and I have been arranged by my Master to stay and guard the sect."
"Then thank you, Senior Sister Liu, for informing."
"Chen Junior Brother, don't be polite."
Liu Yuan pursed her lips, looking at Chen Xun and the big black ox peacefully. "Then I'll go first. There are too many things happening now."
"Good, of course, Senior Sister Liu, take care." Chen Xun arched his hand with a touch of melancholy in his eyes.
The restriction opened, and the figure gradually disappeared. In the Medicine Garden, only one person and one ox remained.
"Damn it..."
Chen Xun weakly sat on the grass, full of unwillingness, seemingly unable to endure it anymore, and angrily pounded the ground with a heavy punch.
"Moo~!"
Boom...
The ground made a faint tremor, and large pieces of turf flew. The big black ox was frightened, and Chen Xun was really angry.
He sat on the grass, disheartened, and said, "Old Ox, we can't go to the battlefield."
"Moo~" The big black ox let out a low call, its emotions low, rubbing against Chen Xun cautiously.
They still had many significant life events they hadn't experienced yet, and participating in the cultivation world's major war was one of them.
Fighting together, killing enemies, and leaving their backs to their comrades, Chen Xun had told many stories, and they both actually yearned for it.
"Old Ox, let's go; take a look outside."
"Moo~"
These days, they had been preparing for the battlefield inside the cave and hadn't been out of the Medicine Garden.
Outside the Medicine Garden, Chen Xun and the big black ox were both surprised.
The Five Elements Sect was now filled with a deep and oppressive atmosphere. Countless disciples whistled through the mountains, and even their voices were reduced, with tension evident in their expressions.
It seemed like everyone was waiting for that day, anticipating the earth-shattering battle.
The entire Yuzhu Mountain Range echoed with bursts of high-pitched reverberations, as if some colossal creature was about to emerge from the ground.
The wind carried a sense of urgency, and even the grass and trees seemed like soldiers. A faint murderous aura wafted through the air, and Chen Xun and the big black ox were both shocked by this atmosphere.
In a distant place, there were continuous and resounding shouts. The Five Elements Sect had already started its pre-war mobilization.
Even Ji Kun and Shi Jing didn't have time to bid farewell to them. It was evident how rushed the situation was. Most of the Foundation Building cultivators in the sect were preparing to join the battle.
As for Qi Refining disciples, they could only prepare for logistics and didn't even have the qualifications to participate in the fight.
"Old Ox, let's go!"
"Moo?”
"To get something."
"Moo~"
They flew on their swords, and the big black ox still looked puzzled, not knowing what Chen Xun was up to.
…
Five days later, at night.
The moonlight was dim, and the boundless darkness shrouded the land, making everything gradually blurry.
The night was deep, the mountains and wilderness were vast, and the Yuzhu Mountain Range was calm, like the final tranquility before the arrival of a storm.
Countless disciples of the Five Elements Sect looked towards the north with reverence, all bowing in that direction. The entire Yuzhu Mountain Range had been completely sealed off.
In the sky, one after another rainbow light shot from all directions, exuding immense magical power, and the killing intent became stronger, sending shivers down the spine.
The Sect Master You Yuanhua, stood at the forefront in the north. A vast magical power was released, and he calmly said:
"Depart."
"Depart."
The indifferent voice echoed in an instant, reverberating in all directions. Countless disciples frowned, breathing heavily, their eyes fixed in one direction.
"Yes, Sect Master!"
"Yes, Sect Master!"
"Yes, Sect Master!"
Roaring sounds reverberated between several mountain peaks, instantly overwhelming countless night winds. But these people? None of the disciples saw them.
At this moment, a sudden change occurred!
Buzz—
Buzz—
A low buzzing sound came from the bottom of several valleys, as if a giant beast were awakening. It was the war weapon of the Five Elements Sect, the Five Elements Treasure Ship.
Three immensely huge treasure ships slowly ascended from the ground, casting shadows all over the ground. Three flags rose against the fierce wind, representing the Five Elements Sect!
Countless disciples had numb scalps, their hearts were excited, and their faces were flushed. On the treasure ships stood countless figures, their eyes filled with unparalleled killing intent, surrounded by a menacing aura, advancing forward to embark on the expedition for the cultivation world of the Qian Nation!
"Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!"
Strong winds blew around, and above the sky, the black clouds gradually dispersed. The three treasure ships that covered the sky had already ascended, emitting an extremely oppressive atmosphere.
The radiant flag of the Five Elements Sect fluttered on the treasure ships, and the moonlight couldn't conceal its brilliance.
In the sky, the murderous aura was terrifying. All the Golden Core cultivators were mobilized, and a desolate atmosphere rose between heaven and earth. On the treasure ships, cultivators stood densely.
They looked down at the earth, their eyes radiating bursts of cold light and bone-chilling coldness without a trace of warmth.
The war in the cultivation world was no longer a battle of techniques. The fierce intensity would absolutely exceed everyone's imagination.
Ji Kun and Shi Jing also stood on one of the treasure ships, their hearts excited yet uncertain. Suddenly, they both looked towards the summit of the same mountain.
A Foundation Building cultivator was waving a giant war flag, continuously shouting the victory of the Five Elements Sect! The triumph of the Qian Nation!
Beside him, there was also a black ox spirit beast continuously jumping and mooing.
They even wore a conspicuous cape with only one word written on it: Invincible!
