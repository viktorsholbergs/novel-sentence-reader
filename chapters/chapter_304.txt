Li Tongya frowned and nodded, while Minghui's expression was serious. He carefully observed Li Tongya's face and warmly explained, "My master is a Maha. Once, there was a demon under his tutelage, who was merely a demon soldier at the time. My master calculated its fate and discovered that its opportunity to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm lay in the Xu State. He spent much mana and destiny to determine that the opportunity would arise in Mount Bianyan within the Xu State. Thus, he sent the demon there to cultivate and await the right moment."
Minghui waved the staff in his hand, producing a series of clinking sounds that echoed in the air like an eagle's cry. He continued, "Later, I became a Master Monk. Knowing that the time had come, my master sent me to Mount Bianyan to capture the demon as a spirit beast mount. Who would have thought that after walking for over three years, I ended up empty-handed!"
Realization immediately struck Li Tongya. The wolf demon he had hunted on Mount Bianyan years ago had spoken of a destined opportunity—this must have been what it referred to. At the time, however, Li Tongya had dismissed its baseless claims and had captured and killed the creature.
Knowing this in his heart, Li Tongya's expression remained unchanged. He smiled and said, "If your master had calculated its fate, then it was destined to be so. Now that things have gone awry, either your master miscalculated or the demon was restless and lost its life on its own. Even if it was related to us, it was fate. How can you question me, an immortal cultivator?"
Minghui forced a smile, despite suspecting that the Li Family was involved. He felt rather helpless in this situation.
The many battles between Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Mount Bianyan had already made it difficult to maintain the fabricated fate. Minghui had hoped to see if he could extort Li Tongya, but this man was eloquent and skillfully turned his arguments around, leaving Minghui speechless.
Feeling frustrated, he could only smile and say, "Your fate is set, and I will not interfere. Moongaze Lake is a serene place. If one of my sect's great masters reincarnates there, I hope you will take care of them, Benefactor."
Li Tongya had heard of many Buddhist methods. Once one became a Maha or Dharma Master, they could preserve a bit of their true spirit, seeking vessels to reincarnate into generation after generation. Buddhists called this the Dao of Reincarnation. Even in their infancy, they would realize they were a Maha and resume their cultivation across lifetimes, which was indeed quite sinister.
Despite his patience, Li Tongya did not expect Minghui to be so shameless as to target his descendants. Coldly, he replied, "Your Buddhist sect may play with reincarnation in the north, but do not even think about targeting my descendants! If any Mahas dare to seize the body of my kin, I, Li Tongya, will personally strangle the reincarnated child and never allow you to use my family as you please!"
Minghui laughed, waving his hands repeatedly, and responded, "Why so angry, Benefactor? It was just a joke. Our sect rarely reincarnates in the south. Even if we do, we do not take the bodies of immortal clans. It is an unwritten rule. Moreover, your family is a sword immortal clan… We would not dare offend you."
Despite Minghui's respectful words, his tone and actions were condescending. Li Tongya, unwilling to engage further, cupped his fist and said curtly, "Then, I bid you farewell!"
After saying this, he then rode the wind back to the mountains, not wishing to speak with the man any further.
Minghui nodded slightly, watching Li Tongya descend into the mountains. He squinted for a moment, his eyes flashing with colorful light, staring at the people below him. His eyes lingered on Li Qinghong for a moment, mumbling to himself, "Thunder techniques... seem closely related to our Buddhist teachings! This girl is beautiful; she would make a fine servant to tend to the artifacts."
Minghui had his own dharma artifact—a golden palace filled with handsome men and beautiful women, where he cultivated alone. Seeing Li Qinghong's heroic appearance, he was tempted even more, pondering to himself, The south is in chaos now, and that sword immortal is far away in the southern border… If I cast my spell properly and abduct this girl, who could say anything..?
As his desire grew, Minghui began performing a series of hand seals to change his form and attempt to capture the girl. However, a sense of unease made him hesitate. Thinking it over, he decided, I feel uneasy. The Li Family is protected by a sword immortal… I better calculate her fate to avoid any possible mishaps, even if it costs considerable time and mana.
Minghui raised his finger, a colorful light flashing in his hand. He stood with his eyes closed, calculating for a while, and then murmured, "I see… She's Li Tongya's legitimate granddaughter… This could be troublesome. He might fight me to death… Alas! Her cultivation is at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and she is skilled in spear techniques..."
Minghui was deep in his calculations when he suddenly froze, still in mid-air like an immovable statue. His plump face immediately became rigid and expressionless. Though he had cultivated a flawless body, which theoretically meant he could not shed tears or sweat, he began to tremble violently. Tiny beads of sweat appeared on his large face, growing larger and rolling over his smooth skin.
Minghui's eyes widened, the colorful light in his hand growing brighter, floating like a star. Yet, he wore a sorrowful expression, not daring to move. He felt an overwhelming sense of danger suffocating him as his legs grew weak, and he was about to cough up blood.
Merciful Buddha! If my finger moves even a fraction more and I continue this calculation, I will perish! There will be no chance of survival!
A premonition echoed in his mind, making Minghui's limbs tremble. He gritted his teeth, cursing inwardly, This must be connected to some powerful being, at least a Golden Core Realm cultivator! Damn it... How could such a powerful entity be involved in such a desolate place? This is a disaster… Being annihilated is no joke!
Minghui had not yet attained the status of a Maha, but as a Buddhist cultivator, he was proficient in matters of past and future. Under normal circumstances, he could retain his true spirit and reincarnate after death.
However, he deeply understood that if he continued to calculate this fate, he would be utterly destroyed, leaving no trace of his true spirit. Not even Maha would be able to survive, let alone a Master Monk like himself.
Sweating profusely, Minghui struggled to suppress the spell in his hand. However, the spell was already halfway formed, and it would be difficult to stop it now. He could only watch helplessly as the colorful light in his hand grew brighter, causing his eyelids to twitch uncontrollably.
POOF!
Minghui had no choice but to reverse the spell, spitting out a mouthful of blood as he attempted to suppress the spell. He freed one hand to form a seal and conjured a golden, glittering palace. It was exquisitely crafted, with pavilions and towers, filled with handsome men and beautiful women walking barefoot.
"Go!"
Minghui painfully activated the dharma artifact, using his palm as a blade to sever the hand that was holding the colorful spell. His body, strangely devoid of blood and flesh, resembled sticky dough, with a thin trail of dough trailing from the severed hand.
Although detached from his body, the hand remained under his control, which still held the spell. Minghui then directed the golden palace toward it, opening all its doors and windows to absorb the golden light and mist. The severed hand then floated into the palace.
"Phew..."
It was only then did Minghui breathe a sigh of relief. He looked at the colorful light and severed hand suppressed within the dharma artifact. With a forceful pull, a new hand extended from his stump, white and clean like dough.
"What a mess!" Minghui cried out in grief and indignation.
