As Li Xuanxuan's knife pierced into the head of the demon deer, its body quickly shriveled. Its pair of antlers also lost their dazzling luster, turning dry and pale.
Upon finishing the sacrificial prayer and with the ceremony completed, Li Tongya swiftly concealed the corpse of the demon deer from sight, sweeping it into his storage pouch with a simple wave of his sleeve.
Li Xuanfeng straightened himself up, feeling the presence of two talisman qi in his mind. After a moment of contemplation, his spiritual sense settled on the one that was exuding a ferocious aura.
Instantly, a brilliant red light filled Li Xuanfeng's Shenyang Mansion, and he staggered back a few steps as if intoxicated, his complexion flushing red. The Qi Cultivation Realm of the second heavenly layer surged within him uncontrollably, prompting him to step down from the platform.
Descending from the platform, Li Tongya and the others were greeted by the bustling noise of the townsfolk resuming their activities. Li Tongya turned to Li Xuanfeng and asked with a beaming smile, "I saw you acting a little weird just now… have you received a talisman?"
Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling also turned their attention to Li Xuanfeng, eager. Li Xuanfeng nodded.
"Indeed! During the sacrifice, two talisman qi appeared in my mind—Strength to Move Mountains and Chasing Clouds and Moon… I chose the former and have now broken through to the third heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm!"
He then explained the features of the talisman qi he chose. After wiping down his hands, he set aside his black bow and picked up a piece of stone from the ground. He flicked it tactfully with his finger, and it shattered into a million fragments that scattered on the ground.
"Pure physical strength… without employing mana," Li Tongya commented in awe and admiration.
He picked up his black bow once more and examined it for a moment before speaking again, "Now that you've attained the third heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, this dharma artifact of the Embryonic Breathing Realm is somewhat unbecoming. Our family has some savings these years… in a few months, you should visit the prefecture again and consult with a weaponsmith, then have a longbow custom-made to suit your strength."
Li Xuanfeng, visibly pleased, pondered for a moment before a sheepish expression crossed his face,
"How could I? There are many uses for Spirit Stones at home... Brother Xuan and Ling'er have not yet broken through the Qi Cultivation Realm. It'd be better to spend them on some medicinal pills or the like. My needs are not urgent; we can wait until they have achieved their breakthroughs."
Hearing this, Li Xuanling burst into laughter and replied, "Brother Feng, why the formality among brothers? I've just recently advanced to the fourth stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm; my cultivation needs further refinement before requiring any medicinal pills!"
Li Xuanxuan also smiled and said earnestly, "I have already broken through to the Jade Capital stage. What's left is the grind to reach the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm… You really needn't worry about us!"
Li Xuanfeng only responded with a sheepish grin. Seeing the two of them like this, Li Tongya felt a great sense of contentment. He patted Li Xuanfeng on the shoulder and said with a smile, "It's good that you think this way. You've all grown up under my watch, growing up on the mountain like real brothers. There should be no barriers between you; speak freely!"
Li Xuanfeng nodded, visibly moved by these words. Li Tongya continued, "You're both right about the medicinal pills not being urgent. Crafting a dharma artifact takes time, so it's best to place an order now."
With no choice, Li Xuanfeng finally agreed to such generosity. After exchanging a few more words, the four of them went to the courtyard on Lijing Peak to give thanks before the mirror.
Just as they entered the courtyard, a sweep of their spiritual sense revealed three luminous pills on the stone platform. Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow and immediately exchanged a look with Li Tongya, who hurried into the stone chamber.
"Are those the talisman pills mentioned in the Sacrificial Ritual Method?"
After paying their respects to the mirror, they stood up and carefully picked up the pills from the stone platform.
Li Tongya pondered for a moment and then nodded, "According to the Sacrificial Ritual Method bestowed by the mirror, it can not only condense talisman qi but also— if the incense is sufficient— condense it into talisman pills! An immortal cultivator can only consume one per major realm to achieve a breakthrough..."
The three talisman pills were translucent and luminously white, with mysterious patterns etched upon them. They were smooth and beautiful to the touch. Li Xuanfeng carefully placed each one into a jade bottle, beaming with joy.
"Now we have medicinal pills to for ourselves!"
"Indeed!" Li Tongya agreed as he nodded thoughtfully then added, "Since the talisman pills can help in achieving breakthroughs and each major realm can only consume one… it would be a waste to use it now. It's best used when breaking through from the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm."
"Xuanxuan and Xuanling can each use one when they break through the Qi Cultivation Realm. That's going to take a while before it happens, and though we won't have enough for both of our use, there will be plenty of opportunities for more rituals in the future; so there's no worry about not having them when needed."
With joy, Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling stored the pills and Li Tongya went back to Meiche Peak to continue his seclusion.
Li Xuanfeng received a few Spirit Stones from Li Xuanxuan, then cheerfully headed toward Lixia Prefecture.
The night shrouded Lijing Town, and the streets emptied. Only a few dim lights shone through the windows and onto the ground.
As Lu Wanrong walked along the street, her servant girl remarked behind her, "The Li Family's ritual is really lively… We never had such festivals in the Lu family."
"We can't possibly compare ourselves to them," Lu Wanrong replied as shook her head, continuing her walk as she continued, "The Li Family's elder is in his prime, and Li Xuanxuan manages the Li Family in an orderly manner. Have you ever seen any Li Family disciples daring to bully others, abusing men and women? The Lu Family's elder hasn't managed the family affairs for decades, and my senior clan brother loves luxury—a character of extravagance. In the rise and fall, the Lu Family is far inferior…"
Having reached the front of her residence, she saw a man pacing back and forth, sweating profusely. But upon seeing them, his eyes lit up immediately, and he hurried over.
Lu Wanrong recognized him as a junior clan brother from her time in the Lu family. A frown appeared on her face.
"Junior clan brother… what brings you here?"
The man from the Lu Family wore a morose expression, his panic evident as he could only stammer out his words.
"The ancestor… the ancestor has passed away!"
"What?!"
Lu Wanrong looked as though she was struck by thunder, exclaiming in disbelief.
Knowing he referred to Lu Sisi, she quickly shook her head, asking softly, "When did this happen?"
"Last night! I heard everything clearly… The ancestor sighed all night in his chair, saying, 'The Lu Family is doomed!' By morning, he was lifeless."
The man from the Lu Family looked as if he found his pillar, whispering to her with a face full of sorrow, "Brother Yuanlu hurriedly buried the ancestor, and now he's secretly feasting on the mountain. The ancestor once told me to seek you out when he dies… so, I ran here overnight! Sister Rong, what should we do?!"
Seeing his face covered in grime and exhaustion from crossing the Guli Road as a mortal to come all the way to the Li Residence, undoubtedly having faced dangers along the way, Lu Wanrong felt deeply moved.
Immediately feeling anxious, she said quickly, "Wait for me to go inside and write a letter back home. If this matter isn't handled well, it could spell disaster for our family!"
