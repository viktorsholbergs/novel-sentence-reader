"I wonder what kind of price the elder can offer the Yu family."
"No, you are mistaken."
"Elder?"
"I am here to cooperate with you and do not wish to be involved in your family matters." Chen Xun shook his head. "I have no interest in the Yu family; it’s simply a matter of mutual benefit."
Upon hearing this, Yu Chen's expression turned excited as he stood up and cupped his hands. "Elder, I understand now."
"I have the God-killing Stone, the Starshifting Ore, this ferocious beast from the Forbidden Sea, and spirit herbs from the Forbidden Sea; I have them all." Chen Xun glanced at the big black ox and took out a transmission jade slip from his storage ring. "We can trade here once a year."
The method for making this transmission jade slip was discovered while they were examining relics. It was far more useful than transmission talismans, enabling true long-distance communication, but could only convey a few phrases.
However, this item needed to be activated with mid-grade spirit stones, seemingly relying on the connection of the earth's spiritual energy to transmit messages. The big black ox was currently improving it.
"Elder, do you have the Lotus Demon Coral?" Yu Chen was no longer calm; his face flushed slightly. "I am willing to exchange it with secret methods."
"The Lotus Demon Coral grows beneath the Forbidden Sea. If you have one during a breakthrough, it has the effect of stabilizing the mind, allowing one to pass through the Heart Calamity safely." Chen Xun spoke confidently, and as he talked, a Lotus Demon Coral infused with demonic energy appeared in his hand. "However, for it to be effective, it must be a thousand years old."
Yu Chen suddenly stood up, his eyes brimming with eagerness: "Elder, this is the item!"
He had no intention of forcibly taking it; the power needed to delve deep into the Forbidden Sea was beyond the capabilities of all the cultivators in their fleet.
"Then we should have a good discussion."
"Of course."
Yu Chen bowed his head and cupped his hands, feeling that he had stumbled upon an extraordinary opportunity. Such things were hard to come by in the Great Li Realm; they had a price but were virtually non-existent in the market. If he lacked the courage, he would miss out.
The two began to converse leisurely in the lookout pavilion. The big black ox, listening intently, revealed a glimmer of excitement in his eyes; it seemed that his elder brother was not merely discussing business.
"Moo~" The big black ox snorted, realizing that the longer one lived, the wiser one became. His elder brother had indeed transformed into the old monster he often spoke of.
Meanwhile, Little Red stood atop the crane head, holding his head high, unwilling to show any weakness in front of the three elder brothers, all of whom were watching him!
On the Yu family’s ship...
"Uncle Chu, why has it been so long? Fifth Brother still hasn't returned." Yu Yiwei's expression was filled with worry. The four-legged black beast emanated a strong sense of oppression, staring at them without blinking. "If something goes wrong, how will we explain ourselves when we return?"
Uncle Chu still held the transmission jade slip in his hand. "Miss, do not worry. There has been no change on that giant boat. I will not allow anything to happen to the young master."
He was far calmer than anyone else; such a powerful cultivator would never act impulsively, especially since they had already introduced themselves.
Moreover, their actions did not resemble those of evil cultivators, who were consumed by various grievances and bloodlust, becoming muddled and acting rashly, biting at anything they saw.
"Miss, we can only wait patiently." Uncle Chu comforted her. "It was the Fifth Master who insisted on keeping them; in terms of feelings and reason, we cannot offend them now."
"I understand." Yu Yiwei's expression deepened, her hair unbound and flowing freely, radiating beauty.
She knew better than anyone why her Fifth Brother was willing to take such a risk. He had never cared for the position of family head, but others would not think the same way.
If they did not strengthen their external forces, they would eventually become mere skeletons. How could ancient cultivation families nurture their descendants? The cruelty surpassed everyone's imagination; bullying others was out of the question.
At that moment, a gasp rose from the giant boat.
"Corrupted Beast? Or is it the Corrupted Longevity?" Chen Xun's eyes widened. "The God-Killing Artifact is actually meant to deal with this?!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox also stood up, feeling as if he had stumbled upon a great secret.
"Yes." Yu Chen glanced at the big black ox. "Elder, the method for making the God-Killing Artifact is top secret; I am still unable to access it."
He felt somewhat speechless inside; the elder's questions were quite peculiar as if he were interested in everything. But how could cultivators live for only a few decades and know everything?
This elder gave him a rather abrupt feeling, like an old monster that had awakened after sleeping in the Forbidden Sea for many years.
Yu Chen did not know why he had such strange thoughts, but the elder’s knowledge and strength did not seem to match.
He respectfully said, "Elder, it is the Corrupted Longevity, referring to immortality."
"It seems the method for making the God-Killing Artifact involves significant matters. I will not make things difficult for you." Chen Xun furrowed his brows deeply, looking at Yu Chen. "So, according to you, when the Heavenly Path opens, will the cultivators go to slay the Corrupted Longevity?"
"I don't know much about this. In the Yu family, the elders are also very secretive about this matter. I can only understand a little."
Yu Chen let out a soft sigh. A thousand years is a long time, and many things have long been forgotten with the passage of time. "But according to Great Li Realm's reports, there are great opportunities after the Heavenly Path opens, which can greatly help cultivators improve their cultivation levels."
"Yes, I know this, but no one has disclosed the specific circumstances. Most cultivators say that it's a Celestial Secret Realm."
"As for the Corrupted Longevity, only the clan elders in the Yu family can discuss it." Yu Chen lowered his head and spoke solemnly, "Elder, there are still three hundred years until the next Heavenly Path opens, but very few return. Those who do have already written their wills."
"The main reason why Great Li Realm cultivators flock there is that there are methods to enhance spiritual awareness, which can quickly break through barriers. The God-killing Artifact is also quite useful there."
Yu Chen patiently analyzed the situation, not at all worried about the state of the ship. With the giant ship blocking the way, who would dare to act recklessly? "If I could obtain the method to forge the God-Killing Artifact, I would definitely present it to the elder with both hands."
He felt quite conflicted; in truth, the reality was even more terrifying than what he described. The Heavenly Path was not a path to transcendence but rather a certain path to death.
"How thoughtful of you." Chen Xun didn't think much of it; he was already satisfied with the knowledge he had gained and could investigate the rest gradually. "Take this Divine Sea Carp with you."
"Elder, I am not yet prepared with items for exchange..." Yu Chen was taken aback. The situation was sudden, and he couldn't possibly carry the array diagrams with him. He would have to wait until the next transaction.
"No worries, bring it to me next year." Chen Xun waved his hand nonchalantly. "This Divine Sea Carp will be useless by next year; its flesh will decay, and its Nascent Soul will weaken."
He glanced at the body of the Divine Sea Carp. The big black ox’s array had no effect on the purple mist at all. If they crashed into it, they would have to fight. Unexpectedly, the Divine Sea Carp had come to join the battle.
Had it not been for the latter showing hostility upon meeting them and losing its senses, forcing them to take action, they might have ended up chatting with it for a while before letting it go.
Chen Xun suddenly chuckled, recalling that large turtle. If he caught it again next time, he would check whether it had reached the Foundation Establishment stage.
"Thank you, Elder!" Yu Chen waved his robe and stood up again. "Next year, I will definitely not disappoint you."
"Mm, I trust people from the three ancient cultivation families of Great Li Realm." Chen Xun took a sip of hot tea, his tone casual. "However, I still have to remind you that if anything goes wrong, you and your Yu family will be entangled in some karmic retribution with us."
Rustling sounds came from the Crane Spirit Five Elements Tree, and the faint light emitted by its leaves became sharp and intense.
Cold sweat dripped down Yu Chen's back. There was no intention of mockery in that statement; it was by no means an empty threat. Even now, he still couldn't see the slightest trace of backing from these three.
"Rest assured, Elder!" Yu Chen lowered his head even further.
"The Lotus Demon Coral will be saved for the next transaction."
"Understood, Elder."
"Take the transmission jade slip and the Divine Sea Carp with you." With a flick of his fingers, Chen Xun made the transmission jade slip appear directly in Yu Chen's hand. "On this day next year, you will come to the Forbidden Sea, and I will find you."
"Yes, Elder." Yu Chen took a deep look at the transmission jade slip, which was somewhat different from theirs and seemed to have positioning effects.
"Mm, go now." Chen Xun laughed lightly, his gaze shifting to the big black ox, wanting to pat its black hide.
The latter's pupils contracted as it retreated a few steps. Why did Chen Xun's gaze seem so ominous?!
Yu Chen cupped his hands toward Chen Xun and the big black ox, then directly stored the Divine Sea Carp in his storage ring.
There were arrays and prohibitions operating in all other areas, and he had no intention of probing. Under normal circumstances, it was absolutely a path to death.
He let out a light breath, stepping into the air. He had sustained serious injuries while dealing with the purple mist remnants earlier and had barely held on until now. He needed to return and recuperate.
"Are the humans leaving?!" Little Red roared majestically. "We haven't done anything to you!"
"Huh?" Yu Chen's eyes showed confusion. What did this mean? Nevertheless, he politely smiled and responded, "Elder, I will bother you again next year."
"Mm..." Little Red shook his head, looking at his two elder brothers, who seemed to have already started fighting. "Let's hurry and leave."
"Understood."
Yu Chen cupped his hands, turning to his Yu family's fleet as he stepped into the air. His mood lightened significantly as if he had just walked through the gates of hell.
"Young Master!"
"Fifth Brother!"
The crew on the ship called out, exceptionally joyful that nothing unexpected had occurred. This was fantastic!
Vroom—
Vroom—
Just as Yu Chen stepped onto his own ship, a thunderous acceleration sound echoed from the distance. The giant ship gradually became indistinct, completely disappearing into the fog of the Forbidden Sea, leaving no trace behind…
