Chapter 4: Just Bring It Here
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
“My axe!” Meng Jingzhou shouted in the illusion, eager to dive in and retrieve his axe.
The River Spirit, holding three axes, appeared above the water.
“Young child, you…”
Splash!
Before the River Spirit could finish, Meng Jingzhou plunged headfirst into the river, bubbles larger than himself rising to the surface.
What’s happening? The River Spirit was baffled, encountering such a situation for the first time.
The bubbling gradually subsided until the river surface was eerily calm, only the ripples caused by the River Spirit’s aura remained.
“Is there no movement? He didn’t drown, did he?” mumbled the River Spirit, not overly concerned about Meng Jingzhou actually drowning, as this was an illusion where drowning was impossible.
Before the River Spirit could figure out Meng Jingzhou’s intentions, another change occurred!
The ripples on the river’s surface became more frequent. The River Spirit frowned slightly, his power well-controlled, unlikely to be causing this disturbance.
He realized, “It’s that kid who jumped into the river!”
Golden auras intermingled in the stream, the mist on the water’s surface hinting at an immense and terrifying power brewing beneath.
An unknown, immense terror caused palpitations! Three fountains erupted on the river, growing higher and higher, their pale golden mist enveloping the entire surface, obscuring the River Spirit’s view of what was happening.
A breeze dispersed the golden mist.
Three figures appeared, all resembling Meng Jingzhou, but their auras were worlds apart compared to before.
The River Spirit trembled, a primal reaction from deep within his soul!
Ordinary Meng Jingzhou, a powerful cultivator Meng Jingzhou, and… a celestial Meng Jingzhou!
This was the fundamental rule of the illusion: anything that falls into the river undergoes mundane, spiritual, and celestial transformations.
“Just bring it here,” the three Meng Jingzhous said in unison, each claiming their respective axe.
With the celestial Meng Jingzhou present, the River Spirit had no power to resist, letting him take control.
The celestial Meng Jingzhou claimed the Sky Opening Axe, the powerful cultivator Meng Jingzhou took the Mountain Splitting Axe, and the ordinary Meng Jingzhou, seizing the moment, took the worn-out axe.
With all three axes in hand, the illusion shattered, and Meng Jingzhou passed the test.
Those who passed the second test fell into a temporary unconsciousness, a natural protective mechanism of the body.
…
The Dao Seeking Sect members observed Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou, who had passed the second test, in silence.
What happened to the honest men they were supposed to be?
Yun Zhi remained silent, feeling a premonition that admitting these two into the Dao Seeking Sect would mean endless troubles for the sect.
She hoped her intuition was wrong.
The real River Spirit appeared, holding two gold and silver axes, furiously charging towards Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou.
As a guardian spirit of the Dao Seeking Sect, he had never faced such humiliation.
“Nobody stop me! I must teach these two brats a lesson today. I’ll break their arms and legs, then reattach them!”
Dao Seeking Sect disciples hurried to restrain the enraged River Spirit.
“River Spirit, please don’t chop!”
“River Spirit, calm your anger.”
“If something happens to the candidates, our sect’s reputation will be tarnished!”
Eventually, Dai Bufan stepped in to calm the raging River Spirit.
“Rest assured, River Spirit. The third test is my personal design. It will certainly teach them a lesson.”
Convinced by Dai Bufan’s solemn promise, the River Spirit finally relented.
The third test, being the final challenge, had two proposals: a milder one from Yun Zhi and a harsher one from Dai Bufan, both designed to test the Dao heart. After voting, the group decided on Yun Zhi’s plan.
Yun Zhi’s plan was too gentle, offering no punishment even for failure. To appease the River Spirit’s anger, they had to opt for Dai Bufan’s plan.
Yun Zhi had no objections.
Letting these two youngsters suffer a bit seemed fair.
The second test weeded out many, as the temptation of the three axes led many to follow their desires, lying to the River Spirit about dropping the Sky Opening Axe and Mountain Splitting Axe.
Those who failed and left the illusion complained about the Dao Seeking Sect’s second test being too difficult.
However, not everyone complained; those who passed the second test didn’t grumble.
…
“The second test was quite simple,” Barbarian Bone remarked, “Just tell the truth.”
Those waiting for the third test nodded in agreement, echoing Barbarian Bone’s sentiment.
“What? It wasn’t about jumping into the river and snatching the axes from the River Spirit?” Meng Jingzhou exclaimed, puzzled why others’ methods differed from his.
Lu Yang gave Meng Jingzhou a disdainful look, thinking him foolish
, “If the River Spirit were real and not an illusion, wouldn’t you have provoked him?”
“You should’ve done like me, asked for the River Spirit’s axes, thrown them into the river, and then all three would count as ours.”
Meng Jingzhou had an epiphany, “You’re smarter.”
The others silently observed Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou, summarizing their experiences, beginning to doubt if their method of passing was incorrect.
Barbarian Bone nodded slightly, remembering his father’s words that the ancient barbarian lineage nearly perished due to their arrogance and ignorance. As a descendant, he must overcome this flaw and humbly learn from others.
Barbarian Bone felt he had found his role models.
As everyone discussed the correct way to pass, Yun Zhi and Dai Bufan, along with other Dao Seeking Sect disciples, appeared.
Dai Bufan’s lips curled into a mischievous smile. With a flip of his palm, a small mountain appeared, growing rapidly in the wind. In just a few breaths, it reached a hundred feet tall.
The crowd gasped in awe at this rarely seen feat among cultivators.
The mountain, lush with trees, was indistinguishable from a real one, complete with a long staircase leading to the summit.
“This is the Heart-Seeking Mountain, a wonder crafted by an elder at my request. On this mountain, immortals and mortals are equal. Your task is to climb the Heart-Seeking Mountain. The higher you climb, the firmer your will is shown to be.”
“Climb to the fiftieth step to pass.”
Someone questioned, “But doesn’t that give Barbarian Bone an advantage?”
At fifteen, Barbarian Bone’s physique was like that of a twenty-five or twenty-six-year-old, towering over others. Climbing the mountain would indeed be easier for him.
Dai Bufan assured with a smile, “Don’t worry about that. Heart-Seeking Mountain will level everyone’s physical abilities. Whether a mortal or a cultivator, everyone will become ordinary here.”
“Is there a time limit?” another questioned.
“No.”
The crowd rejoiced, no time limit meant endless attempts. How could they not pass the third test? Was it just a formality?
“Can we use magic treasures?” They had special treasures from their families, usable without spiritual energy, a significant advantage.
Dai Bufan grinned somewhat maliciously, “Yes.”
If their magic treasures still work, that is.
