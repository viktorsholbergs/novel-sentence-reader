Chen Mufeng returned from the Central Hall to his residence, only to find that his wife, Madam Li, was sitting in the courtyard. Seated at the head of the hall were two elderly men.
One of them wore a brown robe, with the empty sleeve of his severed arm appearing stark against the air. His hair was withered, his eyes sunken, and his entire being exuded the aura of someone nearing the end of their life.
The other elder had a much steadier presence. A longsword rested on his back, and he wore a light gray robe. His posture was slightly hunched, as he leaned against a wooden chair.
Chen Mufeng recognized these two faces all too well. Years ago, when he had been entrusted to Li Qiuyang by Old Master Chen, he had sat respectfully before these very same elders. Without hesitation, he immediately bowed deeply and said solemnly, "Mufeng greets master and elder."
Li Qiuyang’s aged face remained heavy with contemplation. Once a farmer, he was now one of the highest-ranking elders in the clan, yet his expression remained unchanged from the past.
He had once held the reins of the horses for Li Xiangping and offered swords to Li Tongya, witnessing a century of trials and tribulations. Even though Chen Mufeng now far surpassed him in cultivation, he did not show the slightest impatience. He kept his head lowered in silence.
Chen Donghe also gazed at the man before him without speaking. The two elders sat in silence, yet their presence alone created a heavy atmosphere that made even Madam Li hold her tongue.
Chen Mufeng’s heart was uneasy, but then his elder, Chen Donghe, waved his hand lightly and said in a soft voice, "This is good news. That boy Chen Yang’s innate ability has caught the attention of Qingdu. You and your wife ought to be congratulated."
As soon as these words were spoken, both of them let out a sigh of relief. Chen Mufeng cupped his hands and said with a smile, "Many thanks to the esteemed elders for your support!"
Li Qiuyang nodded slowly, setting aside his wooden staff. His empty sleeve drifted silently in the air as he spoke in a stern, low voice, "Feng'er! Bring the boy up here for me to see."
Chen Mufeng hurriedly sent someone to fetch him. The man before him, Li Qiuyang, was not only his master but had also once been his father-in-law. Unfortunately, his daughter had passed away early, which led to his marriage with his current wife, Madam Li.
Chen Donghe waited in silence and spoke no words. When Chen Yang quietly stepped up from the front of the hall, he examined him closely and furrowed his brows.
Li Qiuyang, appearing as if his aged eyes were dim, squinted and stared at him for a long time, thinking to himself, He has a bit of a fierce and cunning look, but those eyes… They remind me of Chen Erniu from back then… both of them were the type to keep twelve layers of thoughts hidden in their stomachs.
His eyes were grayish-black, and his eyebrows were longer than those of most Chen Family members. The traits that were all too familiar. Li Qiuyang had dealt with this type for nearly a century. It was unmistakably the characteristics of someone from the main Li Family.
"This child is quite interesting. He has inherited the cunning and intelligence of both the Li and Chen families without omission. No wonder Xijun asked me to take a closer look… he is indeed extraordinary!" said Li Qiuyang. He then paused for a moment before continuing, "Qingdu’s intention is for this child to follow Donghe in cultivation."
These words instantly shocked the couple. They exchanged glances and saw joy reflected in each other’s eyes. They had long harbored this idea. Chen Yang was the most talented child in the family and should have been placed under Chen Donghe’s tutelage for careful instruction.
However, the Chen Family had always maintained a clean reputation, never engaging in actions that might arouse suspicion. Moreover, Chen Donghe never returned to the Chen Family and held no attachment to past ties. So they had kept this thought buried deep within their hearts.
After all, Chen Donghe was at the late stage of Qi Cultivation, and among the outsiders in the family, his status was second to none. It was even said that he had learned the Li Family’s sword techniques. Chen Mufeng’s joy was evident as he reached out to pull the child forward to express their gratitude, but Chen Donghe interrupted and said, "You two shouldn’t celebrate too soon. I’ve rejected the proposal."
The atmosphere suddenly turned cold. Chen Yang’s eyes flickered slightly, and he lifted his chin, frowning at the words. He felt a faint throbbing in his forehead once again.
Yet, this subtle expression made the two elders seated above pause. A thought swiftly flashed through Chen Donghe’s mind, He has pride.
Putting on the demeanor of a seasoned elder, Chen Donghe spoke softly to Madam Li beside him, "I see that this child’s heart is not entirely righteous. The main family has proposed this arrangement multiple times, but I have rejected it each time."
As soon as these words were spoken, Madam Li understood the situation. She stepped forward, took the child’s hand, and said solemnly, "Swear the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath… in the presence of these two esteemed elders."
The mother and son went through the motions. Chen Yang’s expression remained as calm as still water as he repeated whatever his mother instructed him to. Li Qiuyang tapped his smoking pipe, while Chen Donghe silently observed the child’s reaction. Then, stepping down from the steps, he took Chen Yang’s hand and led him out of the hall.
He walked all the way to the riverside and sat down with Chen Yang. He began recounting the history from Chen Erniu’s flight to Lijing to the current state of affairs. Then, in a quiet voice, he said, "Our Chen Family only exists today because of the kindness that the Li Family’s ancestor has shown us. Generation after generation, we have been entrusted with great responsibilities. This is how we have come to our current standing. Unity benefits both families, but conflict would only bring pain to those who are related to us. You must not have any ill intentions."
Chen Yang’s expression seemed to soften slightly. He pursed his lips and, after a brief pause, murmured, "Yang’er understands. The main family’s grace and authority are immense."
When these words reached Chen Donghe’s ears, he could only interpret them as, Elder, Yang’er understands. The main family has many cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm and even connections with the Immortal Sects and the Purple Mansion. I won’t do anything foolish.
Chen Donghe sighed, pulled him up, and said in a firm tone, "Beyond this hall lies Moongaze Lake. Our Chen Family has always relied on the kindness of the main family. If you ever act against them in the future, let heaven bear witness. Your body and soul shall be destroyed."
Chen Yang stared at him blankly, then glanced at the darkening night sky. He had no choice but to repeat the words as instructed.
Chen Donghe, now weary of the matter, waved his hand lightly and said in a low voice, "Go back now!"
The young man hesitated with every step, glancing back repeatedly at the man the entire Chen Family revered and relied upon. Finally, he turned away and disappeared.
Chen Donghe remained by the lakeside for a while. Soon, Li Qiuyang returned from the mountain with his report. The wind technique he used was weak and unstable, causing him to waver unsteadily in the air. Seeing this, Chen Donghe quickly supported him, guiding him safely to the shore. Li Qiuyang stroked his beard and said softly, "Thank you, Donghe."
There were few in the Li Family who could address Chen Donghe in such a manner. Chen Donghe nodded silently in acknowledgment as Li Qiuyang spoke softly, "This crippled body of mine was burned by Merging Fire. Whenever it rains or if it's windy, the pain is so excruciating that I cannot even speak. It feels as if I am being torn apart, my mana utterly depleted. Even now, I can barely control the wind to travel."
Li Qiuyang had long avoided meeting people, and despite Chen Donghe’s repeated attempts to visit, he had never been granted an audience. Now that they had finally met, it was clear that the past years of imbalanced wind and rain had not been kind to Li Qiuyang. Unable to hold back, Chen Donghe cursed angrily, "That wretched Xu Family brat!"
"There is no need for that, Donghe." Li Qiuyang said in a low voice, "At our age, there is no longer any such thing as what is wretched or not. He was a once-in-a-generation talent who never committed any heinous crimes, yet he was killed because of me. The retribution should fall upon me instead."
There was a deep sense of acceptance on his face, leaving Chen Donghe at a loss for words. After a long silence, Li Qiuyang looked at him deeply and finally said, "Since Jingtian’s passing, five of your seven souls have gone with her. There is no light left in your eyes. The younger generation might not notice it, but I know you. The Chen Donghe I knew was never like this."
Chen Donghe found himself speechless once more. Li Qiuyang, with his head bowed slightly, walked alongside him by the lakeside in the quiet night. After a long while, Chen Donghe murmured, "I was by her side for over sixty years. She… got used to it."
Li Qiuyang sighed lightly, his expression wavering with emotion, and in a hoarse voice, he said, "Donghe… why do this to yourself? Forget Xuanxuan, even I understand her to some extent. Habit, that’s all it was. She was born without a spiritual orifice… she saw her entire life as suffering. How could she have ever truly loved anyone?"
Chen Donghe’s usually unshaken expression finally wavered with intense emotion. In a soft voice, he said, "In the end, this is my burden alone."
Li Qiuyang replied, "All I see is that you can’t move on! You have over a hundred years of life left… If you are just going to continue like this, a walking corpse, then you might as well have died with her back in Mount Yue!"
Chen Donghe came to a slow stop in the dark, remaining silent. A familiar figure emerged in his mind. He had been with her from childhood to adulthood, from life to death, through marriage and raising a daughter. It seemed that everything had gone as he had wished. He had helped her fulfill her desires, tying up all loose ends. He himself had become lost in it.
But there was one truth he had always known, one he had deliberately pushed to the back of his mind. Yet, like a shadow, it had never truly left him. It manifested in countless lingering thoughts. And now, it finally took form.
Li Jingtian had seemed grateful to him, had trusted him, had been willing to marry him and bear his child. But never, not even once, had she looked at him the way a wife looks at her husband.
He had known all along. Even though she was a mortal, as fragile as tofu in his hand, she still resisted with unyielding, near ruthlessness against everything she did not love.
