The colossal vessel continued to sail at full speed deeper into the Domain Battlefield, shrouded in complete darkness. The corrupted beasts of the land no longer hid in ambush, and the black mountains stretched endlessly, exuding a terrifying aura.
Each of them was preoccupied with their own tasks. If any Nascent Soul-stage corrupted beast blocked their path, twelve terrifying figures would emerge simultaneously, unleashing a God-killing storm that swept across the heavens and earth, uprooting the black mountains entirely!
Little Red's body grew larger at the rear of the vessel, clutching the God-killing Stone to absorb the frigid, sinister energy from the black mountain veins—tearing it away with ease!
At this moment, the sense of aversion from heaven and earth intensified, causing them a slight discomfort throughout their bodies. This place was already capable of shaking the mind and spirit of a Nascent Soul creature.
Today, the endless sky above glowed with a grayish-blue light, casting a bleak and eerie glow upon the black earth.
The Domain Battlefield had no sun or moon. No one knew where this gray-blue light originated from. It felt as if it had sunk into a vast, dark sea, oppressive and suffocating.
As Chen Xun and his companions stood atop the crane's head, the system's notification for stat allocation suddenly echoed in their minds.
Chen Xun exchanged a glance with the big black ox, silently and instinctively allocating points to defense. It was as if this seemingly futile upgrade could offer them a sliver of security.
Little Red's body had grown significantly, trembling slightly from time to time. The frigid aura here was profoundly deep as if they were being engulfed by despair, unable to glimpse even a ray of hope.
Rustle... rustle...
The Crane Spirit's Five Elements Tree swayed incessantly, seemingly a bit frightened. The corrupted beasts of the land fixated their gazes upon the colossal living vessel, unmoving, staring at it with unyielding intensity.
Massive black mountains loomed into view intermittently, their overwhelming aura of hatred completely locking onto them.
"Living beings!!!"
"How dare you trespass here!!"
"KILL!!!"
Three thunderous, wrathful voices echoed from all directions. The monstrous aura of hatred struck terror into any living creature. The surging waves of corrupted blood emanated from three early-stage Nascent Soul-corrupted beasts!
"Moo!!"
"How dare you, corrupted scum, shout at Brother Xun?!"
Little Red hid behind the big black ox, roaring furiously, his voice booming.
"Roar, roar!"
In the distance, the three humanoid corrupted beasts stared at them with bloodthirsty gleams in their eyes, even showing traces of excitement, offering no response.
They streaked across the sky, their blood-red light like ribbons, howling toward the giant vessel. The air was filled with the violent roar of corrupted blood—the Lifespan Severing Art!
Electricity crackled around Chen Xun, his silver hair dancing as a strange light flickered in his eyes. He wanted to test his Profound-Grade Sitting Oblivion Talisman.
Two terrifying figures slowly emerged beside him. In unison, their palms struck together, instantly launching from the giant vessel!
Lightning tore through the sky. Three black talismans instantly activated, transforming into long rainbows that shot toward the corrupted beasts, appearing right before the three Nascent Soul-corrupted beasts.
Chen Xun sneered coldly, pointing two fingers through the void. An invisible surge of vital energy from heaven and earth trembled and burst forth, pressing down alongside the talismans like a mountain!
"What is this?!"
"Vital energy—it's the life force of a living being!"
"No, it's… our corrupted blood!"
The three corrupted beasts trembled in fear as if witnessing their worst nightmare. Corrupted beasts lacked vital blood, yet they were seeing vital energy fused with corrupted blood!
The talismans were unstoppable. They hadn't simply traveled through space but had materialized along the energy veins of the Domain Battlefield!
Boom! Boom! Boom!
The three talismans erupted simultaneously. The corrupted beasts' expressions changed drastically. The talismans chased after their corrupted blood as if locked onto them. Their corrupted blood churned wildly within.
Their bodies stiffened and corrupted blood gushed from their seven orifices. Their auras rapidly withered as if they were being devoured by their own corrupted blood, their own Lifespan Severing Art turning against them!
The karmic backlash of their own spell began to take root invisibly upon them.
"Not good!!"
Panic-stricken, their hearts churned with monstrous fear. They suddenly raised their heads sharply, staring in terror at the silver-haired man at the center. His eyes were cold, and his lips curled into a faint, mocking smile.
They were... severing themselves?!
"A human? Impossible!"
"He's not human!"
"Who are you?!"
"Your long-lost father."
"Impossible! Our kind is born of heaven and earth. How could we be related to the filth of living beings?"
The three corrupted beasts, tormented by the backlash of the Sitting Oblivion Talisman, grew increasingly delirious. Their faces twisted in agony. If this continued, they would undoubtedly die from their own corrupted blood!
They exchanged a terrified glance, their bodies trembling. Their gaze toward Chen Xun was filled with utter dread, devoid of any hatred.
Swish!
Just as they turned to flee, a black axe light cleaved down from the heavens. They only saw a blur, followed by endless corrupted blood erupting skyward—their own.
The three Nascent Soul-corrupted beasts trembled violently, letting out a soul-shattering, anguished wail. In the blink of an eye, they were slain, unable to even resist.
The three figures remained expressionless, calmly collecting the corrupted Nascent Soul blood.
Their casual glances swept across the corrupted beasts on the ground. The latter trembled violently, their consciousness instantly erased by the God-killing Storm.
For hundreds of miles, the corrupted beasts shrieked and retreated. The silver-haired man in the sky was not a living being!
Boom!
Suddenly, a tremor shook the earth, and large groups of corrupted beasts instinctively began to flee. They intended to deal with the living beings they hated, not this kind of ghostly entity!
On the giant vessel, the big black ox and Little Red were both stunned, their eyes filled with shock. Their big brother was growing stronger and stronger.
One talisman could seal a Nascent Soul early-stage corrupted beast—who would believe it if they heard it?
Especially the big black ox, who deeply felt it. This was even easier than when they had slain the Liao family back when they were at the Qi Refining stage.
It was said that the higher the cultivation realm, the stronger the magical power and the more methods available, making it harder to die.
But their growth had been exponential, and the threshold for eternal life points was steadily rising.
In the end, they would only continue to crush others at the same level as their realm increased.
"Moo moo~~"
The big black ox let out a heavy breath, staring wide-eyed at the silver-haired Chen Xun in the distance.
Little Red had completely surrendered. In this Domain, there was no one it would bow to except Brother Xun—no one could defeat him. After all, it hadn’t even seen Brother Xun go all out yet.
Chen Xun’s expression remained calm as he waved his hand to slay three Nascent Soul-corrupted beasts, his eyes still as emotionless as a tranquil lake.
The path of cultivation was vast and endless. Who knew how many brilliant young prodigies and ancient elders still lay ahead? One must never become arrogant; that was a grave taboo in the pursuit of eternal life.
Unconsciously, he glanced at Little Red, fully understanding the blood-transformation technique. He also realized that Little Red was actually from the Jiang family, but this technique still required further research.
Gathering the blood of all tribes, when the rootless vital energy flower truly took form, perhaps he could give it a try!
"Old Ox, Little Red, Little Crane, let’s go!"
"Moo moo!"
"Roar!"
Rustle... rustle...
Boom!
The giant vessel transformed into black and white streaks of light and continued moving in a straight line toward the deeper region. The gray-blue light in the sky grew denser.
Meanwhile, the corpses of the three Nascent Soul-corrupted beasts began to mutate after they had passed, the effect of the Sitting Oblivion Talisman continuing even after death!
Their shriveled bodies could not merge with the black earth and were slowly disintegrating, vanishing from the world...
One year later, the speed of the giant vessel began to slow, and the killing intent within was overwhelming. Behind it was an endless sea of corpses, mountains of blood, and countless corrupted beasts who had been slain.
Chen Xun and the big black ox had already summoned their life-bound magical treasures, even beginning to see red in their rage. Around them was the violent, spinning Starfall Wheel, with blinding red light filling the sky, searing hot.
Boom!
The earth rumbled grandly, with massive black mountains exploding in all directions. The air was filled with the terrifying cries, mourning, and hatred of corrupted beasts—more and more, and the killing seemed endless...
The number of corrupt beasts was enough to instill despair. Even Little Red had hidden under Little Crane, afraid to even breathe.
Buzz—
The space trembled, and the giant vessel suddenly stopped in midair. The Crane Spirit’s Five Elements Tree shed its branches, and the view ahead was fully revealed.
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged a solemn look, their chests rising and falling slowly.
"Old Ox... we've arrived."
"Moo~~"
They slowly looked up, gazing in all directions. Their eyes showed intense shock and disbelief, remaining silent for a long time, their fingers trembling subconsciously.
Instinctively, they allocated more points to defense.
Chen Xun took a deep breath and put on his straw hat. "Old Ox, it’s time. Use that move."
The big black ox glanced at Chen Xun and nodded heavily. "Moo moo~~"
Their expressions grew increasingly cold, arcs of lightning streaking in all directions. Chen Xun’s black hair gradually turned silver, and his eyes continuously flickered with thunder.
At the same time, his immense Five Elements pressure surged, filling the world. Corrupted beasts in the distance, both on the ground and in the air, were instantly struck with terror!
Boom!
The big black ox’s black coffin trembled as it sat upon the Crane’s head. His thick fur began to grow inch by inch, his body hardening like divine stone, able to withstand even a strike from a black mountain!
At that moment, a massive Five Elements Void Formation disk appeared beneath the giant vessel, beginning to rotate slowly. The whole space trembled, with a deafening hum resonating.
A faint flow of Five Elements Qi began to roll in from all directions, and all the corrupted beasts’ eyes filled with hesitation, even showing signs of fear.
Boom!
Two beams of Five Elements divine light shot up from the giant vessel, ten figures standing in all directions. In the air, their eyes slowly opened, their expressions cold and piercing, as if their very gaze could pierce the soul. They nodded gently, striking their palms together!
In an instant, the entire black earth became suffused with a killing intent. Howls that seemed to come from ancient times echoed through the heavens and earth.
Twelve terrifying figures began to rise from the ground like blazing suns, casting their gaze upon the world, overshadowing the heavens...
The terrifying aura flooded the Domain Battlefield, echoing through the air. Little Red stood dumbstruck, staring in awe.
The gazes of the twelve figures fixed upon the front, their imposing presence overwhelming, carrying with them an unimaginable and violent Five Elements force.
Their eyes slowly narrowed, and in that moment, it felt as though they alone ruled the heavens and earth.
