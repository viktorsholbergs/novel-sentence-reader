Chen Xun stared blankly at everything around him, his heart aching as if pierced by a knife. He was at a loss, overwhelmed, and helpless.
The big black ox kept nuzzling Liu Yuan, mooing frantically. Liu Yuan's passing didn't just signify her death; it marked the end of everything. The pain cut deep, and bloodshot veins burst in Chen Xun's eyes.
A thousand years had passed, and the cycle of life continued. But those who were meant to leave had to go; once missed, it was forever.
The mountain was desolate, the night bleak, and the wind biting. The funeral bell of the Five Elements Sect rang long and mournfully. The disciples of each peak mourned the passing of Peak Master Liu.
On the cliff, Liu Yuan sat quietly on the ground, serene and graceful, Chen Xun remained silent for a long time, countless complex emotions flashing in his eyes before they settled into a lifeless stillness.
The grass around it turned yellow, and the last leaves on the branches fell silently. The bare branches trembled in the northern wind. It was unclear how much time had passed. As night deepened, Chen Xun's heart finally calmed, undisturbed.
"Old Ox."
"Moo~" The big black ox lifted its head slightly, looking at Chen Xun.
"Liu Junior Sister was right. Why bother seeing through everything? Meeting, knowing each other, and walking a part of the journey together—this is the greatest beauty." Chen Xun suddenly smiled warmly. "From now on, let's not avoid anything. Face it calmly; there's nothing to fear."
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox slowly walked to Chen Xun's side, nuzzling him.
He patted the ox's head and sighed softly, "No matter how sad it is, we brothers are still here, right?"
"Moo~" The big black ox looked intently at him and nodded.
Chen Xun slowly turned his head, gazing at the dark night sky, his eyes still filled with age-old sorrow. "You all will live on with us.”
"Moo~!!!"
The big black ox suddenly turned its head and roared, Chen Xun's words striking a chord. It wanted to accumulate supreme merit for their reincarnation!
Even if everyone else in the world forgot them, it and Chen Xun would not. They would not escape anymore.
"Heh, what does the cycle of life matter? Me and the old ox will live forever. We'll meet again someday." Chen Xun sneered coldly, slapping the big black ox, "Accumulate merit! Damn it, when the time comes, we'll find them all. None will escape!"
"Moo~~~!!" The big black ox trembled with excitement, frantically nuzzling Chen Xun.
By then, they would surely have the power to provide the elixirs needed for breakthroughs, no longer watching their friends pass away helplessly.
"Old Ox, let's go to Xianyin Mountain and greet them so they recognize us later."
Chen Xun waved his hand, and the surrounding area was illuminated by multicolored spiritual energy. "I've been too attached. This is the cultivation world; we are immortal, and anything is possible."
"Moo!" The big black ox became more excited as he spoke, its tail starting to wag.
The sorrowful atmosphere was swept away, their spirits suddenly becoming open and profound, as if they had overcome the final inner demon.
Two figures transformed into points of light, quietly disappearing from the spot.
The evening wind brushed past Liu Yuan's face, petals of various flowers from the valley drifting in the sky. The smile she left behind seemed to deepen.
...
The cold wind was bleak as Chen Xun and the big black ox climbed Xianyin Mountain.
The place was densely packed with tombstones, guarded by Foundation Establishment cultivators. Within the Five Elements Sect, they were like shadows, unnoticed and unchallenged.
Chen Xun and the big black ox spread their senses, walking slowly along the paths between the graves, searching carefully.
"Moo!" The big black ox called out; it had found it.
Chen Xun's eyes focused, following the ox to a relatively inconspicuous spot, though the surroundings were well-maintained.
Grave of Ji Kun, Outer Sect Elder.
"Moo, moo~~"
The big black ox immediately took out offerings of crane spirit wood and an incense burner from its storage bag and began performing rituals, very seriously. Chen Xun's eyes showed a hint of nostalgia as he sat beside the grave, his gaze filled with a trace of regret.
Back then, lacking the necessary strength, I didn't dare stay in the sect to accompany my brothers from Nine Stars Valley to their final journey.
And with my mindset at that time, even if I had the strength, I probably wouldn't have dared to stay, fearing to watch them die before my eyes.
"Brother Ji." Chen Xun's deep gaze turned to the distance. "You must have known, right? When you gave me that ancient book, I should have guessed."
He took out an ancient book from his storage bag, nameless, but with an ancient texture different from ordinary paper. Even with his current knowledge, he couldn't discern the material in this book.
"This, we brothers, will read together." Chen Xun turned and smiled, as if Ji Kun were standing right beside him. "I'll open it..."
_Rustle_
The first page slowly unfolded, and Chen Xun raised an eyebrow. It wasn't an ancient text on cultivation methods, but a large segment of obscure language. His expression grew serious. Although he couldn't understand it, he read it word for word.
The big black ox was still performing the rituals, with the magical effects at their peak. Previously, Chen Xun led the rituals; now he had to do it alone.
The wind howled and sweat beaded Chen Xun's forehead. Why couldn't he understand it? He turned page after page, exerting his utmost effort in translation, finding it a thousand times harder than understanding cultivation methods.
"Eh?!"As Chen Xun read, his eyes suddenly widened. "I understand the later parts!"
His lips trembled, the astonishment in his eyes growing. Finally, he muttered two words: "Holy... crap."
"Moo?!" The big black ox was also startled, rarely seeing such an expression on Chen Xun's face.
Its ritual time was sufficient, supplemented by items from the previous shop visit. It quickly placed the offerings properly and ran to Chen Xun's side.
"Old Ox, look!" He began reading with the big black ox.
"Moo!!" The big black ox's eyes widened like copper bells, snorting in astonishment. What Chen Xun understood, it understood too.
"The Ji family... they're not from here." Chen Xun's fingers trembled as he turned the pages, his voice shaking. "Brother Ji's ancestors were part of a grand family... from _another world_."
"Moo~~!!" The big black ox snorted continuously, its mind reeling from the sheer amount of information.
"Over there, Old Ox, there's a path!!" Chen Xun stood up abruptly, shouting in excitement, spittle flying. "Old Ox, there's a path over there!!!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox also stood up, his eyes filled with intense excitement. "Moo moo!"
"So that's it, that's it, stars falling like rain..." Chen Xun murmured repeatedly, recalling the depth in Brother Ji's eyes that night. He must have known something. "The phenomenon back then wasn't a coincidence!"
"Moo~~~" The big black ox was so excited that it jumped, its black face showing a reddish hue.
Their gazes were simultaneously focused, looking toward an infinitely distant place. Chen Xun spoke slowly, "Old Ox, by the Milky Way, the path is there."
The big black ox was overwhelmed with excitement. It was an unknown coordinate, but it had already ignited hope in their hearts.
A man, an ox, and a gravestone. Their gazes seemed to pierce through space and time, a majestic aura gradually emanating around them.
The road is long and arduous. Immortals must seek and explore the true meaning of life.
"Old Ox, Brother Ji wasn't bragging." Chen Xun looked at the big black ox and then at the gravestone. "Brother Ji, we understand your message."
"Moo!" The big black ox also looked at the gravestone, nuzzling it. They wouldn't let Brother Ji down.
Chen Xun bowed, and the big black ox lowered its head. Together, they bid farewell to Ji Kun, their eyes full of respect.
"Brother Ji, we will set off together to witness the great future."
"Moo moo~"
As the words fell, the two figures transformed into points of light, and the majestic aura dissipated with them.
