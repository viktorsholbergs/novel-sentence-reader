The Time Before Falling Asleep
* * *
Crackle, crackle, crackle…
In front of me is a brightly burning bonfire.
The irregularly swaying flames and the pleasant sound of twigs snapping create an indescribable atmosphere.
If I turn my face to the left, what’s there is a calm sea.
Right now, I’m having a bonfire on the sandy beach.
It’s quite late.
It’s already night.
However, the visibility is good.
Because the starry sky is twinkling brightly overhead, illuminating my night.
The light of those stars is reflected on the waveless sea surface.
Like a mirror.
It’s an extremely, extremely beautiful sight.
So beautiful that it feels like I might be sucked in.
I’ve gotten quite used to this clear starry sky that I even felt fear of when I first reincarnated.
I’ve gained enough composure to think, “What do you mean, a starry sky that sucks you in? I’ll suck you in instead, idiot.”
It’s because I’ve become strong.
But I still think it’s not enough.
There’s no problem with becoming strong.
If I’m being looked down on by a barnacle, I still have a long way to go.
I quietly clench my fist and vow to improve myself further.
<Ah, Emi! Look, the fish is getting burnt, you know? Isn’t it okay to eat it now?>
“………”
Geez, what’s with you, Extra-sama?
I was quietly and coolly making my resolve, you know.
You ruined the atmosphere!
<What resolve? Rather than a resolve that doesn’t fill your stomach, it’s the fish in front of you. Come on, stop grilling it!>
The fish is what I caught while I was swimming and playing after defeating the barnacle.
It’s a Hamejika Sea Bream.
It’s about the size of my head, but it’s still a juvenile.
<Come on, hurry up!>
Prompted by the noisy Extra-sama, I move the 【Black Tentacle】 that was piercing the Hamejika Sea Bream, stop grilling it, and bring it to my mouth.
I take a bite.
…It’s delicious.
<It’s irresistible. Juicy, and yet with a texture like chicken. It has a very good bite. As expected of the “Queen of Hamejika’s Fishing Grounds.”>
What’s with that nickname?
<Hamejika Sea Bream is called that by anglers. I saw it in the Fishing God’s isekai reincarnation broadcast.>
Hmmm.
After that, I enjoyed a quiet dinner while alternating between eating and grilling the fish.
* * *
And now, having finished my meal, I’m climbing a tree near the beach to get some sleep.
The name of this tree is West Hamejika Large Beach Rose.
It’s a giant beach rose that can reach a height of 30 meters.
The trunk is prickly, but my tough body doesn’t care about that level of resistance from the tree, so I forcefully climb it.
While climbing the tree, I find fist-sized red fruits, so I pluck them and eat them.
<These are also sweet and sour, and delicious.>
…Hmm, for me, it’s a bit so-so.
<Eh?>
Because Extra-sama says everything tastes good…
<What is it? Don’t make it sound like I have no taste.>
After climbing the tree while chatting with Extra-sama, I make a bed.
First, I find a thick branch extending horizontally and wrap my 【Black Tentacles】 around it.
Then I lie down on it and this time, while creating a slightly larger space, I wrap my 【Black Tentacles】 around my body, round and round…
When it becomes like a cocoon, my special bed is complete.
It’s a wonderful bed, warm, sturdy, and safe.
“………”
Before covering my head with 【Black Tentacles】 and completing the cocoon, I turn my face sideways and gaze at the surrounding scenery.
A beautiful starry sky and sandy beach.
Over there is a forest.
And on the other side of the forest… if you look closely, it’s a bit bright.
A fire is burning.
I wonder if there’s a village?
Maybe I should secretly take a peek tomorrow…
Sleepy, sleepy.
My eyelids are getting heavy.
I should sleep now.
At that moment.
<Today was really fun.>
Extra-sama suddenly said.
…That’s right.
It was fun.
Thanks to you, Extra-sama.
<Me?>
That’s right.
Playing at the beach is fun on its own, but it’s definitely more fun to play with two people than alone.
So the reason today was fun is thanks to you, Extra-sama.
Thank you, Extra-sama.
<…Ufufu, you don’t need to thank me for that.>
I will thank you.
Because I didn’t have any friends in my previous life.
I didn’t know that playing with someone could be so much fun.
That’s why I think I’m really glad that I was able to reincarnate into this world with you, Extra-sama.
<Emi…>
…Ah, let me correct that a bit.
Even in my previous life, just one.
I did have a friend.
<Huh, is that so? This is the first I’ve heard of it.>
Oh, is that so?
Did I not tell you…?
Um… her name was… Hikari Tasatonaka.
<…Tasatonaka Hikari, is it?>
Yes, Hikari-chan.
Hikari-chan was a transfer student.
She got lost on the way to the school she was going to attend for the first time.
<And that’s where you ran into her?>
That’s right.
She was a bright, energetic, and kind girl.
Unlike me, who was hated by everyone, she was a girl who was loved by everyone.
By chance, she was the same age as me and in the same class.
From the first day of her transfer, she quickly became the center of the class.
She was a girl who sparkled so much that it made you think this girl was loved by God.
<……>
She told me too.
She said, “Let’s be friends!”
…That was the first time for me.
Hikari-chan was definitely my first friend.
…But.
<But?>
Soon after transferring, Hikari-chan went missing.
No one knows where she went or what happened to her.
Even the police were at a loss about this case.
It was sad.
Everyone said things like, “Hikari-chan was cursed because she talked to me,” or “It’s your fault,” and blamed me as usual.
I lost my first friend before we could play together.
That was the saddest thing.
<…I see.>
…Well, it’s an old story.
Not even an old story, it’s a story from my previous life.
Anyway, I just wanted to say that I also had one friend!
Ah, I’m sleepy.
I’m done thinking about this!
<…Okay, I understand. Good night, Emi…>
Good night, Extra-sama…
I completely covered my head with 【Black Tentacles】 and completed the cocoon.
Now, even the starlight can’t reach me.
In the warm and peaceful darkness, I quickly let go of my consciousness and fell asleep.
