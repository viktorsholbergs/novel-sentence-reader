The King and the Monster
* * *
He was the “King”, dwelling in the western desert.
Living for a long, long time… before he knew it, his strength had grown stronger than anyone else living in the desert.
His skin became harder than anyone else’s.
His body became larger than anyone else’s.
There was no one who could rival him.
Once, there were.
Hot-blooded fools who challenged him for the throne.
They were large scorpions, dragons, or worms… but—
In the end, they were all just small fry who didn’t know their place.
He had buried all challengers in one blow, and used them as nourishment for his growth.
Now, there’s no one left in the western desert who dares to oppose him.
When they see him, they run away… or if they have some wits about them, they show their submission.
Some even offer sacrifices.
Anyway, it’s always like that.
Because of this, his life suddenly became boring.
He’s so bored, bored, he can’t stand it.
He longs for challengers… who were once so annoying.
So he decided to take care of things, to increase the number of challengers, even if just a little.
For example, catching promising magical creatures and feeding them to make them bigger.
For example, attacking settlements of magical creatures and brutally killing them to instill a desire for revenge.
He’s tried various things.
Come to think of it, he once destroyed a country of two-legged creatures, which existed in the western desert a long time ago.
This was also part of his plan to cultivate avengers.
After all, he’s the strongest, hardest, and biggest in the western desert.
He was free to do whatever he wanted.
…However, it’s hard to say that he achieved the desired results.
Although individuals who challenged him appeared here and there… they were all weak.
He just squashed them, and that’s it.
The two-legged creatures put up a good fight… but they haven’t challenged him in the last few hundred years.
They were a disappointment.
But as for the two-legged creatures… he was able to seize his favorite trophy, so he’s satisfied.
Anyway… his boring life continued.
…Until a month ago.
* * *
A month ago, the tower in the south of the desert apparently collapsed.
He doesn’t know what happened.
The instinct of ‘You must not approach that tower’ was instilled in the magical creatures of the desert, by some great being.
Well, the details don’t matter.
Anyway, the tower collapsed.
And then, a maddening stench spread, and it snowed.
And then.
An unidentified… “terrifying being” appeared in this western desert.
* * *
He, too, had noticed the presence of this being.
Ever since the tower collapsed, he had been feeling uneasy.
His survival instincts were warning him, ‘Run away.’
But since he’s the King.
He can’t just run away because he’s scared.
Rather, he scoffed at the magical creatures, including the giant worm, who fled first.
Do they have no pride as strong beings?
Yes.
That’s right.
He is the King.
It seems that the being that recently appeared is hunting and eating any magical creature it sees.
Was it okay to allow something like that?
He is the King, a strong being, and the western desert is his territory.
A newcomer, doing as they please in his territory without even a greeting!
He can’t forgive that!
Thinking that, he finally got off his lazy butt.
He moved his massive body and headed south, where the newcomer is said to be rampaging.
And there, he met the newcomer face-to-face for the first time.
Although he called it face-to-face. it was just seeing it from afar… that was all.
He… regretted it.
He deeply regretted coming here, driven by his foolish pride.
That newcomer… was a monster.
A terrifying, gruesome monster.
Its color is jet-black… and since it’s on the white sand, it stands out.
Its shape… from afar, it looked like a ball of fur.
But each strand of “fur” making up that ball is actually a thick tentacle, wriggling creepily.
A mass of tentacles.
Yes, that monster was a mass of tentacles.
When he met the newcomer, it was just about to attack a flock of lizards.
Although not as strong as him, those lizards are strong beings.
Their huge bodies are powerful, their fangs easily tear through the flesh of their prey, and they even have sharp thorns on their bodies.
Since they hunt in packs, ordinary magical creatures are no match for them.
That monster…
…Was slaughtering those lizards.
A tentacle shot out—Whoosh—and a lizard, its head easily pierced, died.
A tentacle shot out—Whoosh—and a lizard, its huge body split in two, died.
When two tentacles shot out—Whoosh, whoosh—a lizard, entangled by the two tentacles, was torn apart by terrifying strength, and died.
Anyway, that ball of tentacles was relentlessly killing the lizards.
Ignoring their cries for help, it killed them all.
And then, as a finishing touch, the ball of tentacles pierced its tentacles into the bodies of the slain lizards.
And then, the lizards’ bodies quickly withered and dried up.
It seems that’s how the ball of tentacles feeds.
Sometimes, it would pull the meatier lizards closer to its main body, and do something… as if lying on top of them…
But at those times, the entire lizard meat was covered by tentacles, so he couldn’t see what it was doing.
When the ball of tentacles moved again, the lizard’s flesh and bones were completely gone, so it probably ate them.
He doesn’t really understand the difference between this and feeding with the tentacles.
…He continued to observe, dumbfounded, and then—
He noticed that the ball of tentacles… the monster…
Was looking at him.
A terrifying, murderous intent was directed at him.
At that moment, he—
Compared to that ball of tentacles, he is—
Like a tiny tick.
That’s what he felt.
He instantly perceived the difference in their power.
So.
He screamed, turned around, and started running away at an astonishing speed!
No good!
That’s no good, he can’t win!
King or whatever, he can’t win against that!
He killed a few of his meatier subordinates who had followed him.
To use as bait for the ball of tentacles.
While that monster is busy devouring its prey, he alone would escape!
He has to escape!
With an uncontrollable fear of the terrifying ball of tentacles, and a burning rage at having his pride as King wounded, in his heart—
He ran north through the western desert.
Seeing his… the King’s unusual behavior, the other magical creatures also started running north.
Seeing those magical creatures, even more magical creatures started running away.
As a result of that chain reaction.
In the western desert… the Lair of Magical Creatures.
A stampede broke out, caused by a diverse horde of monsters… running with enough force to crush everything in their path!
