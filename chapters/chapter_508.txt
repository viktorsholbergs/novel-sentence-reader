He's from the Golden Feather Immortal Sect, huh…
Upon hearing that his surname was Zhang and taking in the attire he wore, Li Qinghong immediately understood that Zhang Yun wanted to remain incognito by referring to himself as a swordsman of Jiangnan, so she chose not to expose him.
Zhang Yun…
The name was familiar, and combined with his tone, it immediately brought someone to mind.
When Li Tongya infiltrated the Snake Demon Cave Dwelling back then, he had to share the spoils with a swordsman named Zhang Yun.
Zhang Yun picked the snake demon's inner core and the Blood Dharma Manual, while Li Tongya received the River Mountain Sutra and the Duruo Spear that she still wielded today.
Li Qinghong deduced that this was likely the same Zhang Yun from years past. Now, seventy or eighty years later, he was about to reach the Purple Mansion Realm.
This man… is a direct descendant of the three sects!
She cupped her fist and introduced herself.
"Greetings, Senior. I am Li Qinghong. Li Tongya is my grandfather."
"Ah, so you are the descendant of an old friend of mine," Zhang Yun replied, glancing at her while his golden robe fluttered in the wind.
"Your immortal foundation is good. The thunder talisman is decent, too. However, your spear technique is average. As for your escape techniques, spells, and secret arts, they lack substance. They might intimidate prominent clans since they are on par with those from the seven gates. Yet, against the Golden Feather and Azure Pond, they would struggle to prevail."
Li Qinghong nodded in acknowledgment. Zhang Yun studied the two of them, standing with his hands behind his back, and then inquired, "Since you know of my friendship with your elder, why don't you invite me in?"
After hearing this blunt request, Li Qinghong had no choice but to lead him inside. The Green Ox River Embrace Formation on Qingdu Peak was likely just mere decoration in his presence. If he had intended to harm her, he could have done so long ago.
Zhang Yun seemed oblivious to her concerns, or perhaps he simply did not care. He landed on the mountain, surveying the White Irises that peppered the landscape, and said softly, "Li Tongya… What a pity. When I heard he had broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm, I thought we would eventually have a formal duel! But it seems that chance has passed."
Li Qinghong remained cautious and held her tongue as she walked with Zhang Yun, who continued to muse aloud, "The younger generation taught by Li Tongya is quite impressive, far better than I was at their age. Although my three sons are gifted, they lack discipline since I'm always in long seclusions… They have grown into rather arrogant boys."
Zhang Yun seemed to suddenly realize he had strayed from the topic and quickly added, "But... I came here this time to remind you of one thing…"
"Don't concern yourself with Zhang Huaide's affairs or any other incidents occurring along the riverbank. I was sent to oversee this matter personally. I consider Li Tongya a friend, which is why I made this trip. Just take care of yourselves," he said.
Li Qinghong thanked him softly, but Zhang Yun suddenly stopped, standing with his hands behind his back as he asked, "The River Mountain Sutra is still in your family's possession, correct?"
After a brief pause, Li Qinghong replied, "Yes, Senior, that's correct."
Although Zhang Yun was no longer a young man, he still had a playful demeanor. With a smile, he simply commented, "Great."
Then, his expression shifted to one of curiosity as he asked, "Is the Wanglin Blossom also from your family?"
Li Qinghong was taken aback by the sudden question but quickly understood the implications.
It's said that the Wanglin Blossoms have been extinct in Jiangnan for hundreds of years. The three sects monitor everything in Jiangnan closely. They must have heard about my family suddenly acquiring one…
"Yes!" she replied respectfully.
Zhang Yun's demeanor turned serious as he pressed on, "Where did it come from?"
Li Qinghong's mind raced. Zhang Yun clearly understood the significance of the Wanglin Blossom, which was why he was inquiring about it. Yet, her family knew little about it.
This must be connected to the Wang Family!
Her family lacked critical information, and their status was not equal to that of the three sects. If she tried anything funny, it might backfire. Thus, Li Qinghong could only be as vague as possible in her response.
"It was left by a Daoist from the north. My family assisted him, and in gratitude, he gifted us with the spirit root."
Zhang Yun, who appeared somewhat frivolous moments ago, now looked very serious as he asked, "What is their cultivation level and surname?"
Li Qinghong hesitated before replying, "That senior is quite strange. He has a majestic aura, yet you can't discern his cultivation level. His surname... is Wang!"
She was smart, choosing her words carefully. While Wang Xun treated her as an equal, she respectfully referred to him as a senior. Hence, her description painted the picture of a formidable northerner, prompting a frown from Zhang Yun.
"I had a feeling his surname would be Wang!" he exclaimed, exhaling deeply as realization struck.
Wang Family of Yinghua Wang! A Golden Core Realm Clan!
Shocked, he asked in confusion, "That is an immortal clan from the north… How can someone from a small clan help him?"
"My elder left behind a sword named Qingche, which contains his sword intent. The senior merely wished to take a look at it," Li Qinghong explained softly.
Understanding dawned on Zhang Yun.
"Ah, yes, that's indeed the only rather interesting thing about your Li Family… Where is the sword?"
"It has been taken by my brother on his trip to the south," she replied.
Zhang Yun could only give up. He nodded, acknowledging the situation then suddenly chuckled softly, saying, "This is your family's opportunity, but don't overthink it... Wang Family of Yinghua is most afraid of being tainted by worldly karma. The fact he bestowed this spirit root upon your family means he has already calculated everything and ensured that your paths will not cross again!"
Li Qinghong raised an eyebrow slightly at his words, and Zhang Yun's clear eyes indicated he had seen through the calculations at play.
She sighed inwardly.
The direct descendants of the Golden Feather Sect are indeed difficult to deal with…
Unbeknownst to her, Zhang Yun felt a pang of regret as he thought to himself, So, it was given by the Wang Family of Yinghua! What a pity. Since the Wanglin Blossom is immensely useful, I intended to come to the Li Family to take this Foundation Establishment Realm spirit root for my own use at the sect... But it seems that I truly can't take it.
After all, the gift from the Wang Family of Yinghua represented a culmination of cause and effect. If Zhang Yun were to snatch it away after just a few years, the Wang Family would inevitably be displeased. Although the Foundation Establishment Realm spirit root was precious, it was not essential for Zhang Yun, and he had no desire to offend the Wang Family.
He looked at Li Qinghong and suddenly asked, "Has your brother also reached the Foundation Establishment Realm?"
Li Qinghong did not dare to lie about such an obvious question and simply nodded.
Zhang Yun smiled and murmured, "Interesting... interesting... Three generations of a family with five Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators—there must be something unusual about that."
After a moment's reflection, he continued, "Ning Tiaoxiao also personally arranged the marriage. He must have discovered something about the Li Family, hmm..."
"Li Qinghong... does your brother also practice Boundless Ocean?" Zhang Yun asked.
"Yes," Li Qinghong replied softly.
Zhang Yun chuckled and nodded.
"Good… very good!"
As soon as he finished speaking, he ignored the Li Family members entirely and enveloped himself in golden light. With that, he passed through their family's formation effortlessly and headed north on his own.
Li Qinghong bowed her head and saw him off, watching as he walked away laughing. It was only then did she release a sigh of relief, her back damp with sweat.
When she noticed Li Xicheng rushing into the yard, she said urgently, "Stop the news immediately. Don't let anyone know about Zhang Yun's visit!"
Li Xicheng nodded in agreement.
"Don't worry, Auntie… The fight just now happened too quickly! We only know that someone used a thunder spell. I'll inform everyone that you were practicing your spells."
