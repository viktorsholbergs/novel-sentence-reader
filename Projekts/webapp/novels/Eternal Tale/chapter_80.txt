They sat directly on the grass, with Chen Xun lying down, feeling the gentle breeze on his face, his eyes sinking into contemplation.
"Moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun.
"Old ox, do you want to hear my answer?"
"Moo~"
"My idea is that if it's our own family and friends, there's no need for a clear distinction between immortal and mortal."
Chen Xun said softly, "Humans experience so many separations and farewells due to life and death. Despite the temporary pain, everyone still lives happily. Suffering is just temporary; even ordinary people don't dwell on the past."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded heavily. They had sent off many people in the small mountain village, and the families of the departed lived well afterward.
"But the Foundation Establishment period only has a lifespan of four hundred years. If the influence of mortal emotions is too great, their master might worry that it hinders cultivation."
Chen Xun smiled faintly. He looked up at the sky, vast and clean, with clouds drifting like sails on the sea.
Continuing in a murmur, he said, "To sever mortal emotions... What is mortal emotion, anyway? We are all humans, and the world of cultivation is not much different from the mortal realm, full of worldly affairs and relationships."
"Moo!" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun vigorously; it wanted to hear something else.
"What's up?" Chen Xun pretended to be angry and confused.
"Moo!" The big, black ox snorted and nudged Chen Xun again.
"Okay!" Chen Xun became annoyed. "I know what you want to hear. Fine, I'll tell you!"
"Moo moo!"
"Your grandpa!" Chen Xun exclaimed in anger. He knew what the ox wanted to hear, and then he said, "I know you want to hear a story. Alright, I'll tell you!"
"Haha!"
Chen Xun burst into laughter. After exchanging a few more words, he suddenly disappeared.
"Moo!" The big black ox was furious and hurriedly chased after him. Chen Xun, however, evaded it.
From a distance, a man and an ox engaged in a fight, occasionally accompanied by a loud shout: "Old ox, we are different! We cultivate for longevity! Is it necessary to play with nesting dolls every day in the mortal world, sending people away and sighing like you? Am I bored after being full?!"
"Moo!" The big black ox roared, and Chen Xun was thrown into the sky.
"You son of a bitch!" Chen Xun exclaimed in anger. "I know what you want to hear. Alright, I'll tell you!"
"Moo moo!"
The big black ox grinned. It liked to listen to Chen Xun's stories and obediently stood beside him, no longer causing trouble.
"Ji Senior Brother’s matter involves life and death and is of a different nature. If handled well, it's just a small matter and won't affect much."
Chen Xun spoke without concern, "I don't seek reciprocity when dealing with friends, and I never expect anything in return."
"But regarding Senior Sister and Senior Brother’s situation, do you think I would casually give life advice to others?"
Chen Xun said with some disdain, "We cultivate for longevity, and our mindset cannot be the same as ordinary people! While others strive for success day by day, we don't compete or rob. We are not in the same world as them."
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox continued to please Chen Xun, understanding that it should not have caused trouble.
"Old ox, focus on cultivation. In the future, we'll make a breakthrough toward the imperial city. When that time comes, I'll buy you some good fabric to make clothes."
"Moo? Moo moo moo?!"
"That's definitely true. The imperial city has the best things. We'll broaden our horizons in the future. Haha!"
"Moo~~~!"
The big black ox jumped for joy, and Chen Xun, along with the ox, continued with their cultivation plan.
...
Suddenly, spring deepened, followed by early summer, then autumn's chill, and finally, winter's cold.
In the practice, time passed unnoticed. Since bidding farewell to Shi Jing and Liu Yuan, thirty years have swiftly gone by.
They had a brief moment of sadness upon returning, and Chen Xun comforted them with some words and prepared a delicious meal. Afterwards, they said their farewells and began their secluded cultivation.
Chen Xun and the big black ox finally understood a saying: cultivators spend a significant amount of time cultivating and seeking opportunities, and perhaps they might not live a more exciting life than ordinary people in a hundred years.
At the same time, in the past few years, a genius young man emerged in the Five Elements Sect, reaching the later stages of Foundation Establishment in less than a hundred years!
However, nobody thought about the aspect of spiritual roots because the Five Elements Sect publicly claimed this person to be a young girl.
But this individual was arrogant and domineering, looking down on the cultivators of the same generation in the Five Elements Sect. He even challenged the older generation of cultivators, but after being admonished by the peak masters, he became much more obedient.
However, wherever he went, there was a flurry of exclamations, and junior brothers and sisters all pursued him closely.
In the eyes of many Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Five Elements Sect, this person's behavior was frowned upon, and they were not fond of him.
However, judging from his demeanor and tone, Chen Xun and the big black ox thought he seemed like a child who hadn't experienced the harsh realities of society.
The difference between those who have and haven't integrated into the world is indeed vast. Living longer did not necessarily lead to a mature mindset. For example, a child who remained still for a thousand years might not have changed in terms of mentality and experience.
However, for Chen Xun and the big black ox, this was just a trivial matter. Chen Xun was already recognized as the weakest in terms of combat ability within the Foundation Establishment circle. Even the spells he practiced were from the Qi Refining period.
Moreover, their cultivation techniques were quite common, and ordinary people were not targeted by geniuses and strong cultivators. They quietly performed their duties in the Five Elements Sect.
They had initially planned to allocate all the immortal points to spiritual energy over these thirty years, but when they reached 51, they discovered that there was no warmer stream circulating in their bodies. They realized that the Foundation Establishment period indeed had a threshold.
They had no choice but to allocate the remaining immortal points to defense. This was crucial for enhancing their cultivation techniques and spells and protecting their meridians.
Their current immortal points were: Strength 21, Speed 21, Essence of All Things 20, Spiritual Energy 51, and Defense 32.
Chen Xun and the big black ox had never thought of themselves as particularly strong or that they needed to forge themselves through constant battles. Even though their spell bonuses had reached a terrifying level...
Walking through the world, content with ordinariness, they didn't actively provoke others. Being capable of self-preservation was enough; they didn't need to prove an invincible Dao heart. Their aspirations were not in that direction.
Today, in the spirit medicine garden, Chen Xun's expression was calm. As he stepped out of the cave, ripples suddenly echoed behind him. Virtual shadows appeared, as if there were invisible roars and tremors.
A slight breeze swept across the surrounding grasslands. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived at the entrance of the medicine garden, seamlessly merging with the five elements of heaven and earth. A step was like a short distance to the ends of the earth.
"Moo~" The big black ox called softly, silently appearing beside Chen Xun. Though its speed was fast, there was no longer that piercing sound.
"Old ox, let's go." Chen Xun smiled faintly.
"Moo~" The big black ox held a rope in its mouth and handed it to Chen Xun.
Their vast spiritual energy surged within them, and their mental power had greatly increased. They were now mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators!
However, Foundation Establishment Pills were no longer effective, and they could not continue to advance.
Chen Xun and the big black ox glanced at each other. The spiritual energy within them gradually decreased, and their realms slowly began to decline. Ultimately, their cultivation had only advanced slightly compared to when they first broke through.
Walking on the road, Chen Xun spoke, "Old ox, after these years of reflection, I've finally determined a direction."
"Moo?"
"One spell, one body-refining technique, one body movement technique, one cultivation technique, three Mountain-Crushing Axes, and several divination techniques. Temporarily, that should be sufficient."
Chen Xun's lips curled into a mysterious smile. "Greedy accumulation leads to nothing. For example, starting with the Fireball Technique, endlessly improving!"
By integrating various minor spells and exploring new ones, he had tried for many years without any signs of success. He had not reached this level yet.
However, in terms of improvement, after practicing so many spells and exploring according to that route, he had grasped a hint of inspiration and had already begun practicing.
