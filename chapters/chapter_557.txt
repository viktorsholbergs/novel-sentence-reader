Li Ximing stood with his hands behind his back, and Li Xijun, watching in awe, praised, "Wow, a Grade Four cultivation technique is truly impressive!"
However, Li Ximing said, "It's hard to say… My immortal foundation follows the path of suppression and annihilation. The Boundless Ocean at home aligns with the Pit Water system, which isn't as forceful or destructive. So… they're very different. If I have to make a comparison, I'd say it's almost as powerful as our aunt's Profound Thunderpool."
At this point, Li Xijun's mind wandered, and he whispered, "Our family's informants overseas reported something interesting—the Bright Yang Essence has a Dao Partner known as the Bright And Clear Heart, originating from an immortal island on Qunyi Island… You might want to take note of that."
Li Ximing chuckled and shook his head.
"I've just broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, and I don't even have any Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique yet. Why would I bother about Dao Partners right now?" he retorted rather playfully.
"Perhaps it's a clue to start looking!" Li Xijun replied.
He paused before continuing to explain softly, "After all, acquiring a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique is nearly impossible. Even if one happens to obtain it, it would be heavily encrypted... I've discussed this with our aunt, and she believes this is the case too. If our family truly decides to follow the Bright Yang path, we must gather more relevant spells and techniques, then brainstorm on how to proceed from there..."
Reaching the crux of the matter, he shifted to using mana to transmit his words.
"Our family possesses a Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique manual—the Aged Courtly Path Scripture. Xizhi is in the sect, so he can access information relevant to the Purple Mansion Realm. While he can't share the techniques with us, he can use them as a reference to write some content for the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual... Then, you can build upon it... with the help of Li Encheng as well as the Yuan and Xiao families.
"The cultivation techniques we write ourselves will surely have many gaps... In the end, we might have to resort to the Deng Family's method—filling those gaps with human lives over and over again... After several breakthroughs, eventually, we can attempt to reach the Purple Mansion Realm..."
Li Ximing stayed silent, stretching out his hand. The pass on the mountain then reverted into streams of light and returned to him.
"The cave has been revealed," he announced.
Li Xijun pressed his lips together, following Li Ximing. As soon as they entered the cave, they heard the sounds of gurgling water. His eyes glowed with a cold light, allowing him to see everything within the cave clearly.
He soon spotted jagged rocks along the underground river, with a red rock perched at its highest point. It was the size of an ordinary table or stool, glowing brightly, and on its surface were etchings with intricate white lines that were strikingly beautiful.
On top of the red rock was a palm-sized golden stone slab that was about the thickness of a finger. It seemed unremarkable at first glance, but was silently emitting a soft golden and white light.
Li Xijun studied the object for a while but could not figure out what it was. He turned to Li Ximing, who also appeared confused.
With a sigh, Li Ximing lamented, "Our family's rise within less than a hundred years has been too swift. Although we have several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators now, we are still largely ignorant about these matters..."
"It's not a problem. As long as we have secured it, we can always ask someone we trust for guidance," Li Xijun responded calmly.
He drew the Hanlin Sword from his waist. He hesitated for a moment, then refrained from using it on the rock and said, "We don't know the origin of this object, nor how to preserve or store it without damage. If we cut it hastily, we risk harming the treasure. It's better to leave it here, in this cave, and seal it with a formation."
Li Ximing paused, then nodded in agreement, feeling that Li Xijun's suggestion made sense. Together, they sealed the cave, set up a formation to conceal it, and made their way home.
"I'll ask my brother to send a team to guard this place," Li Xijun decided.
The two were about to land when they spotted a middle-aged man waiting outside. He seemed proud and aloof with his cultivation at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and he was dressed in a yellow and white Daoist robe from the Profound Peak Gate.
Li Ximing recognized him immediately and greeted him with a warm smile.
"Ah, it's you, fellow Daoist Gusun… What brings you to Moongaze Lake?"
The man was Kong Gusun, a cultivator from Profound Peak Gate. He had accompanied Kong Tingyun to Wutu Peak to open up the fire vein and was well-acquainted with Li Ximing.
Despite his cold expression, Kong Gusun was actually a warm person born with a stoic face. He smiled and replied hoarsely, "Ah… fellow Daoist Ximing! I've come to bring you some good news!"
Li Ximing walked up to him curiously and asked, "What do you mean?"
Kong Gusun politely cupped his fist before continuing, "My uncle was guarding the sect yesterday when he encountered a group of Azure Pond Sect cultivators entering the sea from Lake Xian. It turned out that the leader of that group was Senior Li Xuanfeng from your esteemed clan… He's finally returned from the southern border!
"My uncle also mentioned that Li Xuanfeng had an otherworldly and formidable aura. His cultivation had reached the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, and he was clad in black armor, carrying a golden bow, like a god descending to earth!"
Li Ximing and Li Xijun exchanged startled looks.
"Second Granduncle has returned from the southern border?!"
The southern border was a deadly place for many clan cultivators, where most perished fighting demons. The Li Family had long since lost hope that Li Xuanfeng would ever return.
Years earlier, when Li Xuanfeng broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm and earned the trust of Daoist Master Yuan Su, there had been a brief spark of hope. The family was excited by the treasures he sent home and eagerly awaited his return, believing that they might one day be reunited.
But Yuan Su never permitted his return. More than a decade had passed, and Li Xuanfeng was still stuck in the southern border. Hope slowly faded over time. Hence, the surprise in their hearts was indescribable when they heard this news.
Kong Gusun observed the expressions on their faces and knew that his uncle's words had struck a chord. With a scan of his spiritual sense, his eyes widened as he exclaimed in awe, "Ximing, you've established your foundation?!"
Li Ximing's face lit up with joy, and he waved his hand dismissively.
"It was just a stroke of luck, hardly worth bringing it up for discussion."
Li Xijun could not afford to linger around any longer. He left Li Ximing behind to entertain Kong Gusun while he soared into the air and headed toward the town to find Li Xuanxuan.
That old man will surely be overjoyed when he hears this news!
A smile spread across his face at the thought. He still remembered the old man's kind and sincere expression after he took the trip to Hengzhu Dao Gate.
Once he arrived, Li Xijun hurriedly pulled Li Xuanxuan away from his desk where he had been busy drawing talismans, and relayed the good news.
"What?!"
Li Xuanxuan's face flushed bright red with excitement almost right away. He immediately flew up, calling for the younger generation to join him as he rushed toward Qingdu to ask Kong Gusun for more details.
Kong Gusun, taken aback by the sudden crowd, spilled out a stream of praises for Li Xuanfeng.
As Li Xuanxuan's delighted laughter echoed through the air, he turned to the younger cultivators standing beside him and said proudly, "I knew it! This younger brother of mine has always been extraordinary! When Second Uncle was still alive, he used to say that Xuanfeng was the most talented of the Xuan generation—and he was right all along!"
The old man had not felt this happy in a long time. He eagerly pulled Kong Gusun closer and asked, "Which part of the Eastern Sea is my young brother in now?"
"He should be at Splitreed Island's marketplace," Kong Gusun replied.
With that, Kong Gusun cupped his fist politely and prepared to take his leave, and the group of people saw him off.
Li Xuanxuan looked at Li Xijun eagerly and ventured, "Maybe… I can go to the Eastern Sea...?"
Li Xijun smiled at the old man's cautious demeanor and replied, "Granduncle... the Eastern Sea is full of dangers. It's too risky for you to go alone. You should perish the thought!"
