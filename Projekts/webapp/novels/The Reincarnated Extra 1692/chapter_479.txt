【Tales of the Gods 19】Watotkanbishi, the Sky God
* * *
An endless sea of clouds.
And looking up, there’s a clear blue sky.
Judging by the brightness, it’s daytime… but strangely enough, stars are twinkling in that blue sky.
A single, thick, black trunk of a dead tree stretches out, piercing through the thick clouds, in that space.
The dead tree branches into two near its top, and a giant bird’s nest, made of collected twigs, is built at that junction.
This is the divine realm of Watotkanbishi, the Sky God… and the giant eagle, perched on the bird’s nest, eternally shining golden as if bathed in the morning sun, is the lord of this realm.
“Faaaaaaaah…”
Watotkanbishi, the Sky God, yawned here, flapping his wings as if stretching.
Floating in front of him is a thin board.
On it, against a backdrop of Takataka and Air’s smiling faces as they soared through the sky again, the single word ‘Fin’ is displayed, large and bold.
“Task complete… Haaaaaaaah…”
Yes… that thin board is a video editing display.
Watotkanbishi has just finished editing the final episode of 【Small Mouse Flying In The Sky】.
“Haaaaaaaah…”
The tension leaves him, and his body involuntarily relaxes.
He’s suddenly hit with drowsiness.
He yawns repeatedly.
And… a sense of accomplishment from completing the video arises.
Normally, at this moment, he’d also feel a sense of excitement… ‘How well will this video be received when I upload it!?’
That excitement is very pleasant.
He wants to enjoy that feeling.
That’s one of Watotkanbishi’s major motivations for making isekai reincarnation broadcasts.
However, at this moment, Watotkanbishi can’t bring himself to feel that way.
Because he…
Is incredibly dissatisfied with how 【Small Mouse Flying In The Sky】 turned out.
The cause of that…?
It’s needless to say—it’s Emi—who suddenly barged in at the climax of the story, and completely messed up the plot.
“Damn it… that cursed child…”
There are many things Emi messed up, but they can be broadly classified into three categories.
First, she defeated all the enemies.
This robbed Takataka of his chance to grow, and he was forced to resolve the situation at the last minute, abruptly and conveniently, by bestowing divine power upon him.
If you look at it as a hero’s growth story, it ended up being a rather questionable development.
Watotkanbishi is a rather meticulous person, and he’s confident in his foreshadowing.
And yet, Emi ruined almost all the events he had carefully prepared for.
Despite the fact that the setting was the Sky Kingdom, which floats in the air, an environment isolated from the outside world, making it difficult for uninvited guests to intrude.
He could only hold his head in his hands.
And second, she kept appearing on screen, dramatically increasing the amount of work Watotkanbishi had to do when editing the video.
That cursed child with black hair and black eyes didn’t appear at all in Takataka’s story.
There was no sign of her.
Such a mysterious girl was completely ‘foreign’ to the story, an incredibly annoying existence.
On the day the Sky Kingdom fell, many people commented to Emi ‘…Who are you?’, but seriously, who the hell is that girl?
And according to the ‘Ardyst’ video distribution rules, “humans with black hair and black eyes are not allowed to appear on screen”.
Watotkanbishi thinks it’s a stupid rule… but if he doesn’t follow it, his work will be censored.
It’ll be immediately deleted by the Censorship God.
So Watotkanbishi has been editing out Emi, little by little, from all the scenes she appeared in.
He cut the scenes entirely, or edited them to erase Emi’s figure…
It was truly a hellish task.
And third…
Peeーーー! Peeーーー! Peeーーー!
At that moment…
A high-pitched sound, like a chick begging for food, came from the thin display floating before Watotkanbishi.
He received an email.
“…………”
Watotkanbishi, frowning, pecked the display with his beak, and displayed the email confirmation screen.
And what he saw there was a new email, with no subject.
The sender’s name is… Technology God.
“Him again.”
Watotkanbishi, exasperated, deleted the email without even reading it.
The content is probably the same as the previous emails.
Something like ‘Why did Neverfall fall?’, or ‘Will you take responsibility?’.
The Technology God, along with the Magic God, the Medical God, and the now-deceased Machine God, is one of the representative gods who increased their divinity through the benefits of the super ancient magical civilization… and then declined after the ‘Day of Ruin’.
Lately, it seems that this god has been trying to improve his divine power through other means, such as the ‘Movement to Introduce a Status System and Skill System to Ardyst’, and the ‘Gamification of the World Movement’… but none of these efforts seem to be going well.
In other words, the admiration, trust, etc., that people have for ‘amazing technology’, the power source of his traditional power—in other words, the technology of the super ancient magical civilization, is a right that the Technology God must protect…
And the fall of Neverfall, a relic of the super ancient magical civilization, is a major problem he can’t overlook.
But Watotkanbishi doesn’t know what to do, even if he receives complaints.
After all, he filmed his broadcast in Neverfall, but in his scenario, there was no plan for Neverfall to fall.
It’s all the fault of that cursed child who acted rashly and completely destroyed Atmo Sphere.
In other words, ‘making Neverfall fall’ is Emi’s third blunder.
“…………”
Watotkanbishi, his drowsiness gone, replaced by irritation as he thought about all this, pecked the display and opened a certain website.
It’s a website where gods can create threads on various topics and exchange opinions… a so-called bulletin board site.
This time, his broadcast schedule was completely messed up by that mysterious cursed child.
What has happened has happened, and there’s nothing he can do about it.
But still…
…He wants to complain a little.
The upload time for his video, which he announced beforehand, is still a while away.
So without thinking too deeply, Watotkanbishi created a new thread.
‘A mysterious human completely messed up my isekai reincarnation broadcast’.
That was the thread title.
This concludes Arc 20 of ‘The Reincarnated Extra’.
Thank you for reading.
It was a story that was created as a result of not overthinking things, and just including whatever came to mind.
I hope you enjoyed it.
The next arc will be uploaded around the end of April.
