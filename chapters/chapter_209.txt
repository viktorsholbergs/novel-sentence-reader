Seeing that Xiao Chuchou and the other ancestors in his family had no plans to expand westward, relief washed over Xiao Yuansi. After all, he had promised Li Chejing that he would look after the Li Family.
He then spoke in a deep voice, "Li Mutian, the ancestor of the Li Family, used to be a farmer before he became a rogue cultivator, eventually attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm. He must be a remarkable individual, and his offspring are likely no less remarkable. Li Tongya, while not exceptionally talented, possesses a good heart. Li Chejing must have inherited his father's talent in swordsmanship... But I have never heard much about Li Mutian. He didn't seem to be famous in the Yue State."
Xiao Chuchou was listening intently to him but suddenly frowned and asked, "Do all four of Li Mutian's sons have a spiritual orifice?"
Unaware of the intent behind the old man's question, Xiao Yuansi pondered for a moment before replying, "The eldest son passed away when he was very young, but the remaining three sons all have spiritual orifices."
Xiao Chuchou raised an eyebrow, the wrinkles on his aged face gathering as he continued, "Oh? And what about their Xuan generation?"
After a moment's recollection, Xiao Yuansi replied slowly, his voice thick with uncertainty.
"There are three boys and one girl… All three sons possess spiritual orifices."
Xiao Chuchou picked up the tail of a spirit beast and flipped its carcass over before storing it in his storage pouch.
"The Yuan generation comes after the Xuan generation, right?"
Xiao Yuansi nodded and replied, "Yes, but I don't know much about those in the Yuan generation… There are more of them. I only know that three of them possess a spiritual orifice."
Xiao Chuchou nodded, feeling a bit reassured. He waved his hand solemnly and commented, "Li Mutian is undoubtedly remarkable. I would not be surprised if he had consumed some extraordinary heavenly treasures at some point. The bloodline of the Li Family doesn't seem like that of an ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator… it's more akin to that of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator!"
"Oh?!"
Xiao Yuansi was taken aback by this perspective, impressed by the depth of knowledge his old ancestor possessed.
During the decline of the Xiao Family, Xiao Chuchou was only a peak Qi cultivator. He left all the family's treasures and the Essence Gathering Pills to Xiao Chuting and ventured out on his own to seek opportunities. Because of this, he had gained extensive knowledge.
Xiao Yuansi recalled the demeanors of both Li Tongya and Li Xiangping, then nodded thoughtfully and replied, "Indeed… that could be the case."
As the two soared through the sky toward the Li Residence, Xiao Chuchou suddenly smiled and whispered, "I have an idea. Since the Li Family's lineage is exceptional, the Xiao Family could consider marriage with them. This would not only solidify the relationship between our families but also potentially produce a prodigious talent! If the Li Family can unify Moongaze Lake, our family could not only use them as a barrier but also form an alliance with them. After all, we're dependent on each other."
Xiao Yuansi nodded, smiling warmly as he responded, "Old Ancestor, the union you're suggesting is akin to that of the Ning and Chi families within the Azure Pond Sect. They complemented each other and monopolized the Azure Pond..."
"Our families don't need to be that close," Xiao Chuchou interjected, shaking his head. "It's good for the families to get along with each other. However, a union too close risks mutual usurpation. A mutually beneficial relationship, bound by the master-disciple ties, is adequate."
"I understand," Xiao Yuansi affirmed.
As they conversed, Mount Lijing appeared on the horizon. The foot of the mountain was lively, and the morning sunlight cast a gentle glow upon the majestic golden formation, creating a scene akin to that of a fairyland.
Li Tongya examined the jade boxes on the desk carefully, inspecting each one carefully before stacking them up, shaking his head with a tinge of regret.
"These spirit items from Mount Yue are potent even for those in the Qi Cultivation Realm. However, without the proper elixir or pill formula, ingesting them directly not only diminishes their effectiveness but also poses harm, making future breakthroughs increasingly challenging."
Spirit items, while effective, also carried impurities that could cause adverse effects. Pill crafting involved the careful refinement of these substances to minimize their adverse impacts and maximize their efficacy.
Passing the jade boxes to Li Xuanxuan, Li Tongya suddenly recalled something and asked, "Is Qiuyang still struggling to make a breakthrough?"
Li Xuanxuan nodded, equally as perplexed.
"I've spoken with Qiuyang, and indeed… he's still struggling. It's puzzling! Considering Qiuyang's talent compared to Donghe's back then, he shouldn't be in such a state…"
After thinking for a while, Li Tongya finally recalled a distant memory. Realization dawned upon him as he asked, "Do you remember the Snake Dragon Tree at home?"
"Of course," Li Xuanxuan replied as he nodded slowly. The Snake Dragon Tree could be considered the Li Family's most prized possession after the mirror and the Qingche Sword.
It bore a Snake Dragon Fruit once every five years, which Xiao Yuansi would then refine into pills. Many in the family relied on these Snake Dragon Pills to achieve breakthroughs in their cultivation.
Li Tongya shook his head, recounting an old tale in a warm tone, "Back then, we were able to discover this precious tree all thanks to Qiuyang… The child seemed blessed. He ventured into the mountains and accidentally consumed a Snake Dragon Fruit when he was young. Luckily, the fruit's mild nature only rendered him unconscious for several days. Afterward, the speed of his cultivation was extraordinary. Within just a year, he had managed to condense the Profound Scenery Chakra."
Li Xuanxuan listened intently to the story.
Li Tongya sighed, continuing, "At the time, we all thought it was Qiuyang's good fortune. Little did we know that fortune and misfortune walk hand in hand. His rapid cultivation, fueled by reckless ingestion of the spirit fruit without proper cultivation, left him with underlying issues… Now, he struggles to advance beyond the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."
Realization dawned upon Li Xuanxuan as he nodded. Li Tongya picked up the tea bowl from the table and continued, "Among all the mountains under our family's control, the spiritual qi of the spirit spring on Mount Huaqian flows the thickest. Explain to Qiuyang about his situation, then send him to Mountain Huaqian to cultivate."
"Understood," Li Xuanxuan replied respectfully. As he raised his head, an abrupt buzz emanated from the grand formation, and an elderly voice came through.
"Xiao Chuchou from the Xiao Family has come to visit… Please open the formation, Tongya, my friend."
Li Tongya quickly opened the formation and soared into the sky. Xiao Chuchou and Xiao Yuansi landed atop the mountain with a smile on their faces.
"Greetings, Seniors!" Li Tongya greeted respectfully as he cupped his fist.
"As courteous as ever, Tongya…" Xiao Chuchou remarked with a smile as he followed Li Tongya into the courtyard.
Seated alongside Xiao Yuansi, he accepted the tea that was offered to him. They exchanged a few pleasantries before shifting the conversation to the purpose of his visit.
"Your house's grand formation is ingeniously crafted. I've traversed north and south and have some knowledge of formations… This one is particularly notable," Xiao Chuchou remarked.
"It was set up by Master Liu Changdie," Li Tongya replied, causing Xiao Yuansi to raise his eyebrow at the mention of the name.
"I've seen this Liu Changdie before," Xiao Yuansi chimed in warmly, "He's quite an interesting person… Very skillful in formations and speaks as if he's been around for nearly a century. He seems to know many people."
Xiao Chuchou seemed uninterested in this topic and redirected the discussion. He scrutinized Li Tongya briefly before asking, "How confident are you in building your Dao foundation, Tongya?"
"I haven't completed my Qi Cultivation yet, so I'm uncertain," Li Tongya responded respectfully.
Xiao Chuchou nodded, sharing some crucial insights on laying the Dao foundation. Li Tongya, who had largely relied on himself throughout his cultivation journey, was naturally thrilled to receive such valuable guidance. He absorbed the advice diligently, carefully noting down every wisdom Xiao Chuchou imparted to him mentally.
Xiao Yuansi listened and interjected occasionally, adding his insights.
After receiving their guidance, Li Tongya quickly expressed his gratitude.
Xiao Chuchou smiled and waved his hand, his gaze intense and piercing as he addressed Li Tongya directly.
"Tongya, I'm sure you're also quite informed about my family's affairs!"
