"The Daoist Master has painstakingly guided you; you must reflect on this carefully." Li Xuanfeng offered some advice.
Ning Heyuan nodded in response, his expression complicated, and said softly, "I understand. I do not resent the Daoist Master for reprimanding me, nor do I fear offending any so-called Fated One. What I truly fear is the day the Daoist Master no longer bothers to chastise me, truly leaving me here without a word or care. That would be the point of no return."
Li Xuanfeng paused. Ning Heyuan retrieved a jade bottle from his sleeve and said in a quiet voice, "The matter brother-in-law entrusted to me... it has been completed. The ten Enduring Tranquility Spirit Pills have been exchanged for eight Profound Tempering Pills of even higher quality. They are all pure and uncontaminated."
Li Xuanfeng gave a slight nod and accepted the bottle. Ning Heyuan cupped his fist in salute and withdrew.
Li Xuanfeng said nothing more as he watched Ning Heyuan retreat in silence. Only then did he turn around, mounting the wind to fly back to his own cave dwelling.
Among the cave dwellings in the marketplace, a few were particularly rich in spiritual qi, with spirit springs gushing forth. Renting one of these caves usually cost over ten spirit stones per year. One of them had long been vacated for Li Xuanfeng's cultivation, while Li Qinghong was arranged in an adjacent cave of slightly lower quality.
Yet even this second-tier cave dwelling was far richer in spiritual energy than Mount Qingdu. Treasuring the opportunity, Li Qinghong dove wholeheartedly into her cultivation and only came up to pay her respects when Li Xuanfeng returned.
Li Xuanfeng took out a Harmonic Noonstone, several heavy pieces of Ocean Resonance Mercury, and a piece of emerald-blue Threadlink Jade, handing them all to Li Qinghong. He instructed, "I have no use for these; you may take them back home."
Li Qinghong nodded in acknowledgment. Li Xuanfeng then retrieved a jade bottle from his sleeve and asked softly, "The Yuwa Stone Liquid I gave you earlier—do not save it. Take it whenever you have the chance. This is the Profound Tempering Pill; consume both of these treasures, and you should be able to break through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm."
The Li Family had rarely used top-grade elixirs for breakthroughs and cultivation, relying mostly on talisman pills. Now, with both items being genuine treasures of an immortal sect's direct line, Li Qinghong carefully accepted them and replied, "Thank you, Second Uncle."
Li Xuanfeng was about to say more when someone approached from below. The man was broad-foreheaded and thick-browed—the eldest of the Ning Family—who respectfully reported, "A black-robed cultivator has arrived in the marketplace, claiming to be Li Yuanjiao, and has come to pay his respects."
"Bring him here quickly!" Both individuals showed signs of delight as Li Xuanfeng waved his hand in response.
Ning Dingbo quickly departed, and before long, a man appeared at the lower steps. His eyes were a dull gray-black, his expression slightly sullen, with closely spaced brows that hinted at a touch of cunning. Dressed in a neat black robe, his appearance was efficient and crisp.
Pausing briefly at the entrance of the cave dwelling, he first pushed open the stone door and extended his spiritual senses inward. Only after confirming the presence of the two within did his expression relax, and he stepped in with visible joy.
"Yuanjiao greets Second Uncle!" Compared to his sister's demeanor upon meeting Li Xuanfeng, Li Yuanjiao appeared much more restrained, though the joy in his eyes was undeniable.
Li Xuanfeng smiled and nodded slightly, scrutinizing him before saying, "Mid-stage Foundation Establishment Realm—good!"
Li Yuanjiao bowed deeply. Li Xuanfeng's eyes glimmered as his spiritual vision activated, revealing a variety of luminous details. Though he cultivated the same Spirit Eye Perception, his technique had been refined through the use of numerous spirit waters. After a closer look, he remarked softly, "Unfortunately, your cultivation method is somewhat crude; the clarity of your light is lacking."
Li Yuanjiao, having just broken through, had rushed over in haste. His foundation was not yet stable, and this flaw was easily noticed by Li Xuanfeng. Acknowledging this, Li Yuanjiao nodded. His family's River One Qi Technique was indeed lacking in quality.
Li Xuanfeng continued, "Qinghong's technique is ancient. While its alterations result in a slight scarcity of mana, its wonders are in no way inferior to a Grade Four or Five technique. Does the family have any high-grade techniques available in recent years?"
Li Yuanjiao nodded and recounted recent developments. After a brief pause, Li Xuanfeng finally mentioned Yu Muxian, speaking in a low tone, "I have a chance to enter the Green Pine Temple. Yu Muxian will also be entering. My family's chance to obtain treasures from him rests on this single opportunity. Daoist Master Yuan Su has already agreed that once the matter of the Green Pine Temple is concluded, we will act on the lake as well."
After laying out his reasoning, Li Xuanfeng added in a quiet voice, "With my current strength, defeating him would be easy. However, he undoubtedly possesses life-saving artifacts, making it difficult to kill him outright."
Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment, then untied a green-and-white treasure sword with a blue tassel from his waist. Holding it with both hands, he said softly, "The Qingche Sword can slay Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Please take it with you, Second Uncle."
Li Xuanfeng did not accept it but instead glanced at the sharp blade before replying, "The Green Pine Temple is hidden within the Great Void. Once the portal to this grotto heaven opens, we can examine it closely with artifacts. Perhaps we will find a way to enter."
Li Yuanjiao froze briefly, his heart stirred by this revelation, The Immortal Mirror can pierce through heaven and earth, even warding off formation barriers... Perhaps it truly could work. The family might even secure an additional spot! Moreover, that Sun Seeker Ring is an artifact of Green Pine Temple's Daoist Lu. It could resonate with the Immortal Mirror—perhaps the temple and the mirror are closely linked!
After careful deliberation, Li Yuanjiao nodded toward Li Xuanfeng and said, "Yuanjiao understands. It is worth a try."
Li Xuanfeng nodded, instructing Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong to divide the pills and spirit liquid among themselves. He gave the following orders, "The spiritual energy here is dense. While I am guarding this place, take the opportunity to cultivate and break through. Wait for the right moment. Zhong Qian is only at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm and is preparing to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. This indicates that there is still some time before the Green Pine Temple opens. Qinghong can aim to advance to the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm."
The siblings, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong, exchanged a glance before voicing their agreement and obeying the order. Li Qinghong took the pills and entered a secluded chamber to cultivate.
Converging Sea.
The heavens and earth were shrouded in gloom. Sparse raindrops fell onto the sea's surface, where a few droplets of mercury-like liquid floated, suspended between sky and sea. Slowly, as the force sustaining them dissipated, they rolled down and vanished into the briny waters.
The spiritual energy of heaven and earth rippled as the Great Void slowly parted. A cultivator in green robes emerged, stepping into the wind and waves as he walked through the air. A faint golden jade seal at his waist swayed precariously as he stood with one hand resting on the hilt of his sword, halting above the pale brown waters.
Before him, the Great Void shimmered and shifted, and a woman dressed in violet robes stepped forth. A brilliant streak of purple-gold light gleamed at the center of her brows. Her gaze swept across the green-robed man before her as she spoke softly, "So it is Daoist Master Yuan Su. I wondered what this was about… so it is your people handling this demon."
She raised her hand to reveal a pale, translucent object. It was crystalline and coiled like a length of rope, as thick as a woman's wrist and stretching for what seemed like several dozen zhang. Shimmering with white light, she said clearly, "Dongfang Ai is already dead. This dragon tendon belongs to you and now serves as repayment."
The violet-robed woman waved her arm, tossing the item into the air. Yuan Su flicked his sleeve, and the object vanished into its folds without a word. She paused for a moment before continuing, "Where did you get that golden bow? He seems quite formidable..."
Yuan Su waved his hand dismissively, answering nonchalantly, "He is my Ning family's son-in-law."
"Oh, so it is a honey trap. I did not expect you to resort to such tricks." The violet-robed woman's lips curved in faint acknowledgment as she prepared to part the Great Void and leave.
