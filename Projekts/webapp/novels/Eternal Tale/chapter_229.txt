"Brother Xun, Brother Ox, something big has happened!!!" A sharp scream echoed in their minds as Little Red came running in a panic, his pupils wide with fear. "Run! There's something wrong with this temple!"
"What’s wrong, Little Red?"
"Moo?"
"Little brother just discovered that there's a human at the early Nascent Soul stage inside the temple, and he's wearing a mask!" Little Red started rambling in an exaggerated manner, "And they’re calling a mid-Golden Core stage cultivator their young master?!"
"Hmm, but this has nothing to do with us. No need to get involved." Chen Xun burst out laughing and patted Little Red on the head. "Well done, Little Red."
"Moo~" The big black ox chuckled along and put its hoof on Little Red's back. What a clever little one.
"Brother Xun, Brother Ox, shouldn’t we be running by now?!" Little Red anxiously shouted, watching as the two older brothers continued writing in their notebooks. "This obviously involves a major human power! Sooner or later, it’s going to affect us too!"
"We'll be leaving in a few days. For now, we have some doubts to resolve."
"Moo~"
"Haha, Brother Xun, Brother Ox, I’m telling you, if we're talking safety, the safest place is the Tian Duan Pl—"
"Screw it, Old Ox, flatten him!"
"Moo!!"
"Ah! Ah~~! Ah!!!"
Little Red let out a heart-wrenching scream as he was once again ruthlessly beaten, rolling around on the ground. He tried to forcefully cough up some blood to play pitiful, but Chen Xun saw through his act and stopped him.
Three days later, in the early morning.
Inside the Chan Yin Temple, the monk was sitting cross-legged on a meditation cushion in the main hall, not chanting or reciting scriptures. At that moment, the temple doors were wide open, revealing his tall, upright figure from behind.
The entire hall was empty, except for rows of candles.
Chen Xun entered the hall with the big black ox and Little Red.
"Monk."
"Ah, the three benefactors." The monk rose and greeted them with a peaceful expression, showing no sign of feeling disturbed.
"Monk, I still have some lingering questions."
"Please sit on the meditation cushion, benefactor." The monk extended his hand. "It seems you’re ready to speak your true mind."
Chen Xun clasped his hands in respect and sat down on the cushion, crossing his legs. "As expected of a monk."
The big black ox glanced at the small cushion on the ground, knowing it couldn’t sit on it, and instead squatted down beside Chen Xun.
Little Red, eager to join in, quickly hid behind the big black ox.
"Go ahead, benefactor."
"Monk, can karma be carried into reincarnation?"
"Moo!!" The big black ox's eyes widened, even more excited than Chen Xun.
This was the true reason they had come to the Great Li Buddhist temple. Without getting an answer, they felt something was missing.
But Little Red stared blankly, confused. What did reincarnation have to do with this?
The monk was momentarily stunned and looked at them with deep, hopeful eyes before slowly speaking, "I do not tread that path, so I dare not speak on it."
At that, Chen Xun and the big black ox seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. If no one could say for sure, then they would just trust their own instincts.
"Monk, to be honest, the old ox and I have great faith in the Buddha." Chen Xun laughed and pulled out a notebook filled with names and images of various Buddhas. "Three days ago, Fan Wang told us some of your thoughts, and we..."
"Are the benefactors confused?"
"Yes."
"Moo~"
Chen Xun and the big black ox nodded and began chatting casually with the monk.
"Where do you believe the Buddha resides?" the monk asked, sitting across from Chen Xun, neither too close nor too far.
"The Buddha resides within our hearts." Chen Xun glanced at the big black ox. "Though we are cultivators, we still hold faith in the heavens, gods, and Buddhas."
"Moo!" The big black ox nodded vigorously.
Little Red twitched his mouth, thinking, "As expected of Brother Xun and Brother Ox—what a perfect blend of cultivation and faith."
The monk’s expression shifted slightly, and for the first time, he smiled. "You are indeed a remarkable person, benefactor."
Chen Xun said nothing, thinking that in the pursuit of eternal life and cultivation, having a bit of faith did no harm. It gave peace of mind, and there were no taboos involved.
"But I believe the Buddha does not reside in the heart, nor the temple." The monk put his hands together and shook his head. "The Buddha resides in the world itself. A Buddhist cultivator must step out of the temple, comprehend the world, and find the true Buddha within."
"The Buddhist cultivation grounds of the Ten Provinces of Great Li have confined all Buddhists within them. Their path of contention is meaningless. The statues in the temples are merely vessels for incense offerings, nothing more."
"Then what about the wisdom in these scriptures?" Chen Xun took out several scriptures from his storage ring, all gifts from others. "Monk, though I lack the aptitude, these scriptures truly contain profound wisdom."
"Benefactor, these sacred scriptures are meant for others to see." The monk kept shaking his head, smiling gently. "As for cultivating the Dao... they are of no use."
What the hell?!
Moo?!
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged glances, their beliefs once again being overturned. Damn, had they been placing their faith in nothing?!
"You are too attached to forms, benefactors. As cultivators, you don’t need to have faith in gods or Buddhas, for they do not exist. Too much attachment will only lock your heart in chains." The monk spoke with deep meaning, lowering his head slightly. "Everything in the world is empty. Only by embracing this emptiness can one encompass all things. Seeking too hard may hinder your path to becoming a god."
As the monk finished speaking, Chen Xun and the big black ox’s expressions grew cold.
Whoosh!
Whoosh!
In an instant, the air in the hall became thick with an overwhelming sense of terror. Little Red was so horrified that his fur stood on end, his entire body going limp.
At that moment, a beam of sunlight streamed through the corner of the hall’s window, bringing a breath of fresh air to the scene.
The monk remained unmoved, hands clasped, head slightly bowed.
"Monk, you have two Golden Cores within, yet you’ve not broken through. It seems you, too, are plagued by attachments, attachments far deeper than we imagined."
"Your insight is sharp, benefactor, and your observation is accurate." The monk did not deny it. His gaze remained tranquil, without any hint of surprise at being seen through. "The Buddhist sects of the Ten Provinces of Great Li are but one factor."
Chen Xun narrowed his eyes slightly and clasped his hands. "Monk, if the Buddha does not exist, the gods do not exist, and the heavenly Dao is not revealed, should we cultivators still hold a sense of reverence?"
"Moo?" The big black ox snorted, staring at the monk with wide eyes.
"You need not rely on external things, benefactor. Rely on your own heart. The path of immortality is long, and your heart will provide the answers."
"The monk speaks great wisdom." Chen Xun’s eyes lit up as he exhaled deeply. "Old Ox, did you catch that?"
The big black ox hesitated for a moment before nodding slightly. From now on, there would be no more worshipping gods or Buddhas or offering spirit stones.
Karma is cultivated by oneself. There’s no need to entrust one’s heart to the void. Truly staying true to oneself and maintaining reverence for all things would suffice.
It felt as though two millennia of attachment had been broken in an instant. Both Chen Xun and the big black ox felt much lighter, having gained new insight.
"You two benefactors are wise beyond measure. I pale in comparison. The monk could clearly see the change in their demeanor and was pleased. As for reincarnation, good deeds lead to good results. You need not worry."
"Thank you, monk, for your guidance!"
"Moo moo!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood up and bowed deeply, filled with respect and excitement. This journey had not been in vain!
The monk rose and returned the bow, his expression calm and composed throughout.
He then spoke up, "It seems the three of you have found your answers here. May I ask where your next destination will be?"
"Haha, monk, you see through everything. Nothing escapes your eyes." Chen Xun laughed heartily, feeling much more carefree. "We’re heading to the ocean, not for anything serious, just to fish!"
"Moo moo~~~" The big black ox grinned as well.
Little Red's eyes suddenly lit up with longing. The ocean wasn’t on land, so maybe no humans would chase him there.
"I see." The monk smiled warmly. "The three of you live freely and unrestrained, roaming the world. That is the true essence of cultivation."
Their faces turned awkward at the praise. They really hadn't thought that deeply; they were just going to have fun.
Little Red excitedly rubbed his hands together, feeling shy after being complimented by an outsider for the first time.
"Benefactors, I have a humble request."
"Monk, you are too polite. Please, go ahead."
"If the three of you happen to cross the Heavenly Gate on the sea and pass over the Milky Way, should you meet a man named Baili Zhonghu, please tell him that this humble monk failed to keep his promise."
The monk bowed deeply, his tone filled with sorrow and regret. "If you do not cross the Heavenly Gate, then please forget this conversation ever happened."
"Alright." Chen Xun stepped forward and respectfully helped the monk to his feet.
"Moo!" The big black ox's eyes bulged, remembering the name.
But inwardly, Little Red scoffed. Crossing the Heavenly Gate and the Milky Way? That sounded like a terribly dangerous place. Brother Xun and Brother Ox would never take him there to risk their lives!
