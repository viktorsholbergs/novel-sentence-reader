"Chen Xun Senior Brother!"
"Chen Xun Senior Brother!"
Two voices came from behind, one male and one female. Chen Xun had a smile on his face as he turned around. "Liuyuan, Shijing."
Shijing had a head of sleek black hair, slanting, handsome sword-like eyebrows, and a graceful and charming appearance. He was dressed in the white robe of an inner disciple, giving him the look of an aristocratic young master.
His face lit up with joy. It really was Chen Xun Senior Brother. Among all the disciples in the sect, only he had a giant black ox.
Liuyuan had a sweet and charming smile and had grown into a confident and graceful young woman. However, due to her years in the sect, she still carried a bit of a young girl's demeanor.
"Chen Xun Senior Brother, why have you come to the Alchemy Pavilion?" Shijing asked with a smile. He was quite fond of Chen Xun Senior Brother. Every time he went to check the medicinal herbs, Chen Xun's words always felt like a refreshing breeze.
Liuyuan was staring at Chen Xun, her clear and bright eyes wide open. She couldn't help but notice that Chen Xun Senior Brother seemed a bit different now. His appearance didn't show any signs of aging.
"You two are already inner disciples. I should be calling you Senior Brother and Senior Sister," Chen Xun chuckled and looked at the two.
"No, no," Shijing shook his head vigorously. "Chen Xun Senior Brother, is there something important for you to come to the Alchemy Pavilion? We can guide you."
Liuyuan's figure quivered, and she secretly probed Chen Xun's cultivation level. Surprisingly, she couldn't detect it!
She covered her mouth tightly and jumped up in excitement. "Chen Xun Senior Brother, you... you've had a breakthrough!"
"Ah?!" Shijing was taken aback. He hadn't paid much attention to Chen Xun Senior Brother's cultivation level, and he wasn't as perceptive as Liuyuan. He didn't even notice that Chen Xun was still so young.
He probed with his spiritual sense and suddenly stood still like a lightning-struck tree, looking at Chen Xun in shock.
"Greetings, Senior Uncle!"
"Greetings, Senior Uncle!"
The two of them lowered their heads and greeted each other with great joy. They were also happy for Chen Xun.
"You've made a breakthrough, and I was just about to register at the Alchemy Pavilion," Chen Xun said with a calm smile, using a bit of his spiritual power to lift them up.
This scene also made him feel a bit sentimental. Originally, he had been lifted like this by Sect Master Wei.
"Then, Senior Uncle, we won't disturb you!"
"Yes, Chen Xun Senior Brother, this is a great joy!"
The two of them jumped for joy. It seemed like they were even happier about Chen Xun's breakthrough than their own. They had no ulterior motives.
"I have some insights about cultivation in the Qi Refining stage here for you," Chen Xun said with a smile as he took out two small booklets from his storage pouch. These were some of the experiences he had summarized while cultivating. Because he and the big black ox had always advanced steadily and slowly, they had been able to discover some problems.
In the cultivation world, most people were impatient and wanted to swallow all the pills at once if they had the opportunity. But they didn't have the same state of mind for slow cultivation and contemplation.
"Senior Uncle... we can't accept such a valuable gift. We don't deserve it," Liuyuan was taken aback and took a step back, the first to decline.
"Chen Xun Senior Brother, you have given us a gift that only direct disciples should receive. We really can't accept it, so please take it back," Shijing said solemnly.
Although they knew that Chen Xun wasn't wealthy and that his talent in cultivation was not as good as theirs, they didn't underestimate this experience.
"Moo Moo~~‚Äù The big black ox suddenly disagreed. It had its own experiences, and it must accept these gifts.
"I didn't think it through; I've embarrassed you," Chen Xun shook his head and smiled bitterly. He retracted the booklets. The disciples in the Five Elements Sect were very strict with their rules, and he didn't want to cause any trouble.
"Senior Uncle, you're mistaken," the two said as they saw Chen Xun Senior Brother retrieve the booklets. They were relieved.
"Please go about your business. I'll take a leisurely stroll with the old ox and then head up the mountain. Don't let us delay you," Chen Xun said with a smile, maintaining his calm and serene demeanor.
"Yes, Senior Uncle."
"Yes, Senior Uncle."
The two bowed and left.
"Moo~"
"Let's go, old ox. I've suddenly found a nice spot."
"Moo?"
"Look at that high ground. If we stand there, we'll be able to enjoy the scenery of this flatland. Hurry!"
"Moo!"
With excitement in their eyes, they quickened their pace towards the high ground. They were so absorbed in the scenery that even the matter of registration didn't seem as important.
On the way, Liuyuan and Shijing walked side by side, heading towards their master's cave.
"Shijing, what kind of person do you think Chen Xun Senior Brother is?" Liuyuan casually asked.
"Chen Xun Senior Brother... easy-going, generous, and... yes!" Shijing contemplated for a moment and said, "Exactly."
After saying this, he nodded emphatically, and the more he thought about it, the more he felt it was true.
"I actually think Chen Xun Senior Brother is a person without much ambition. Every time I went to check the medicinal garden with the junior sisters, he was always reading a book," Liuyuan's voice was melodious, carrying a sense of ethereality.
After hearing this, Shijing was silent for a second and shook his head. "When I went with the junior brothers, Chen Xun Senior Brother was catching chickens with the black ox, saying he would cook us a delicious meal..."
"Ah? Haha..." Liuyuan laughed lightly, covering her face. "Chen Xun Senior Brother has always been an interesting person, and his character is quite straightforward."
"Yeah," Shijing sighed deeply. In the sect, the senior disciples and elders all seemed to have lived for too long and had peculiar temperaments. If you accidentally offended them, you'd have a hard time.
"What are you two whispering about so secretly?" A disheveled woman suddenly appeared behind them without making a sound.
The two were startled and horrified, standing still with cold sweat on their backs. This was not good.
"Hehe, Master, how come you're out here? My apologies for the impoliteness..." Shijing, held up by the woman, was carried away like a chick. "Liuyuan, keep up; you're not going anywhere. Are you thinking about marriage?"
"Ah?" Liuyuan blushed all over, surprised. She didn't want to be carried away like Shijing.
"Ah?! Master, please give me some face! There are so many people here!" Shijing kept on shouting, no longer having the demeanor of a young master. Being carried away in broad daylight was a disaster for his future in the Five Aggregate Sect.
"Hmph, this is the fate of the weak. Face is for the strong," The disheveled woman even slowed down her pace, raising her lotus-like jade arms higher. "When you reach the Foundation Establishment stage, I'll give you some leeway."
"Ah!!" Shijing kept screaming in desperation, determined to break through as soon as possible.
The three of them walked slowly on the road, accompanied by Shijing's pig-like screams, which were truly heartbreaking to those who heard them. Liuyuan was trembling all over, not wanting to be carried away.
In the Alchemy Pavilion, Chen Xun was surrounded by several Foundation Establishment stage elders. He repeatedly bowed and introduced himself.
"I never expected that Junior Brother Chen Xun would have such good fortune. Breaking through the realm with just one Foundation Establishment Pill is truly a blessing for our Five Elements Sect."
"In the path of cultivating, there is talk of luck. Jinghuang old man, are you implying that Junior Brother Chen Xun doesn't deserve to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage with just one pill?"
"Humph, I've never had such thoughts. Chen Xun Junior Brother don't listen to that Ran Zheng, he's talking nonsense. This guy once went crazy from alchemy..."
"Alright, you old man, how dare you slander me in front of the new junior brother? Let's spar!"
"Come on, who's afraid of who!"
The atmosphere in the hall, which had been harmonious a moment ago, suddenly became tense. Chen Xun was sweating, and it was only with the help of several surrounding elders that they were separated and calmed down.
The big black ox was also anxious, shaking its head and looking at the two. How could they draw their swords at the drop of a hat?
"Quiet." A cold-faced woman suddenly appeared on the high platform of the hall. She frowned and said it with an imposing aura, overpowering everyone in the hall.
