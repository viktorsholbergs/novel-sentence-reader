Zaratopu’s Circumstances
* * *
<<<Alright! Here I go! My proud party trick, 【Water Fish】!!!>>>
As Zaratopu declared that while wriggling its body, water spheres about the size of my head popped out one after another from the sea surface around Zaratopu.
Those water spheres float in the air and circle around Zaratopu.
But that’s not all.
“Pyururururuuuu!!”
When Zaratopu let out a shout, those water spheres, surprisingly, transformed into various shapes of fish!
Of course, they are not colored, just seawater in the same shape, but each 【Water Fish】 swimming in the air is meticulously crafted with attention to detail, from its form and fin shape to even the whiskers and scaly bumps depending on the type, which I think is quite amazing.
“Ooh……”
Clap, clap, clap.
I express my appreciation to Zaratopu through applause.
<Great Sea Serpents are a species that manipulates water using magical power, but this is particularly splendid. This level of magical power control cannot be achieved through short-term training.>
It’s also a very high evaluation from Extra-sama.
<<<Hehe! I’m glad you like it! I’ve always been small and timid, so I’m not good at hunting and was made fun of by everyone…… but I take pride in being better than anyone else in the group at carefully manipulating water!>>>
Zaratopu is also in a good mood, letting out a high-pitched “Pyururu” cry.
“Your body is…… small……?”
<<<Small for a Great Sea Serpent. My sister-in-law, for example, is about twice as long as me.>>>
How huge are Great Sea Serpents……
I gaze at the 【Water Fish】 swimming in the air, dyed red by the setting sun, and while munching on a mouthful of meat, I ponder the ecology of Great Sea Serpents and how to kill them if they become hostile.
Now, yes, it’s evening.
I’m still at the cape.
What have I been doing, you ask? For some reason, I’ve been chatting with this Great Sea Serpent Zaratopu who has become attached to me.
As you can tell from its earlier statement, this Zaratopu was indeed bullied within its group of Great Sea Serpents.
Unable to endure the painful life in the group, it ran away and came to this nearby sea about 100 years ago.
Since then, it seems to have been living leisurely in the offshore area near here.
In other words, Zaratopu and I have been talking about each other’s life stories for a long time.
Oh, what I’m eating right now is Zaratopu’s tail that was offered to me earlier.
It’s seriously delicious.
What should I do, I’m starting to see Zaratopu as nothing more than meat……
<When you’re hungry, you should just eat it. It’s quite fortunate that it’s attached to you, making it easy to hunt. Let’s attack with cutting techniques rather than blunt force.>
Even I’m not that heartless, Extra-sama……
But when I look at Zaratopu, I somehow get hungry……
I think for the sake of protecting both our minds and bodies, even though it has become attached to me, we should part ways soon.
“Hey, Zaratopu.”
<<<Yes! What is it, Anego!>>>
So, here’s the thing.
“You, go back to the offshore area immediately.”
I decided to bring up parting ways.
<<<Eeeeeh!? Why!?>>>
Zaratopu opens its big mouth, widens its eyes, and shakes its head, refusing.
But you see……
“I told you earlier, right? The nearby villagers are terrified of you. It’s inconvenient for you to be in such shallow waters too. You originally lived offshore? Then you should return there.”
Other than the option of me eating Zaratopu, I think this is the best answer.
That way, both the villagers of Panemo Village and the Great Sea Serpent Zaratopu can return to their original lives.
Endure not having dried fish.
<<<Uh, umm…… but……>>>
However, Zaratopu seems to dislike returning offshore after all.
It’s mumbling something while fidgeting and wriggling.
Getting impatient as the conversation doesn’t progress, I lightly release 【Intimidation】.
“Pyuru!?”
“Stop fidgeting. Go back.”
“Pyuru……”
I say it decisively.
Then Zaratopu…… shrank its huge body and completely drooped.
…………
The cape suddenly becomes quiet.
Only the sound of the gradually calming and shrinking waves and the sound of the wind can be heard quietly.
……Ah, geez.
“Hey, Zaratopu, you still have something you haven’t told me, right?”
“Pyuru……”
“There’s a reason you can’t go back offshore, right? Tell me.”
“Pyururu……”
As a result of shrinking its body, Zaratopu, who had lowered its face to below the cliff, stared at me with upturned eyes.
<<<Actually…… right now, my former dwelling is……>>>
It began telling me about its troubles.
<<<It’s occupied by monsters……>>>
