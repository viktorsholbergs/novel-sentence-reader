Outside Yuxu City, above the sky, four gigantic boats, each over ten zhang long, were tearing through the clouds and mist, emitting a deep rumbling sound as they sped away.
Upon closer inspection, it became clear that the two boats in the back were chasing the two boats in front.
The four giant boats streaked across the sky, their sect flags fluttering continuously: Five Elements Sect, Tianwu Sect.
In the dim sky, these boats appeared and disappeared intermittently, their defensive formations flickering with a blue glow, as if even the light carried a hint of urgency.
On one of the boats from the Tianwu Sect, a woman stood at the forefront, her eyes cold and unhurried.
Behind her, someone approached with a respectful bow:
“Peak Master, should we act now?”
“Farther away. If it's too close to the city, it will look bad.”
The woman tilted her head, her gaze fixed on the two fleeing boats in the distance, the Five Elements Sect flags stirring a sense of irritation within her.
“Yes.” The person bowed and retreated after speaking.
“Sister Xia Han.”
“Brother Fan Ping.” Xia Han elegantly turned around, her face still carrying a seductive charm, though her words were rather cold, “What is it?”
Fan Ping's eyes held a touch of softness, his half-raised black hair casting a faint gleam under the dark clouds. A flicker of infatuation passed through his eyes as he looked at Xia Han. He then bowed and said, “Sister, they’ve changed their course.”
“Doesn't matter, I knew they would before they even left the city.” Xia Han smiled charmingly, turning slightly, “Brother Xia Yuanqi will lead people to outflank them. They have no escape.”
“It seems I was overly worried.” Fan Ping’s expression briefly turned unpleasant. This Xia Yuanqi was Xia Han's cousin and his greatest rival.
“Brother, go and prepare. When Brother Xia arrives, it will be time to act.” Xia Han's gaze sharpened, the seductiveness on her face gradually transforming into killing intent, “All disciples, heed my command!”
“Peak Master!”
“Peak Master!”
On the two giant boats, everyone roared, bowing with a murderous aura, their spiritual energy constantly surging around them.
Fan Ping could only bow helplessly. How could one not be mesmerized by such a sister?
“Within that Five Elements Sect’s Refining Hall is Peak Master Ji Haoxuan. Killing these two would be a great achievement.” Xia Han's voice resounded, reaching every ear, “Do not spare your powers, for the Tianwu Sect!”
“Yes!”
“Yes!”
The disciples were ecstatic, their surrounding spiritual energy growing even more violent. To kill a Golden Core Peak Master, especially two, was a rare opportunity. Returning to the sect, even the sect master would personally congratulate them, and their status would soar.
Their killing intent grew stronger, eyes fixed on the two distant giant boats.

The vast sound of breaking through the air continued to resound. On the Five Elements Sect's boat, everyone sensed something was amiss. The disciples standing on it wore expressions of panic, cold sweat pouring out as the Tianwu Sect pursued relentlessly, showing no fear.
Liu Yuan and Ji Haoxuan stood at the stern; their brows furrowed.
“Brother Ji, among our disciples... there’s a traitor.”
“Hmm... It seems the Tianwu Sect has long premeditated this, it’s not by chance.” Ji Haoxuan’s eyes held a serious look. He glanced slightly at Liu Yuan, a flicker of doubt in his eyes.
He didn't understand why this junior sister always attended the centennial gatherings and always left last. Wasn’t this giving these thieves a chance...
“Sister Liu, it looks like this will be a fierce battle.”
Ji Haoxuan said gravely, a black cauldron roaring out, flashing with a stream of light, constantly rotating, and descending beside him. Regardless, he had to protect the sect disciples.
Moreover, this junior sister Liu had suffered too much over the years. Which peak master in the Five Elements Sect hadn’t noticed?
“Brother Ji, if we can't win, you should take the disciples and go first.” Liu Yuan took a deep breath, her eyes showing determination, “I’ll cover the back, don’t worry about me.”
As soon as the words fell, Liu Yuan formed a hand seal, unleashing streams of spiritual energy. A translucent jade umbrella appeared—a heritage treasure of the Alchemy Hall Peak Master, an upper-grade black-level artifact!
A faint pressure emanated from it, shocking the disciples on the boat. They stared at Liu Yuan in astonishment.
During the previous duels, the Peak Master had never used this treasure. Activating it had severe aftereffects, weakening one's spiritual energy for months.
“Sister Liu, you?!” Ji Haoxuan's eyes widened in horror.
“Brother Ji, I have no regrets, but these younger disciples are the hope of our Five Elements Sect.” Liu Yuan, holding the jade umbrella, showed a sorrowful yet beautiful smile. “You know my condition. After I use this artifact, take it, and lead them away, Brother Ji.”
“You...”
“Brother Ji, say no more. My mind is made up.”
Liu Yuan directly interrupted Ji Haoxuan. She slowly rose into the air, the jade umbrella emitting a dreamy glow.
Such qualities in Liu Yuan had appeared in Chen Xun's friends as well. Only such people could become his true friends.
Chen Xun and the big black ox had met many mortals and cultivators, but only a few were considered friends. They were not fools.
Ji Haoxuan's expression kept changing. Suddenly, a storage ring appeared in his hand—it was Liu Yuan's possessions.
Rage flared in his eyes as he looked at the two pursuing giant boats in the distance. What was there to fear from Xia Han and Fan Ping of the Tianwu Sect?
Ji Haoxuan spread his spiritual energy and roared:
“All disciples, heed my command!”
“Peak Master Ji!”
“Peak Master Ji!”
All the disciples bowed, their eyes filled with grief and anger, a somber atmosphere enveloping the two Five Elements Sect boats.
“Fight to the death! No retreat!”
“Yes!”
“Yes!”
Everyone's gaze grew heavy, their spiritual energy emanating from within, and their artifacts radiating with various hues, with a faint murderous aura spreading around.
Ji Haoxuan's gaze swept over the disciples’ expressions. It shouldn't be an issue here.
His eyes turned to the distance, certain that the traitor was among the disciples he had arranged to meet them...
A fierce light flashed in Ji Haoxuan's eyes. If he found out who it was, he would make sure the traitor was executed by a thousand cuts, their soul extracted and bones refined, then used as material for artifacts and placed on the road to be trampled by all disciples!
“Brother Ji...” Liu Yuan frowned. Just as she was about to speak, her expression suddenly changed, her gaze shifting sharply outward.
At that moment, a massive roar sounded from the sky on both sides of the flanks.
**Buzz**
**Buzz**
From the dim clouds on both flanks, two giant boats gradually emerged, advancing against the strong wind, bearing the flags of the Tianwu Sect!
“Friends of the Five Elements Sect, how have you been?”
A man's loud laughter echoed from the sky; his spiritual energy was so immense it was stifling. This kind of power belonged to a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator, nearing the late stage.
On the giant boat to the side, a middle-aged man stood with his hands behind his back, dressed in a blue robe, at the bow. His hair, dark as ink, was tied into a topknot. At a glance, he exuded an elegant and refined aura.
“Tianwu Sect, Xia Yuanqi!” Ji Haoxuan could hardly believe his eyes as he stepped into the air, roaring, “Are you intent on starting a sect war?!”
This person had been famous for a long time. Hundreds of years ago, he had dueled with the Heavenly Spiritual Root brother from the Five Elements Sect and had managed to escape with only a minor loss, partly due to his higher cultivation level.
For the Tianwu Sect to deploy such a figure meant they were determined to kill, leaving no chance for survival.
Indeed, back when Chen Xun was in the Five Elements Sect, the rumored Heavenly Spiritual Root was a fact kept secret for protection.
