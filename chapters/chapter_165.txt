In the eighth lunar month, the Golden Tang Gate once again advanced southward, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake as it slaughtered the people of Lixia Prefecture. Homes were razed, families perished, and the city streets were littered with bones. There was no one to mourn the dead. Desolate roads lay empty, and the air was foul with the stench of decay, bearing witness to the annihilation of countless families within the city walls.
Li Jingtian wrote all of this down in great detail, capturing the tragedy of millions in a short paragraph. Dipping her brush into the ink again, she continued writing.
The young master's wife and child were not spared from the purge. With eyes blazing with rage, he rode the wind eastward, spotting members of the Golden Tang Gate from afar, he swiftly shot one of them down.
"Auntie!"
Li Xuanling's children entered the courtyard, laughing and playing.
Li Qinghong, the elder sister, had grown tall and was now reaching Li Jingtian's waist. She had her long hair tied back and boasted an energetic personality, and now she was rushing into the courtyard.
Li Yuanyun, her younger brother, was much quieter, carefully following behind his sister. Upon seeing Li Jingtian, he greeted her respectfully while Li Qinghong had already sat by the table, eyeing her clothes.
The two children—merely six or seven years old—and not yet of age to leave the mountain, would often visit Li Jingtian, chatting with their aunt and asking for snacks. Last year, when Li Yuanjiao discovered that he had a spiritual orifice and went up the mountain, these two would wander about after school, frequently calling for their older cousin, Yuanjiao. When they finally grew tired, they would end up at Li Jingtian's place.
Li Jingtian put down her brush, closed the book on the table despite not being done with the writing, and warmly embraced Li Qinghong. Then, footsteps were heard at the door, and a gentle voice followed.
"Greetings, Auntie."
A young boy in black attire entered, his long hair tied back and a sword around his waist, his eyes bright and spirited as he looked at Li Jingtian. Remembering his mother Mu Yalu's instructions, Li Yuanjiao often visited Li Jingtian to borrow books.
"Come, have a seat." Li Jingtian smiled. Seeing the three children getting along well with each other reassured her.
She then asked Li Yuanjiao, "Where's your father?"
The mention of Li Xuanxuan caused the light in Li Yuanjiao's eyes to dim slightly.
"He's either dealing with affairs down the mountain or cultivating in seclusion… Those are the only places he goes to, where else could he be?" he responded glumly.
Li Jingtian was taken aback, quickly comforting him, "Your father has a large family to manage! Naturally, he can't always be there for you and your mother... I hope you're not upset with him."
"I wouldn't dare," Li Yuanjiao replied hastily, yet thought to himself, Mother and Auntie said the same thing but I'm not blind... Why can he spend time with Brother Xiu every day, but not with my mother and me?
Li Yuanxiu, the elder brother, was quiet and gentle, and Li Yuanjiao shared a good relationship with him. Hence, these thoughts left Yuanjiao feeling uncomfortable. He pursed his lips tightly, unwilling to let any of it out.
Li Jingtian, noticing this, was about to offer some consolation when two knocks were heard at the door.
Li Tongya dusted his robe before stepping into the room, followed by Li Xuanling in leather armor and Li Xuanxuan in a long robe.
The children in the room were startled, standing up in a flurry and greeting Li Tongya all at once.
"Second Granduncle!"
"Grandfather!"
"Hmm," Li Tongya responded with a smile. Recently, he had unexpectedly broken through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, bringing him great joy over the past few months. Seeing the children's cheerful demeanor brought a rare smile to his usually stoic face.
"Has Xuanfeng not come out of seclusion yet?" he asked.
"Not yet."
After burying his wife, Li Xuanfeng immediately went into seclusion on the mountain and was never seen wandering around since then. He had been more diligent in his cultivation than before, now having been in seclusion for over two years.
Li Tongya stroked his beard, feeling reassured by the changes in Li Xuanfeng. As an elder in the family, he looked at things from a long-term perspective.
"If it wasn't for losing a child in the prefecture, this lesson could almost be considered beneficial... It made this kid seriously reflect and focus on his cultivation."
Observing the cautious children, Li Tongya considered the timing and said to Li Xuanxuan, "It's time to get Yuanxiu up the mountain... If we delay it any further, it might hinder the child's progress."
The brothers exchanged glances, understanding Li Tongya's intent.
Li Xuanxuan nodded, and immediately, a clan guard was sent down the mountain to call for Li Yuanxiu, who was now fourteen and had been assisting with some matters at the mountain's foot.
Li Tongya sipped his tea, observing the children. His gaze lingered on Li Yuanjiao, dressed in black.
All the children are clever. Xuanling has only Yuanyun for a male heir, while Xuanxuan has many descendants... including four or five from his concubines. We could select one to be adopted by Xuanling to continue the lineage, preferably one with a spiritual orifice… Yuanjiao seems like an ideal choice.
However, this is a significant matter, and it's better to observe the child's talent and personality first.
As he mused, Li Yuanxiu had arrived at the house. He was a rather handsome youth draped in a white goose feather cloak. His smile was gentle, yet he remained quiet and polite. Clutching a green sword, he exuded a certain grace.
"Greetings, elders!" Li Yuanxiu's clear and strong voice rang out.
Seeing him, Li Yuanjiao and the other children stood up and looked at him eagerly, almost wanting to rush up and wrap him in an embrace.
Li Tongya nodded slightly while Li Xuanxuan smiled broadly, thoroughly pleased with the eldest of the fourth generation. Li Yuanxiu, be it in his demeanor, appearance, handling of matters, or talent, was considered exceptional. He was beloved by his cousins and capable of shouldering heavy responsibilities.
Everyone took their seats, and the children, standing awkwardly in the middle of the courtyard, hid behind Li Yuanxiu.
Li Xuanxuan glanced at his sibling and then warmly said to the children, "It's rare for us all to gather like this, especially with your second granduncle out of seclusion. Don't be shy, come forward."
Li Tongya glanced at the long sword hanging at Li Yuanxiu's waist and asked warmly, "How goes your sword technique cultivation? Have you mastered the Profound Water Sword Technique?"
Li Yuanxiu replied, "I started learning the sword at seven and this is my sixth year practicing it. I've memorized the Profound Water Sword Technique by heart and managed to unleash sword aura."
Li Tongya nodded and praised him.
"Well done… Come to the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche tomorrow. I'll teach you sword techniques."
Li Xuanxuan, overjoyed, knew of Li Tongya's high proficiency in swordsmanship. Learning from him would be excellent. Li Yuanxiu nodded eagerly while the other children in his generation looked on enviously.
Li Tongya smiled at the other children and explained, "The same goes for all of you. Whoever manages to unleash a sword aura before the age of fifteen may come and find me at the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche."
After saying this and nodding at Li Xuanxuan, Li Tongya left.
Li Jingtian followed to see him off, while Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan exchanged glances with each other.
Li Xuanling suggested softly, "Let's take the children to the back courtyard then, Yuanxiu, Yuanjiao, Yuanyun… and as for Qinghong…"
"She'll come too," Li Xuanxuan decided after a moment's thought.
Suddenly, the image of Li Jingtian's face popped into his mind, reminding him of the bewilderment and helplessness in her eyes when he asked if she would marry Chen Donghe years ago.
Feeling a tightness of guilt in his heart, he spoke firmly, "Take them all! If Second Uncle asks, I'll explain."
