"Kill!"
"Kill!"
"Kill!"
Thunderous battle cries erupted outside the four immortal mountains, surging like a tide, their eyes radiating boundless killing intent.
Ferocious gales churned up towering waves on the sea, where countless massive warships formed an endless fleet. All eyes focused on the farthest edge of the Hanging Sea Region.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Suddenly, the vast ocean ahead surged wildly. The first thing to come into view were countless fearless battle flags.
From the horizon, massive warships sailed forward, shadowing the skies. Endless ships emerged at the sea's edge; everywhere one looked, it was filled with allies.
The cultivators aboard were overwhelmed with excitement and awe. In the distance stood the legendary Four Immortal Mountains, bathed in radiant light, the true forbidden zone of Great Li Realm.
The scene was earth-shattering—an unparalleled spectacle that left Chen Xun and his group utterly astounded.
Speechless, they gawked at the far horizon, uttering nothing but exclamations like "Holy crap!" and "Incredible!" repeatedly.
"Moo!!"
The big black ox trembled with excitement, releasing a long bellow. The ancient sealing formation ahead was the very same one they had encountered before!
If its assumptions were correct, the four immortal mountains served as the true cores of the grand formation—a truly monumental feat that broadened its horizons.
"Brother Xun, Brother Ox... I think I'm about to pass out..." Little Red panted heavily. "With such a formation, who knows how terrifying the accursed beasts must be?"
"Ha!" Chen Xun burst into laughter, grabbing the ox's head while his gaze lingered on the grand mountains. "This trip was worth it."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox cheerfully rubbed against Chen Xun, thrilled to finally witness such a grand occasion.
Amidst the discussions among cultivators, two figures streaked across the sky, their overwhelming presence shocking everyone.
Simultaneously, four figures emerged from the immortal mountains, heading to the center. They appeared as the protagonists of the heavens, drawing everyone's respectful attention.
"Baili Wentian, Fellow Daoist Jiu Hua, it has been years!"
"Indeed, my friends, the day of the millennial blood battle has come again." Baili Wentian slightly cupped his hands, his gaze domineering. "Here stand the finest sons of our realm. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators deserve the respect of the Baili Clan."
"Indeed!"
"Well said!"
Their voices carried for thousands of miles, audible to all present. Foundation Establishment cultivators were deeply moved, involuntarily bowing to the sky in silent reverence.
Even Little Red's pupils contracted; a strange sense of peace replaced his fear.
Chen Xun and the big black ox smiled. These were genuine Nascent Soul cultivators with grand visions, willing to carry even their small ship along without disdain.
"Fellow Daoists, open the Heavenly Gate. Our realm's warriors are ready!"
"Ha! My Ancient Lineage is prepared as well!"
"Elders, open the Heavenly Gate!"
"Yes!"
"Yes!"
From the four immortal mountains came a mighty response. Each mountain unleashed towering beams of light piercing the heavens, stirring up stormy seas as waves revealed their ferocious faces, seemingly ready to devour everything.
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
The entire night lit up brilliantly, illuminating everything. The tremors seemed to shake the heavens and earth, far beyond imagination. The massive formation in the background finally began to move!
Yet from Foundation Establishment cultivators to Nascent Soul experts—except for the trembling Beigong Red Lion—not one showed fear.
All eyes widened as a purple-golden barrier radiated dazzling brilliance. It was the eruption of spiritual energy, the rise of the formation, shaking the very heavens.
Meanwhile, the sea beneath them was descending, as if the waters were being absorbed away.
The warships in mid-air had completed all preparations, and the formation began suppressing the sea, stabilizing the surroundings.
At that moment, a wave of spiritual pressure rose between heaven and earth. Countless cultivators turned pale, their spiritual energy sluggish, but the overwhelming pressure did not originate from the cultivators themselves.
It came from the majestic Four Immortal Mountains standing on the sea!
Boom! Boom!
Everywhere, cracking sounds echoed as giant ships began to sway. The red guiding lines snapped one by one, transforming into a force to suppress the sea.
"Hold steady, Old Ox, Little Red." Chen Xun's eyes were filled with excitement, overwhelmed by shock. "The Inverted Heavenly Gate is about to open."
"Moo! Moo!"
"Brother Xun... I'm fine!" Little Red clung tightly to the big black ox's back, afraid of falling. "This spiritual pressure... it's terrifying."
Chen Xun exchanged a glance with the big black ox, unfazed and even letting out strange chuckles. Spiritual pressure? This?
But they refrained from arrogance, feigning discomfort to avoid drawing attention. They supported each other, wearing expressions of intense suffering, as if they'd swallowed something foul.
Little Red watched the act in disbelief—it nearly convinced him!
The phenomenon caused by the ancient formation lasted a full hour, leaving everyone stunned and discussing in hushed tones.
In the distance, the purple-gold light barrier brimmed with vitality. Half of the sea's waters had been absorbed, the ships descended lower, and the ancient formation continued to transform.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Deafening explosions resounded across heaven and earth, shaking even the Four Immortal Mountains. The scene was awe-inspiring and mysterious.
"Look, the formation is the Heavenly River!"
"The inverted Heavenly River lives up to its name—so the gate is made of an endless river!"
"What kind of supreme cultivator could create such a formation?"
"Unbelievable!"
Exclamations echoed from all directions as cultivators craned their necks toward the sky. The vast formation, like a frozen tsunami, solidified completely, its grandeur unmatched.
"Fellow cultivators, set sail!"
"Set sail!"
"Yes!"
An authoritative command descended from the heavens. The warships began moving toward the heavenly gate, with the formation's radiance dazzling the skies.
Thunderous sounds filled the air as the inverted heavenly gate, fully activated by the Four Immortal Mountains, transformed its light barrier into a water screen. The earth-shaking sound of its opening reverberated.
Massive, inverted rivers surged toward the horizon under the formation's power, covering the skies. Towering water columns extended endlessly, shocking the world.
Whether on sea, land, or air, the warships pressed forward like moths to a flame, heading into the gate. Ahead lay darkness, its end unseen.
Though the number of ships seemed infinite, they appeared insignificant against the immense inverted heavenly gate. Yet none of the cultivators hesitated; they marched on fearlessly!
However, at the very back, Chen Xun and his group stayed back, finding a secluded spot to observe from afar. The Baili Clan didn’t interfere, as they never forced anyone to join the fight. However, those who stayed behind would no longer receive protection.
"Brother Xun... Aren’t we going to join the battle?!" Little Red glanced around. The number of warships had dwindled; traveling together clearly seemed safer.
"We’re not going. We’re just here to broaden our horizons and enjoy the view," Chen Xun replied, shaking his head. "Our paths are different. Reaching this point is enough for me."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox nodded, understanding his meaning.
They were immortals. If they joined the battle against the accursed beasts and became embroiled in conflict, it would be meaningless. They were, after all, outliers.
Immortality was never fully accepted anywhere, especially not in the face of accursed beasts. It made them too conspicuous.
