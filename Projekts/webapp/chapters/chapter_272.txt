Crackle, crackle…
A crimson fire blazed in the marketplace of Milin Prefecture, its flames dancing along the eaves, emitting the smell of burning wood. Blood flowed and dripped all over the ground and bodies lay strewn haphazardly at the street corners.
Fei Wangbai stood quietly with his hands clasped behind his back.
Among the guest cultivators he had brought, one had perished, and they had already taken care of the body. However, Fei Wangbai felt no sorrow. This assault on Milin Prefecture's marketplace had resulted in an abundance of spirit items and dharma artifacts for him, so much so that his storage pouches could not even contain them all. In fact, Fei Wangbai was so overjoyed that he almost laughed out loud. While the Li and Yu families fought, it was the Fei Family that reaped the greatest benefits.
Fei Wangbai scuffed his boots against the ground, feeling immensely proud of himself. Even the bright red blood staining the ground seemed celebratory. As he took a few steps forward, he saw a middle-aged man standing mid-air, arranging the bodies in a way to prevent them from being consumed by the fire.
"Brother Jiang," Fei Wangbai called out, seeing Jiang Heqian's somber expression.
Jiang Heqian then turned and responded slowly, "They are still relatives… Let not the fire burn them. The Yu Family will handle the burial."
Fei Wangbai remained silent. Jiang Heqian, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, took only a few breaths to handle these minor tasks. Fei Wangbai then cupped his fist after some time and said, "Brother Heqian, you have done a great service. We should share the spoils from this marketplace."
Jiang Heqian's mind was occupied with the memory of Yu Xiao'ou's final gentle pats on his wrist. The old man's hand had been scorching, making Jiang Heqian's limbs tingle and his soul feel disjointed.
He had lost interest in everything else. Perhaps the massacre had exhausted much of his accumulated hatred, for his expression no longer seemed as fierce as before.
He replied softly, "Brother Wangbai, I no longer have any desire for this. My only thought in this life was to exact revenge. You can take these items back and distribute them among your clan… I have no use for them."
"I can't possibly…"
Fei Wangbai understood the value of these items, but his shrewd mind still saw an opportunity in this situation. He hoped to recruit Jiang Heqian, now alone, as a guest elder for the Fei Family. Jiang Heqian's cultivation technique was exceptional, and his combat prowess was top-notch.
Fei Wangbai insisted on sharing the loot. Jiang Heqian, unable to refuse, cupped his fist and said, "We can discuss this another day. You can sort out the items and convert them to Spirit Stones for me, Brother."
Fei Wangbai nodded, his robe fluttering lightly in the northern wind. "Now that this matter is settled, we must leave quickly. If Yu Yufeng returns, it could ruin everything!" he replied.
Seeing Jiang Heqian nod, Fei Wangbai suddenly remembered Li Tongya, thinking to himself, Li Tongya is still holding off Yu Xiaogui… I wonder what the situation over there is like. Does he need our help?
As Fei Wangbai pondered this, a sudden sinister thought flashed in his mind, The Yu Family has suffered a great loss and will likely be in a decline for decades or even centuries. The Li Family, with Li Chejing and Li Tongya, has become too strong... It might be best to leave now and let Li Tongya suffer a setback at Mount Huazhong to balance the two families' power…
This thought took hold of him like a demon, swirling madly in Fei Wangbai's mind. His blood surged as he imagined the solemn face of Li Tongya and the heroic, radiant face of Li Qinghong.
Finally, he gritted his teeth and thought, The Yu Family still has the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator Yu Yufeng, who alone can suppress three families… In the end, I must join forces with Li Tongya. To sour relations with the Li Family over this small profit would be foolish, especially if Yu Yufeng picks us off one by one. Furthermore, the Li Family is on the southern shore, and my family is on the northern shore. With Moongaze Lake between us, we are natural geopolitical allies. Neither side will harbor ill intentions…
Fei Wangbai exhaled deeply, suppressing the sinister thought stirring within him. A suave, handsome smile returned to his face as he cupped his fist toward Jiang Heqian.
"Li Tongya is still struggling in the south… I must go to his aid. Fellow Daoist, please return to your cave dwelling. Once this is over, I will come to thank you personally."
This was no problem for Jiang Heqian as he had no desire to stay, and was feeling increasingly uneasy. Grateful for the reprieve, he cupped his fist, exchanged a few polite words, and rode the wind away swiftly. Fei Wangbai directed his guest cultivators to return home while he flew toward the Li Family's direction.
Clang!
Li Tongya dodged the Foundation Establishment Realm artifact, Jade Smoke Mountain, then drew his sword, and turned around. His expression was still terrifyingly calm.
Before him, Yu Xiaogui took a deep breath, staring at Li Tongya in disbelief, his heart in turmoil.
The Boundless Ocean is this difficult to deal with?! This is too astonishing!
For four full hours, Yu Xiaogui had relentlessly been on the offensive to Li Tongya, from the break of dawn until the sun was high in the sky. Initially, the Li Family members had looked up in fear, worrying for Li Tongya silently. Now, however, they had long returned to their tasks, ignoring the two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the sky. This infuriated Yu Xiaogui even more.
Li Tongya gently deflected the incoming Jade Smoke Mountain and, seeing Yu Xiaogui finally pause, already felt his mana recovering rapidly. His expression was unreadable as he finally smiled and asked, "Brother Xiaogui… do you wish to continue?"
Watching Yu Xiaogui's grim expression, Li Tongya silently but gleefully added in his mind, If you don't… the 40% of mana I've expended will soon be replenished.
Yu Xiaogui glared at him, looking down at the numerous Li Family members below them. He realized with sudden shock that he had been away from home for over four hours now, without any Yu Family members arriving to assist.
Panic flickered in his heart.
"Fei Wangbai... you have truly colluded with them!" Yu Xiaogui narrowed his eyes, knowing that it was likely the Fei Family who had acted. Fortunately, the Jade Court Guarding Formation was incredibly strong.
Even if Fei Wangbai had called for help from his early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm allies, they could not possibly have breached it in just four hours. Relieved, he waved his sleeve coldly and sneered.
"You have impressive skills, fellow Daoist."
Li Tongya merely cupped his fist without replying. Nearby, Wu Shaoyun had endured four hours of torment, nervously watching the two of them. At last, he saw a streak of light in the sky. A handsome, middle-aged man in elegant white robes descended, cupping his fist.
"Wangbai greets fellow Daoists!"
Li Tongya responded by cupping his fist. Fei Wangbai glanced at the situation and laughed. "I heard the Yu Family was bullying the weak, so I hurried over to assist… But it seems I have no need to worry about Brother Tongya."
Fei Wangbai's words now completely favored the Li Family, no longer showing even a facade of respect for the Yu Family. After Jiang Heqian had killed so many at the Yu Family's marketplace, there was no longer any room for reconciliation between the Fei and Yu families. Fei Wangbai no longer saw any reason to play games with them.
Yu Xiaogui's heart sank at these words, a sense of foreboding rising within him. He shouted, "Fei Wangbai! What despicable acts have you committed?!"
Feigning surprise, Fei Wangbai turned his head and replied, "Brother Xiaogui, what do you mean by that?"
