"Humans, what is the meaning of this?!"
"Humans, what is the meaning of this?!"
A voice, neither beast nor human, echoed from the depths of the Northern Region, laced with an unmistakable hint of wariness.
In the sky, Chen Xun's eyes sharpened, lightning flashed in his pupils, and he spoke:
"The war in the Northern Region is over. We've come to collect some corpses, gain merit, and perform some rituals." Chen Xun's mighty voice reverberated across the sky, "I hope you'll give us some respect."
"Moo!"
The big black ox let out a skyward bellow, its body now covered in dense fur. Under the moonlight, it shone with divine energy, flooding in all directions!
It slowly revealed a bloodthirsty smile. "You little spirit beasts better know your place. When the big brother speaks, he doesn't joke."
Some spirit beasts' pupils shrank to needlepoints. Why did they feel an overwhelming suppression deep in their bloodlines?
What kind of spirit beast is this black ox?!
"Retreat three hundred miles!"
"Retreat three hundred miles!"
The strange voice from deep within the Northern Region echoed again, filled with an inexplicable heaviness.
**Roar!**
**Roar!**
The glaciers trembled, and the spirit beasts at the front, as if prepared, retreated frantically as if they were waiting for this command!
"Thank you."
"Humans, keep your word, or there will be no end to this."
"You dare threaten me?!"
"Moo?!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox suddenly erupted in fury. The flames behind them blazed even brighter, and the power within them was far beyond mere spiritual energy.
A strange silence enveloped the scene.
The voice from deep within the region fell silent, as though something had caught its throat.
Chen Xun glanced toward the glacier's depths, filled with the faces of cultivators, lifeless, as though their consciousness had been wiped away by something.
Slowly, he pulled out a mountain-opening axe infused with both the power of the five elements and deathly energy.
**Boom!**
**Boom!**
A terrifying slash of the axe descended from the sky, splitting the glacier apart, revealing the bones of many cultivators at the bottom.
Some Nascent Soul spirit beasts deep within the Northern Region twitched nervously. When did the human race produce such a powerful figure...
A shadow with glowing blue eyes gazed at the vast chasm in the glacier, as if warning all of the Northern Region—cross this line, and you die!
Its expression was dark, suppressing an anger that threatened to explode.
The aura and pressure from those two had already surpassed its understanding—it could not risk certain death.
Half a month later. In the Northern Region, piercing suona music and the constant ringing of bells echoed across the glacier, terrifying many spirit beasts. It sounded like a soul-calling melody, as if luring them across the boundary.
At the same time, the Top Ten Sects released an astonishing message, urging all sects and cultivators to head to the Northern Region to claim their dead.
In the Northern Region. Chen Xun cradled the body of Jin Yu. Her skin was pale as snow and all traces of life within her was gone, her Nascent Soul utterly obliterated.
The big black ox carried a few bodies from the Five Element Sect, having found only a handful.
They boarded their massive flying ship and headed for the Five Element Sect and Nine Palaces Mountain.
Chen Xun and the big black ox did not disturb anyone, simply making coffins with their own hands and placing the bodies back in their sects before quietly leaving.
Jiang Xuechen watched, heart in agony, her face devoid of any emotion or smile.
She knew exactly who had returned Old Ancestor Jin Yu's body. Only those two seniors in the cultivation world could possess such power now.
Several high-ranking members of the Ten Great Sects, upon seeing the chasm carved into the glacier, immediately understood who had done it.
Zheng Yi sighed deeply, cupping his hands to the heavens, "Those two deserve the respect of every cultivator in the world."
...
A year later, at Bailing, a border city in the west of Qian Nation.
Today, the morning sun rose like a round lantern in the sky. Soon, it transformed into a blazing wheel of fire, casting golden rays upon everything, bathing the world in resplendent light.
The vast Tian Duan Plains remained desolate, with rolling yellow sands rushing in all directions, a scene of endless barren wilderness.
A massive flying ship rested far outside the city. The giant tree at the stern was tinged with golden hues, swaying in the fierce sandstorm.
Within the city, countless people emerged from their homes, staring blankly at the sight of the giant tree, towering higher than the city walls.
Children jumped and cheered, never having seen such a spectacle.
At this moment, many immortals soared across the sky, and more flying ships hurtled toward the west.
From above, one could see the cultivation sects of every state in Qian Nation, with beams of light flashing across the sky and ships speeding toward Bailing.
Not only from Qian Nation, but even from the eastern regions, many cultivators were rushing to this location.
Some wore anxious expressions, others were filled with curiosity, while some looked exaggeratedly amazed, unable to believe what they were seeing.
On the ground, even more mortals were galloping on horseback, kicking up dust, with banners flying for Ning!
On the giant flying ship outside Bailing, two figures stood.
They were busy checking everything, uncertain of how long the journey ahead would be, not daring to be careless.
"Old ox, have we brought all our old brothers?" Chen Xun shouted from the bow, "Damn it, we're really leaving, huh?!"
"Moo!!"
The big black ox scurried around frantically, checking formations and testing the five-element energy of the Tian Duan Plains.
Though the area lacked spiritual energy, the five-element power was sufficient—energy wouldn't be an issue.
"Damn it, we're really leaving! Old ox, we're leaving this cultivation world!"
Chen Xun stood at the lookout, gazing into the distance, not even sure what he was saying. "Damn it, why am I so excited..."
"Moo!!" The big black ox bellowed angrily, already overwhelmed, while Chen Xun kept distracting it.
Chen Xun's face flushed, his chest heaving. "A superpower, at the edge of the Milky Way, that legendary world... Damn!!!" he shouted into the distance. The yellow sands surged, and the road ahead remained vast and unclear.
An hour later.
"Moo~~~!!!" The big black ox howled, on the verge of bursting from excitement, rubbing against Chen Xun, pots and pans hanging from its sides.
"Damn it, Old Ox, take off!!!"
"Moo!!!"
They both roared together, their voices shaking the heavens as the yellow sands swirled wildly.
**Buzz**
**Buzz**
The massive ship began to lift off, powered by the five elements. The swirling sands were swept aside, as a brilliant sun lay low on the horizon, radiating endless light.
Chen Xun and the big black ox clung to the side of the ship, winds rushing toward them and howling in their ears.
They gazed back at Qian Nation, at the mortal realm, and at the cultivation world they had known for so long.
The once naïve boy and the big black ox from a small mountain village had now become forces to be reckoned with.
The fierce wind roared on as countless cultivators stood outside Bailing, staring blankly at the ship. What kind of flying ship was this...
"Five Element Sect, bidding farewell to the Old Ancestor!!!"
"Five Element Sect, bidding farewell to the Old Ancestor!!!"
"Five Element Sect, bidding farewell to the Old Ancestor!!!"
Suddenly, a thunderous shout filled with spiritual energy echoed across the sky. The entire Five Element Sect stood in the air, watching the ship ascend.
Liu Han, Shi Wujun, Ji Zhao were all tearful, trembling, and bowed deeply.
"Moon Tower, bidding farewell to the Senior!!!"
"Moon Tower, bidding farewell to the Senior!!!"
"Moon Tower, bidding farewell to the Senior!!!"
On another side of the sky, Jiang Xuechen smiled as she led hundreds of female disciples. They watched the rising ship with awe in their hearts.
"Farewell, Senior!"
"Farewell, Senior!"
"Farewell, Senior!"
Whether in the sky or on the ground, the resounding voices drowned everything out. Even members of the Top Ten Sects had come, all bowing toward the distant ship.
"Hahaha..."
"Moo moo moo~~!!!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox laughed, waving at everyone below. "We're off, see you if fate allows!!!"
"Chen Xun!! Don't forget, if you become famous one day, remember where you came from!!!"
Suddenly, a booming shout echoed from afar. A Nascent Soul-level master had arrived—Zheng Yi, pulling at his beard. "Safe travels!!"
"You bet!!"
Chen Xun shouted back, his voice shaking the heavens and stirring hearts.
The big black ox snorted with excitement, staring deeply at the faces of everyone below, unsure when they might return.
The world was vast, and their spirits remained as boundless as ever.
**Buzz!**
**Buzz!**
The massive ship completed its ascent, disappearing into the clouds. The distant figures grew smaller and smaller, and everyone watched the ship with hopeful gazes.
Chen Xun and the big black ox's laughter echoed across the skies.
**Boom!!**
Suddenly, a large hole opened in the distant clouds. as the ship, powered by the five elements, embarked on its journey into the unknown!!!
