Farewells and Each One’s Departure
* * *
“Now then.”
<<<It’s finally time……>>>
Emi and Zaratopu, gazing into each other’s eyes, gave a small nod.
Right now, Emi and Zaratopu are in a nameless inlet.
This inlet, located a little north of the cape near Panemo Village, is a location where a beautiful sandy beach is surrounded by cliffs.
Being in a remote place and moreover only accessible by crossing the sea, Emi and Zaratopu had been spending about a week monopolizing this place for these reasons.
Eating the remaining shrimp and squid meat, playing, diving in the sea to hunt, playing, accompanying Zaratopu’s training, playing, and doing various things……
<<<Uuu…… even though it’s only been a short time since I met Anego…… just thinking that we won’t be able to see each other for a while makes me feel really lonely……>>>
“Yeah.”
I give my usual deliberately emotionless response to Zaratopu, who is feeling lonely.
……Yes, today is the day we part ways.
I will walk on land, and Zaratopu will swim in the sea.
From today, we will each walk separate paths again.
“Don’t be a crybaby. If you say you want to stay together any longer, I’ll kill and eat you.”
<<<H-Hieee…… haha, I guess this is the last time I’ll hear Anego’s jokes……>>>
……It’s not really a joke.
Recently, I find myself wanting to eat Zaratopu quite a bit.
It’s one of the reasons we should part ways.
But…… that’s not the only reason.
“Pull yourself together…… you’re going back to your group, right?”
<<<……Yes!>>>
With that response, the flames of fighting spirit lit up in Zaratopu’s eyes.
That’s right, Zaratopu has decided to return to the group of Great Sea Serpents called the Zii Clan that he once ran away from.
Zaratopu had been saying that he ran away from the group because he was bullied…… but the reality seems to have been close to being expelled.
The kind and wise elderly Great Sea Serpent clan leader who had been good to Zaratopu until then passed away, and a violent Great Sea Serpent took the position of clan leader…… Zaratopu, who had displeased the new clan leader, barely escaped with his life after being half-killed by the men of the group…… this is what actually happened when Zaratopu left the group.
<<<It might be too late now, and they might hate me…… but I got a bit curious about what my sister-in-law and childhood friend are doing now.>>>
By the way, I heard this childhood friend was the “clan leader’s daughter,” but that clan leader is the elderly one who was kind to Zaratopu.
In other words, under the violent new clan leader, there is a possibility that she is in a delicate position, and Zaratopu can’t help but be concerned about her.
Also, although it’s been nearly 100 years since Zaratopu ran away from the group, Great Sea Serpents have a very relaxed sense of time, so that much isn’t treated as a big deal from the past.
“Zaratopu.”
Now, I’m an Anego.
Even though my body is small and I’m young, I’m still an Anego.
Before we part, I want to tell my underling.
I speak to him while gazing into those sparkling eyes.
“Don’t do anything reckless.”
<<<Yes…… haha, you’re the one to talk, Anego.>>>
“If you can run away, I think it’s good to run away.”
<<<Yes…… me too.>>>
“……But you’re going to face it, right?”
<<<……Yes. After meeting Anego and fighting together…… I seriously thought I can’t stay like this. I don’t want to remain a coward. So, so……>>>
“If you’ve decided that, I’ll support you.”
<<<Yes!>>>
“Do your best!”
<<<Yes!!>>>
“Move forward!”
<<<Yes!!!>>>
“If anyone gets in your way…… kill them all!!”
<<<Yes…… wait, that’s too violent!!!>>>
Zaratopu wriggled and let out a frightened “pyuru pyuru” cry.
Yeah, that’s the usual Zaratopu.
It’s not good to get too fired up either.
I think this is just right!
<<<Ah, that’s right! Before we part…… there’s something I want to give to Anego who’s taken care of me!>>>
Now, Zaratopu, who had been wriggling, seemed to remember something here.
“Something you want to give?”
<<<Yes! It’s a present from me!>>>
Saying that, Zaratopu brought its face close to me and started straining……
<<<Hnn!>>>
From its nostrils, it blew out a fist-sized white ball with a plop!
“Is that a booger?”
<<<No, it’s not!>>>
At my remark, Zaratopu angrily let out a “pyuru pyuru.”
No, but you know, when a white object suddenly flies out of the nose, it can only look like a booger……
Do Great Sea Serpents stuff small objects they find into their noses to carry them……?
<<<I found that in the sea when I was retrieving the giant shrimp and squid! It’s sparkling and pretty, right? I heard before that humans like sparkly things like this! So I’m giving this to Anego as a present!>>>
Saying that, Zaratopu’s eyes sparkled.
Ugh, when you look at me with those eyes, it’s hard to say I don’t want it……
<Ah!? This is a Divine Jewel!?>
And here.
Extra-sama, who had been silent to read the mood, suddenly let out a surprised voice!
A Divine Jewel?
<Yes! To put it simply…… it’s a gem that gods use to store excess power. The stored power is used like money in transactions between gods. Sometimes it’s bestowed upon believers in the lower world, so this is probably one of the Divine Jewels that was brought to earth through such circumstances.>
Storing excess power…… a god’s excess power…… isn’t that potentially quite dangerous?
<That’s right. However, this Divine Jewel seems to have lost its power long ago. Now it’s just an extremely hard gem. I don’t think even the current Emi can break it.>
Eh, really?
When you say that, I want to try it.
I put all my strength into both hands and try to crush it.
But…… it’s indeed hard.
Not even a crack.
<<<Hey, Anego! You’ll accept it, right!>>>
“……Alright.”
Well, anyway.
It’s something my underling went out of his way to pick up for me.
There’s no harm in accepting it.
I thoroughly washed the Divine Jewel with seawater, drained the water, and put it in my pants pocket.
……Only that part is bulging strangely, making it look awkward and unsettling.
I should prepare a bag next time.
* * *
“……It’s about time to go.”
After chatting idly for a while longer, the time to part finally came.
I kick a stone rolling on the sandy beach and jump onto Zaratopu’s head with a hop.
<<<Understood!…… But is it okay? Are we really doing it?>>>
Zaratopu heads offshore while carrying me and sends a worried 【Telepathy】.
“It’s fine, just do it.”
“Pyuru!”
If I order it without giving any choice, Zaratopu doesn’t say anything else.
It lets out a short cry and advances into the open sea with a splash.
And a few minutes later.
The beautiful vast ocean that stretches on forever.
The deep blue sky.
And the towering, pure white cumulonimbus clouds.
With such a common summer scenery at our backs, Emi and Zaratopu were gazing at the land.
<<<North, north, north, so…… it’s this way!>>>
Zaratopu checks the direction of the sun and turns its body to the north.
<<<Well then…… Anego, this is where we part! I hope…… we can meet again!>>>
“Me too.”
<<<The preparations are perfect! Anytime you’re ready!>>>
“Understood.”
At Zaratopu’s voice as a signal, I jumped off Zaratopu’s head towards the sea with a hop.
Zaratopu gulps me into its mouth.
At the same time, I deploy 【Black Arms】.
Covering my body in a sphere.
<<<Well then…… here I gooo!>>>
There’s a sound of splashing and gulping.
Zaratopu took in more seawater along with me into its mouth.
<<<【Emi Cannon】…… fire!!!>>>
DONN!!
A loud impact sound!
At the same time, I feel an intense gravity pulling me back.
That’s right, I am!
Once again!
I flew out into the sky…… as a black bullet!
……I release the 【Black Arms】 cover midway and return to my normal state.
I was already flying high above the land.
Below me spreads a beautiful forest.
Occasionally there’s a road, and people are walking on it.
If I turn my gaze forward, I can see a mountain range.
Is the so-called royal capital beyond that?
<Hyaaaaaa!!!>
Extra-sama is screaming.
But that scream sounds kind of fun.
Come to think of it, she became fond of such scream-inducing attractions a long time ago.
Now then.
I continue flying according to inertia and will eventually fall.
But I don’t mind at all.
Because thanks to magical power conversion and a sturdy body, I won’t get injured even if I fall from a high place.
But.
There was one thing I wanted to try.
“……Raa!”
I shout with a fighting spirit and deploy 【Black Arms】.
Thinly and widely to the left and right.
Just like…… wings.
These 【Black Wings】 I spread out couldn’t maintain their shape well at first, losing speed due to air resistance and staggering, but.
Gradually…… I became able to catch the wind well, and after a while…… I was able to glide comfortably through the sky.
<Hyaaaaaa!!!>
Extra-sama is still screaming.
I’m glad you like it.
Well, one way or another.
While flying in the sky.
I set off on a journey to a new land!
* * *
Now, the scene changes to the sea.
Zaratopu was gazing at Emi, who suddenly sprouted wings and started flying in the sky, with sparkling eyes while being rocked by the waves.
(Wow…… Anego is amazing!!)
While seeing off her figure getting smaller and smaller, Zaratopu thought.
(But still, humans can…… fly in the sky, huh!)
Because of Emi, Zaratopu was left with quite a lot of…… rather grand misunderstandings about the human race.
TL Note: I have been experimenting and starting to adopt a new line separation system similar to what the original author uses. That’s why you may notice a lot more line spaces in recent chapters.
