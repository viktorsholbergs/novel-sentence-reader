Chapter 37 Rumors of Rogue Cultivators
"Since you can refine premium Frostwind Talismans, with a bit more effort, Frost Descent Talisman is not without a chance."
Zhou Qingxuan's exquisite brows furrowed as her bright, lively eyes stared intently at Lan Chang'an, as if trying to exert some pressure.
The Frostwind Talisman could be considered a simplified version of the Frost Descent Talisman. Being able to refine a premium Frostwind Talisman meant his technique was already quite close to that required for Frost Descent.
If facing Zhou Qingxuan's formidable background, an ordinary cultivator might be trembling in fear right now.
After all, she was the beloved granddaughter of a Fake-Dan Immortal. Even if the Mu Family's Foundation Establishment Mu Renlong came in person, he would have to act courteously.
"Miss Zhou is looking too highly upon me," Lan Chang'an said indifferently. In his previous life, he was the Core Formation Ancestor of a cultivation family, so how could he be afraid of this little granddaughter's feigned ferocity?
"Miss Zhou, capturing a late first-rank Firebird doesn't necessarily require Frost Descent." Mu Xiuyun gently advised.
"I'm a spirit beast tamer. I must independently defeat and capture that firebird. Only then will it truly respect me and be easier to tame later. Frost Descent is the optimal choice, without causing it harm."
"Hmph! The newly opened Bamboo Leaf Market Town can't even find a skilled talisman master. We are too far from the Zhou Family Estate. Otherwise, why would this lady bother with a tiny shop like yours?" Zhou Qingxuan stood her ground, her pearly teeth biting her rosy lips, looking quite stubborn in achieving her goal.
Lan Chang'an inwardly mused that the young lady was pursuing perfection - independently capturing the firebird without help, yet also without harming the target.
From this perspective, Frost Descent was indeed quite suitable with its attribute advantage and powerful restraining ability.
For the young lady to place such importance on it, that fire bird's bloodline grade must not be low, at least a superior-grade one.
"Talisman Master Lan, are you really unwilling to help with this?" Seeing Lan Chang'an's indifference, Zhou Qingxuan wrinkled her jade-like nose as her exquisite, delicate face leaned in close, lightly taking a breath.
Less than half a foot away, the faint fragrance of a maiden mixed with her exhaled breaths.
Lan Chang'an felt a strange sensation in his heart. Could this young lady really be trying to employ feminine wiles?
His age was twice that of the other party's. If he had married as early as Li Ergou, Zhou Qingxuan would likely be around the same age as his daughter.
Just as the thought arose, Zhou Qingxuan's charming eyes flickered with a hint of mischief as her rosy lips moved, transmitting a cold laugh:
"Didn't expect Talisman Master Lan to actually like demonic beasts like the Earth Burrowing Rat?" Upon hearing this, Lan Chang'an's heart skipped a beat, no longer daring to underestimate this girl.
Zhou Qingxuan's exceptional talent for taming spirit beasts was well-deserved. Her earlier move of leaning in to breathe was not for any intimacy, but rather to confirm through scent that he raised an Earth Burrowing Rat.
This Earth Burrowing Rat was the spoils from slaying that Alchemist Ge Yi.
That Alchemist had obtained the beast taming token from Zheng Yuanhua as support.
The ultimate source was the Beast Taming Zhou Family!
"If my memory serves, my Zhou Family doesn't seem to have sold any Earth Burrowing Rats to your Mu Family. Oh, but you're surnamed Lan, so you may not necessarily be from the Mu clan." Zhou Qingxuan's lips curved into a deeper smile, as if she had suddenly grasped Lan Chang'an's weakness.
Lan Chang'an's expression changed slightly, but he was not panicked.
Indeed, a middle-grade bloodline spirit beast corresponded to a middle-grade spiritual root for cultivators and was quite valuable. The Zhou Family strictly controlled and recorded every spirit beast they sold. But if they had sold more than just one or two Earth Burrowing Rats, it would be difficult to pinpoint the exact one. Moreover, there were other avenues to obtain Earth Burrowing Rats.
"What does Miss Zhou intend?" Lan Chang'an remained expressionless as he took a step back, maintaining distance from Zhou Qingxuan.
He was unattached and could run away at any time, so he wouldn't be easily coerced.
"Talisman Master Lan, if you can refine the Frost Descent Talisman I need, this lady promises to owe you a favor," Zhou Qingxuan smiled radiantly, her expression pure and charmingly mischievous.
Lan Chang'an understood - this was a carrot-and-stick approach.
Such tactics at her young age.
Of course, the ultimate goal was still to have Lan Chang'an obediently put in his utmost effort to refine the talisman.
Upon hearing Zhou Qingxuan's promise of a favor, Mu Xiuyun present, as well as Shopkeeper Xu from the Rainbows and Silk Pavilion, couldn't help but be astonished.
A favor from the beloved granddaughter of a Fake-Dan Immortal carried substantial weight.
Given Zhou Qingxuan's spirit root talent and background, she could be estimated to become at least a formidable Foundation Establishment spirit beast tamer in the future.
"Give me ten premium frost-attribute talisman papers. I can only try, not guarantee success," Lan Chang'an sighed, looking resigned to accept.
Frost-attribute talisman paper was non-universal, made from the skins of corresponding attribute demonic beasts and spirit woods.
Its price was often more than double that of regular talisman paper, with a slight increase in success probability when forming talismans.
"Premium frost-attribute talisman paper? Good! I'll give you twenty, and if you can refine four, this first-grade talisman brush will be gifted to you as well." Zhou Qingxuan smiled warmly as she took out the talisman papers, also handing over a white premium talisman brush.
Lan Chang'an paused for a moment before accepting the papers and brush.
It seemed that from start to finish, he had been completely controlled by the Zhou Family's talented granddaughter. But who could know that Lan Chang'an's storage pouch already contained ready-made Frost Descent talismans.
This was simply resources and a favor being delivered to his doorstep.
The talisman brush promised by Zhou Qingxuan was a premium first-rank item, better than what Lan Chang'an was currently using.
"I can only try my best," Lan Chang'an cupped his hands.
"You have six days," Zhou Qingxuan said, her beautiful hair swaying as she left with her old servant.
"Are you confident?" Mu Xiuyun approached him, her voice gentle and her sleeve carrying a lingering fragrance.
Meeting her expectant gaze, Lan Chang'an pondered: "With the aids of this talisman brush and frost-attribute papers, I have a twenty to thirty percent chance."
...
The six days passed in the blink of an eye.
Zhou Qingxuan arrived at the Mu Family Spirit Talisman Shop as scheduled and sat in the reception room behind the first floor.
"Miss Zhou, these are the Frost Descent you need. I'm afraid my skill is lacking, so I could only manage three. Please take back this talisman brush." Lan Chang'an looked slightly ashamed.
He wouldn't be so foolish as to actually paint four Frost Descent talismans just for a brush.
Giving three should meet the other party's psychological baseline.
If four talismans were drawn, for a talisman of the difficulty of Frost Descent, it would almost be comparable to a first-rank superior-grade talisman master.
"Never mind, keep the brush," Zhou Qingxuan's expression didn't reveal whether she was satisfied or disappointed.
Finally, she glanced at Lan Chang'an before leaving with the talismans.
Lan Chang'an pocketed the talisman brush, his lips slightly pursed. Given her status, this outcome was unsurprising.
Mu Xiuyun smiled pleasantly. Although the goal of four talismans wasn't met, Zhou Qingxuan was satisfied.
"Talisman Master Lan, congratulations on gaining a favor from the talented Zhou Family granddaughter. How enviable," Shopkeeper Xu from next door came over with a smiling face, though he seemed uncertain, probing tentatively.
"Just fortuitous luck," Lan Chang'an humbly replied. This matter couldn't be hidden anyway.
Gaining a favor from the peerless daughter of the Zhou Family was indeed envy-worthy. Moreover, in painting those few Frost Descent talismans, he also fleeced a tidy sum of materials.
Lan Chang'an was in high spirits.
...
Over the next few months, the flow of people in the market town steadily increased.
The Spirit Talisman Shop, despite only being open for a year, surprisingly began turning a stable profit. Although the profits weren't massive.
The shop premises were bought at a low price from the Mu Family, so there was no rental cost, but holding costs and the market's management fees had to be considered.
The market's management fees went towards maintaining the formations and paying the patrolling law enforcement cultivators.
Lan Chang'an's days remained quite leisurely.
On one hand, the rich wood spirit qi of Bamboo Leaf Mountain meant he only needed to cultivate for an hour and a half each day.
On the other hand, the apprentice Mu Shan could paint simple first-rank talismans, while Mu Ershun could handle some basic talismans.
Lan Chang'an wouldn't spend all his time in secluded cultivation upstairs.
He often frequented the market town's teahouses and taverns, drinking tea and alcohol.
Such occasions where cultivators from all over gathered often brought some news and information.
Shopkeeper Xu from the Rainbows and Silk Pavilion would sometimes join Lan Chang'an for tea, casually chatting about matters near and far.
This shopkeeper was well-acquainted with the identities and backgrounds of various figures in the market town.
"Have you heard? Recently, a few wandering Qi-Refining cultivators were killed by rogue cultivators."
"What is this Bamboo Leaf Market Town? It's only been open a year, and there have already been a few vicious incidents of murder and robbery outside." Some wandering cultivators complained indignantly in the tavern.
"Rogue cultivators?" Lan Chang'an's expression turned contemplative.
Killing people and seizing treasures was not necessarily the work of dedicated rogue cultivators. In the market town, any occupation could temporarily turn to banditry.
With the market town gaining popularity, the emergence of rogue cultivators was quite normal. The patrolling cultivators could at most maintain safety within the market town itself and nearby areas.
"Talisman Master Lan need not worry about rogue cultivators. Have you heard of any shopkeepers in our market town being robbed?" Shopkeeper Xu poured himself a cup of wine, utterly nonchalant.
"That's true." Lan Chang'an smiled in agreement.
Rogue cultivators mostly preyed on the weak and helpless. Most shopkeepers in the market town had backing powers. Either their cultivation wasn't low, or they traveled in groups.
Rogue cultivators mainly targeted scattered lone cultivators, not daring to easily provoke these prestigious businesses.
"Lan Chang'an, my young master requests your presence." Just as the two of them were chatting idly, a servant boy came over and said in a low voice.
"Your young master?" Lan Chang'an looked towards the servant boy, who was at the third layer of the Qi-Refining stage.
Shopkeeper Xu transmitted a reminder: "Talisman Master Lan, this is an errand boy under Young Master Huang."
The Young Master Huang?
Lan Chang'an recalled the year before when Huang Yu had visited the newly opened Mu Family Spirit Talisman Shop, treating him like a nobody without even asking his name.
He didn't expect to receive a personal invitation from him today.
Shopkeeper Xu's expression turned grave as he transmitted: "The young master Huang is one of the administrators of this market town, second only to the presiding Foundation Establishment Ancestor. You'd better go make a trip there and not offend this person."
