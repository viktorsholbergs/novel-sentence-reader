Half a month later, Chen Xun remained seated in the same spot, motionless, observing intently. The small booklet in his hand was now filled with notes.
The seed had gradually grown into a Five Elements spiritual herb... A spiritual herb from the Qi Refining stage, something Chen Xun was very familiar with, yet it now appeared both confusing and unfamiliar to him.
Chen Xun sensed that due to the enhancement from the Water Spirit Art and the creation of the Five Elements Immortal Path, he had truly brought forth a new species.
His gaze grew distant as he recalled the Crane Spirit Tree they intended to plant on the giant ship. He decided to allow the mutant to run its full course.
“The three great tumors of our cultivation world, the three mutant brothers, should remain eternal.” Chen Xun slowly revealed a bloodthirsty smile. “Looking back, without the Crane Spirit Tree, this family would have fallen apart!”
**Roar!**
At that moment, a tremendous shockwave echoed through the valley. The light and shadow gradually shrank, and the big black ox had fully completed its transformation.
Each of the five Nascent Soul calves sprouted five small flowers, and the Five Elements Spirit Root had been formed.
“Moo-moo~~” The big black ox widened its eyes, searching for Chen Xun, and it finally spotted him in a corner, immediately rushing over.
"Old Ox." Chen Xun stood up and approached the big black ox. "How does it feel?"
The big black ox was so excited that it began circling around Chen Xun repeatedly, even starting to write. It felt as though it had broken through to a higher realm, gaining profound insights, including how to use the Five Elements Qi to form arrays and operate the giant ship.
"Oh, not bad." A flash of brilliance appeared in Chen Xun’s eyes. "After following me for so many years, you've finally grown some brains."
“Moo~~” The big black ox snorted contentedly through its nostrils…naturally.
Its gaze suddenly fixed on a spiritual herb behind Chen Xun, and it was instantly drawn to it. It nudged Chen Xun.
“Oh, right. Let me share with you my new discoveries. The pill formula should be fine now.”
Chen Xun held the ox’s head and began to speak enthusiastically. The big black ox listened with wide eyes, its admiration flowing endlessly like a mighty river.
Meanwhile, the female cultivators of Nine Palaces Mountain were already diligently performing their tasks, having been informed that this was a senior practicing a major technique.
They didn’t dare to spy, nor even discuss it, fearing the experience of becoming mortals again, something they never wished to endure for the rest of their lives.
Three days later, on an ordinary night.
The night was as thick as ink, dark and impenetrable...
It was like a dark blue curtain adorned with twinkling stars, making one deeply enchanted.
Outside the pavilion, a bonfire was lit, and four people, one ox, gathered around it.
Chen Xun and the big black ox sat in rocking chairs, while Liu Han, Shi Wujun, and Ji Zhao sat nearby.
They had all matured significantly.
Liu Han, dressed in black with long hair cascading to her waist, looked as fair as snow. Her jade-like hands rested on her knees. She remained silent. In the firelight, her snow-white face glowed, making her appear even more beautiful.
Shi Wujun’s thick eyebrows framed a pair of bright and clear eyes, like a pool of emerald water, pure and lively.
Ji Zhao’s handsome face was sharply defined, with well-proportioned features.
Under his heroic, sword-like eyebrows, his eyes were as bright as stars and as deep as cold pools, constantly shining with a determined light.
"Without realizing it, you all have grown so much." Chen Xun glanced deeply at the three of them and smiled. “Do you find cultivation boring?”
“Of course not, Ancestor. Your notes are endlessly fascinating.” Liu Han smiled at Chen Xun. Though he appeared stern, his character was actually quite amiable. “We are all about to break through to the late Foundation Establishment stage.”
"Indeed, Ancestor. We’re only in the Foundation Establishment stage, so we can’t afford to slack off.” Shi Wujun respectfully clasped his hands and said, “Venturing into the cultivation world without complete certainty is nothing short of courting death.”
"Ancestor, it’s said that those with Five Elements Spirit Roots have no hope in their immortal journey, so we must seize this opportunity and focus on our cultivation!" Ji Zhao spoke in a deep voice, revealing his cultivation level to be at the third level of the Qi Refining stage. “We must not seek to show off but should instead proceed steadily and surely.”
“Moo~~” The big black ox mooed happily and patted Ji Zhao. The concealment technique they used was a gift from Chen Xun after he had modified it.
Ji Zhao’s cultivation progress was slower than Liu Han and Shi Wujun due to the limitations of his spirit root, but fortunately, they had ample resources.
“After breaking through to the Golden Core stage, you should go down the mountain to experience the world.” Chen Xun took a sip of his herbal tea. “There’s no need to chase after opportunities. Focus on cultivating your heart. If you encounter danger…”
“Disguise, ambush, strike from the shadows, and eliminate all traces!” The three stood up and shouted in unison, “Never show mercy. That would be irresponsible to friends, family, and the sect!”
“Hahaha, good!”
“Moo-moo-moo~~!”
Chen Xun and the big black ox laughed heartily, pleased that their teachings had not been in vain. Starting their training young had indeed ingrained these principles deeply into their minds.
Seeing their ancestors so happy, the three of them couldn’t help but laugh along.
“Remember, don’t do good deeds lightly, nor should you commit evil deeds easily. You’re not yet at that level.” Chen Xun continued his patient guidance; his words calm and steady. “When you become powerful in your own right, only then will you have the right to express opinions. Until then, guard your words carefully.”
“Yes, Ancestor!” The three of them bowed, their eyes filled with determination. The Ancestor’s words were their truth.
Moreover, they had seen many of these principles in the small booklet, firmly engraving them into their hearts.
Because Liu Han was quite intelligent, she had once analyzed it for them.
The stories in those booklets might be the Ancestor’s personal experiences, and they weren’t just for intimidation.
“Sit down. There’s no need for formality tonight.” Chen Xun gently raised his hand.
The three were astonished, feeling as though they were being lifted not by force but by a pair of hands.
“Two Seniors.”
At this moment, a beautiful figure appeared from afar. It was Jiang Xuechen. A flash of surprise crossed her eyes. How could these two’s aura change again? They were so ordinary, so ordinary that they didn’t seem like mortals, nor did they seem like cultivators…
“Xuechen has arrived.”
“Moo~”
“Greetings, Senior Jiang.”
The three quickly bowed. Over the years in Snow Listening Valley, this senior had taken good care of them, even sharing some cultivation insights. And many of those insights came from the Ancestor of Moon Tower. The three of them had truly been blessed, enjoying great favor.
“Liu Han, Shi Wujun, Ji Zhao.” Jiang Xuechen nodded with a smile, then looked at Chen Xun. “I’d like to have a word with the two Seniors. Xuechen has some doubts.”
“Then sit down. We’re all family.”
“Moo~~”
Chen Xun and the big black ox responded amiably.
Hearing the words “family,” the three felt a warmth in their hearts and quickly stood behind them, behaving obediently.
The night breeze was silent, and the flames rose steadily, radiating light.
A trace of sorrow appeared on Jiang Xuechen’s face as she sat down beside them. No longer constrained by her status, she softly spoke, “Seniors, Ancestor Jin Yu has not yet returned.”
“When she left, did you not understand her intention?”
“Naturally, Xuechen understands and would never recklessly head to the Northern Territory. But even if it’s just her remains…” Jiang Xuechen lowered her head, her gaze vacant. “Seniors, is there really no hope?”
She couldn’t understand why she would choose to go without hesitation, even though it was a path to death.
The three disciples behind her also looked to their Ancestor, unable to empathize, not fully understanding.
