On the way back to Qin Immortal Mountain.
Chen Xun felt relief all over his body, already envisioning eighteen ways to cook the Red Lightning Wolf in his mind.
The big black ox also looked very content, occasionally casting a glance at Chen Xun. Its stomach was already prepared.
But when they passed by the Meditation Pavilion, it was unexpectedly lively there, with a crowd gathered in a circle, pointing, and discussing something.
The cultivation world never lacked cultivators who enjoyed spectacles, especially with the imminent Centennial Celebration of the City, where there were too many cultivators.
Originally, Chen Xun and the big black ox had encountered this situation a dozen times over the years, but they never cared to watch or express any opinions and were just about to mind their own business and leave.
However, upon hearing people around them mention something about "Li Miao," Chen Xun and the big black ox halted their steps and looked in that direction.
At the center of the circle was an old man with snow-white hair, his face wrinkled, his hair unkempt. He was at the ninth level of the Qi Refining, wearing a white robe covered in dirt.
He seemed somewhat crazy, arguing outside the Meditation Pavilion.
"Elder, I beg of you, let me purchase a cave dwelling. I have spiritual stones, I really do!" The voice of Li Miao was hoarse and pleading, and his eyes reddened. The ground was covered with dropped spiritual stones. "There will be Foundation Establishment Pills auctioned at next year's celebration. Elder, give me a chance!"
"The rules are the rules. You can come back to purchase after reaching Foundation Establishment. The Meditation Pavilion is not a place for charity." A man frowned and spoke. He had already visited several times, having advised Li Miao politely before. "Young man, three strikes, don't trample on the bottom line of Qin Immortal Mountain again."
As his words fell, the man's Foundation Establishment aura erupted instantly, a surging force pressing down toward Li Miao. Although this force wasn't lethal, there was a deep despair in his eyes.
He had never seen such a powerful force before. He was pushed back several steps, blood gushing from his mouth, and he collapsed on the ground. His body seemed like it was about to fall apart, but he suddenly became calm and no longer noisy.
Sometimes, real despair has nothing to do with pain or sadness. True despair, instead, brings peace to one's heart.
The surrounding cultivators kept their distance, some shaking their heads with bitter smiles, others with inexplicable mockery in their eyes.
"Go back to where you came from." The man snorted coldly, turning around, and walking toward the Meditation Pavilion.
With no spectacle to watch, the surrounding cultivators gradually dispersed. No one would pay attention to how a cultivator's fate would turn out.
A spiritual stone quietly slipped from Li Miao's body. He gave a bleak smile. "Even you look down on me?"
In the chilly wind, leaves swayed aimlessly, swirling in the cool air. This spiritual stone kept rolling, as if it were the final straw that broke his back.
The wrinkles on Li Miao's face grew deeper, his throat hoarse as he murmured, "Even you look down on me..."
At that moment, a large hand suddenly reached out, and on top of it lay the fallen, low-grade spiritual stone.
Li Miao slowly raised his head, greeted by a smiling face, accompanied by a black ox by the side. His pupils widened, quickly tidying up his clothes. "Elder, it's you!"
Over the years, he had met many elders, but none had ever given him an extra two spiritual stones. Chen Xun and the black ox had always been remembered by him.
"Moo~" The big black ox even picked up a few more spiritual stones nearby.
"Long time no see." Chen Xun wore a gentle expression. "Collect the spiritual stones. They're not easy to come by."
"Yes, Elder." Li Miao's voice was old and hoarse, no longer the hopeful middle-aged man he once was.
In such a situation, what he feared most was a sudden concern from a stranger, especially when that person was an elder.
He didn't know why tears welled up in his eyes inexplicably. He remembered that he hadn't cried for many years.
Chen Xun casually sat down on the ground: "Why do you have to purchase a cave dwelling on Qin Immortal Mountain?"
"Moo?"
The big black ox also squatted down beside him, looking puzzled. With these spiritual stones, Li Miao could first improve his strength.
"To be honest... my family has lived in the city for three generations, but because we don't have a stable place to live, some have left, others have scattered." Li Miao's eyes were dull and hopeful as he looked towards Qin Immortal Mountain. "If only I could buy a cave there... they wouldn't leave."
"I see. At next year's centennial celebration, the Alchemy Sect will auction Foundation Establishment Pills, which is also a way out for many scattered cultivators." Chen Xun patted Li Miao on the back, his eyes filled with encouragement. "When the time comes, just go and bid for one. Then come and buy a cave. I and the old ox will chip in one hundred spiritual stones. We'll be neighbors."
"Moo moo!!" The big black ox also nodded in agreement. Chen Xun had said: without stealing or robbing, hard working people will be blessed by heaven.
"Thank you, Elder, thank you, Elder Black Ox." Li Miao kept bowing and expressing his gratitude, tears the size of beans falling from his eyes.
"Let's go; I'll take you home. You're not in good condition right now." Chen Xun probed Li Miao's body, and his pupils slightly contracted. "We don't have anything else to do right now, so there's no rush."
Li Miao continued to bow, unable to say a word. Chen Xun forcibly lifted him up with his spiritual energy and then headed towards the North City.
Half a day later.
Behind the bustling North City, there were many invisible clusters of dilapidated huts. This was the gathering place for scattered cultivators, a chaotic mix of people trying to make a living in the city.
Li Miao was alone, living in a shabby wooden hut with only a bed inside, his situation seeming quite miserable.
Many cultivators passed by, all bowing and saluting when they saw Chen Xun, hastening their steps.
The big black ox stood outside the door, unable to squeeze in. The door was too small and dilapidated, making the situation quite awkward.
Outside the door was a withered tree, its branches bending in all directions, lacking any luster. Instead of attracting attention, it appeared desolate and bleak under the backdrop of the cold wind.
Chen Xun looked around, not minding at all, but he sighed deeply. If Li Miao were in the world of Qian Nation, he would have been a wealthy immortal teacher.
"Elder, I'm really sorry to have inconvenienced you for half a day. Please accept these one hundred spiritual stones." Li Miao trembled as he spoke, holding them up.
"As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, do I need your hundred spiritual stones?" Chen Xun chuckled, "Li Miao, you really don't give me any face."
"Elder, please forgive me!" Li Miao's expression shook, his hands trembling so much that a few spiritual stones fell to the ground.
Chen Xun waved his hand, his tone changing: "Focus on recuperating. Next year is the centennial celebration, so you must seize the opportunity."
"This junior will heed your teachings." Li Miao bowed deeply to Chen Xun, his eyes full of gratitude.
Chen Xun left with the big black ox, sighing softly. Looking at Li Miao, he seemed to see himself from years ago. If he hadn't attained immortality, perhaps he would have lived an ordinary life in the mortal world after crossing over.
Or perhaps he would have come into contact with the cultivation world and worked hard to obtain cultivation resources.
Without any surprises, he would have died with regrets in the depths of the mountains due to his limited cultivation aptitude, a process that seemed no different from Li Miao's.
The mentality of an immortal and a cultivator is ultimately different. They meet briefly, but all one can do is wish for a better outcome for him.
Li Miao leaned lightly against the edge of the bed, closing his eyes slightly. He felt his body ache, but he kept murmuring softly: "If only I could bid for a Foundation Establishment Pill next year..."
