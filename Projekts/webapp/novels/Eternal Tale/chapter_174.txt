Half a day later, Chen Xun and the big black ox stood at a distance outside Panning City, feeling both familiar and estranged. The city gate was still bustling with people, carriages passing through, and valiant soldiers standing guard.
However, the city walls had been renovated several times and no longer looked the way they remembered. They only glanced up briefly, their eyes calm and emotionless, before walking step by step into the city.
Upon entering the city, they saw pavilions and towers everywhere, red lanterns hanging high, but the streets had changed significantly, with shouts of vendors constantly reaching their ears.
"Old Ox, let's walk around first." Chen Xun quietly spread out his divine sense, observing the streets and the people, "Hehe, look, there's a candied hawthorn seller."
"Moo~" The big black ox nudged him, urging him to move quickly.
As they walked along the street, they strolled and stopped intermittently. Chen Xun held two skewers of candied hawthorns in his hand, feeling disappointed as he ate them and finding them tasteless.
The big black ox, on the other hand, enjoyed each bite, thinking that the candied hawthorns of Panning City were still the best.
Passersby pointed and whispered behind their backs, shaking their heads with a light laugh, amused by the sight of an ox eating candied hawthorns.
They walked from day to night, arriving at a secluded street where the shouts were noticeably quieter. There were a few teahouses and small inns, but no longer any blacksmith shops. Occasionally, a few martial artists passed by.
"Moo?" The big black ox was startled, looking around. Where was their shop?! They hadn't sold it!
"Old Ox, what are you thinking? This is the mortal world; there are laws here. It was probably taken back.” Chen Xun laughed heartily and started walking forward, "Let's go take a look."
"Moo~" The big black ox snorted, still not understanding. They hadn't sold the shop...
…
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood outside for a long time. This place seemed to be where Old Sun's blacksmith shop used to be.
"Sir! Please come in. I'll tie your black ox outside." At that moment, a smiling young attendant came out of the teahouse and said, "You won't find a better teahouse on this street."
The attendant had been observing from inside the teahouse for a while, certain that this gentleman wanted to come in.
"Yes, indeed, there's no better one." Chen Xun looked at him, gradually smiling, "We'll come back next time."
"Moo~" The big black ox took a deep look at the teahouse.
"Huh? Alright, sure." The attendant's heart sank, but he still warmly greeted them.
He watched the two figures leave, grumbling a bit to himself, feeling his time had been wasted.
…
This area still had many medical clinics, with most of the common people looking worried, many coming from outside the city seeking treatment.
But the northern part of the city had a prestigious family, passed down through generations, a family of physicians, the Ning family!
It was said that the Ning family's ancestral tomb was blessed, producing several imperial physicians, and many family members had moved to the imperial court.
_Whoa!_
Chen Xun and the big black ox inquired all the way, finally showing ecstatic expressions. It was no wonder the Ning family prospered!
This clinic now occupies a vast area, becoming the largest medical clinic in the northern city.
There were also two medical sages from the Ning family, Ning Yuanru and Ning Chongwan, overseeing the clinic, renowned for their miraculous skills and spreading their reputation to surrounding cities. Below the clinic's signboard still hangs the couplet from back then.
Today, Ning Yuanru and Ning Chongwan were sitting at a tea table in a room, discussing medical skills.
"Brother, this condition is probably related to the properties of the medicinal materials. The difficulty lies not in the medical skills."
Ning Chongwan spoke softly. She wore a white dress; her appearance was delicate, and she exuded a faint medicinal fragrance that imparted a sense of tranquility even from a distance.
"Third Sister, don't be anxious. If we start with the medicinal materials, how can the common people bear such a heavy burden?"
Ning Yuanru slightly raised his hand and picked up his teacup, his demeanor gentle and elegant, his words as warm and comforting as a spring breeze.
His eyebrows were long and clear, and his eyes held a soft gleam like the subtle luster of polished jade, appearing gentle yet incredibly resilient.
Ning Chongwan sighed softly and began flipping through ancient texts, hoping to find some wisdom from their ancestors on how they overcame such challenges.
At that moment, the tea in their cups rippled, and both of their expressions changed drastically.
Silently, a person and an ox appeared in the room!
"Who are you?" Ning Yuanru and Ning Chongwan's gazes sharpened.
Although there was a trace of panic in their eyes, they remained relatively calm, having weathered many storms. Such a level of skill was at least that of a grandmaster in the martial world, likely someone whom the Ning family had offended.
"There's no need to panic," Chen Xun said with a faint smile, a few breezes blowing through the room.
The breezes brought a sense of renewal, and the tables and chairs in the room looked as if they were brand new, like a celestial being had touched them!
The two were startled and stood up in awe, bowing their heads with the utmost respect:
"Ning Yuanru, at your service, Immortal."
"Ning Chongwan, at your service, Immortal."
Their expressions grew even more astonished. They had encountered a legendary immortal, yet their hearts were inexplicably anxious, unsure of the immortal's purpose.
"Moo~" The big black ox softly called out, sniffing twice. The strong medicinal fragrance was just like the one Chen Xun had back then.
"No need for formalities. We just came to see the Ning family." Chen Xun waved his hand, helping them up. "Your ancestor and I were old acquaintances."
Ning Yuanru was taken aback upon hearing this. Their ancestor had a connection with an immortal!
He respectfully said, "Immortal, please take a seat. Third Sister, quickly bring out the tea from the imperial city."
"Immortal, please sit for a moment. I will prepare it right away." Ning Chongwan's eyes shone brightly. She bowed gracefully and quickly walked out.
In the room, only the two of them and the ox remained. Ning Yuanru felt a bit uneasy. Years of cultivation seemed to break down in front of Chen Xun, making him feel like a child.
"It seems the Ning family has been doing well these years." Chen Xun sat in the head seat, smiling at Ning Yuanru. "I heard your discussion earlier. If you have any questions about medicinal principles, you can also ask me."
"Immortal, may I ask about your relationship with the Ning family ancestor..." Ning Yuanru's mouth was dry, but he still voiced his curiosity. "I hope the immortal won't misunderstand; I don't intend to disturb you."
How could he dare to ask an immortal about medicinal principles? They were likely not even on the same level.
"Ning Si was my master." Chen Xun's eyes showed a trace of pride. "Seeing the Ning family's legacy continue to this day, I believe his spirit would be gratified."
**_Ning Si?!_**
**Clang!**
Ning Chongwan had just brought tea to the door when she heard this name and trembled, causing the teapot to spill on the ground. Her eyes filled with shock.
Ning Yuanru's pupils contracted sharply, his heart in turmoil, and cold sweat instantly soaked his back.
That name was ancient, so ancient that it appeared after only a few pages in their genealogical records...
Although they had heard that immortals could live hundreds of years longer than mortals, it was impossible for them to live this long!
Wasn't this truly an ancient monster...
But the man's appearance was far younger than theirs, making them stand there as if struck dumb.
