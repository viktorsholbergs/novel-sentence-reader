But Yu Jingxin's expression still showed no fear, no shock, and no resentment.
It was as though he had long known this would be the outcome. The strength of the two before him surpassed him by far too much. His gaze, calm and composed, suggested he was even aware that Chen Xun might have held back.
Cultivators, when facing death, are ultimately different from ordinary people—especially those of the Nascent Soul stage, and particularly someone like him.
"Heh... as expected of Brother Chen."
Yu Jingxin lay stiff on the ground, a faint smile on his lips. His lifeless eyes stared at the dim sky as blood trickled continuously from his mouth. "Cultivation... is indeed exhausting."
"Moo?!"
The big black ox stared at Chen Xun in astonishment, perplexed as to why the latter knew him.
Chen Xun patted the big black ox solemnly and stepped forward slowly. His gaze fell on the lifeless Yu Jingxin lying on the ground.
The latter glanced at Chen Xun and, with great effort, took out an orange from his storage ring. "Brother Chen... here... for you."
Chen Xun accepted it gently, saying nothing.
"Brother Chen... is it snowing?" Yu Jingxin’s eyes bore no resentment or hostility. Instead, they seemed misty as he looked toward the horizon. "Ling Xiao... it’s snowing."
Chen Xun raised his head slowly, looking at the heavens. It was only the dispersing glow of the formation left by the big black ox. The Forbidden Sea Demon Nest would never see snowfall.
"Heh, Brother Yu, it’s snowing."
He suddenly smiled and sat down beside him. "It seems you are still the same person."
"If there’s a next life, I... only wish to be an ordinary man." Yu Jingxin's voice grew weaker, his eyes increasingly clouded. His vitality ebbed away swiftly. "Three or four close friends and a loving wife... would suffice."
Chen Xun gazed at him quietly and nodded gently. "If, in the future, I meet an ordinary man named Yu Jingxin, I will have two drinks with him."
"Then Brother Chen... it’s a promise... heh..."
"Definitely."
"... Thank you."
A look of nostalgia emerged in Yu Jingxin's eyes. Watching the swirling snow over the island, a faint smile spread across his lips. The pressure of a thousand years finally lifted, his soul redeemed.
Yet, a trace of sorrow lingered in his gaze—regret for failing his family, for disappointing the two elder brothers who had cared for him along the path of cultivation.
At that moment—
A hazy figure suddenly appeared in the dim sky. Yu Jingxin's eyes grew unfocused. It was the shadow from the depths of his memory—she had come.
The world said she lacked the beauty of a goddess, unworthy of him. But they could never understand that a beautiful woman pleases the eye, while a virtuous woman comforts the heart.
Ling Xiao, we have a home... I’m coming to find you.
He slowly closed his eyes, placing the storage ring beside Chen Xun. With a surge of power, he rapidly forced all the blood from his body!
Chen Xun's pupils contracted. The pool of blood on the ground grew larger, and even Yu Jingxin's body became emaciated... shriveled...
The big black ox was visibly shaken. What was this Nascent Soul cultivator doing?!
Above them, the light of the formation scattered like falling snow, reminiscent of the night Ling Xiao had departed, gradually covering Yu Jingxin's body.
Two streaks of tears finally rolled down his cheeks as he sank into eternal darkness, with a sense of release and relief... and a hint of remorse.
Chen Xun grasped the storage ring tightly in his palm, stood, and left with the big black ox. His steps were unyielding; for the first time, he did not destroy the body.
The little fox spirit swallowed nervously and glanced at Brother Xun, noticing something amiss in his demeanor.
The big black ox nudged Chen Xun lightly, understanding now why he hadn't used his artifacts—he had been afraid the death energy might ruin the body.
Together, they stepped into the teleportation array and vanished from the island, leaving no trace behind.
...
Two hours later.
Two patriarchs of the Yu family burst through the blockade of ancient warships, entering the Forbidden Sea Island with a roar. Covered in blood, they were fearless—their third brother was there!
They surveyed the devastated island, clearly the aftermath of a great battle. They had still arrived too late!
"Jingxin!!"
"Jingxin!!!"
Their anguished cries echoed across the heavens and earth. They rushed to the gravestone; their eyes reddened. Who claimed Nascent Soul cultivators were devoid of emotion? That was only because people didn’t truly understand.
Yu Jingxin was a member of the Jiang family. How could they not have known? Especially after that mortal world incident, there were far too many flaws, and the Jiang family had too many contingency plans in place.
In the past, there might have been infiltrators, but those Jiang family members typically only reached the late Nascent Soul stage, never gaining access to the core of the family. Thus, there was no need to openly break ties. In fact, they could even be used to suppress the Jiang family further.
The Jiang family’s decline over the years was not just due to sending their most talented disciples to the Yu family but also due to the Yu family's covert actions.
However, Yu Jingxin’s cultivation had indeed brought peace and stability to the Yu family.
The Yu family had long treated him as one of their own. True prodigies within the Yu family were rare, and they supported Yu Jingxin every step of the way until he achieved the Nascent Soul stage. The bond they shared went beyond mere familial bloodlines.
"Big Brother... Jingxin forced out his bloodline."
"I know."
The elder brother's eyes were calm as he crouched down, gently brushing the blood-streaked tear stains. In a soft voice, he said, "Third Brother, I understand."
The second brother’s expression was filled with grief and anger as he looked at the elder brother. Although Yu Jingxin might not have understood the elder brother’s intentions, one day he would. They had hoped to wait for that day.
Clenching his fists, the second brother’s chest heaved violently, his teeth grinding.
It was said that those covered in blood were either demons or the most terrifying beings in the world, capable of shaking others to their core.
Yet, the elder brother continued wiping the bloodstains from Yu Jingxin’s face, though it seemed impossible to clean away, and the wounds refused to heal...
"This... this is all because of the Jiang family," the elder brother muttered gravely, his voice barely above a whisper, not wanting to disturb his slumbering third brother. "Declare war. It’s time to settle this once and for all."
The one who acted here had already given them enough face—a warning, even. The Yu family lacked the strength to seek vengeance, as their trump cards were not meant for rogue cultivators.
"Understood, Big Brother," the second brother replied solemnly, his voice heavy with grief. The mysterious figure in the Forbidden Sea was beyond their reach to investigate. "I will begin preparations immediately."
The death of the third brother was a matter that no other faction dared to meddle in. This was a family affair, and when the full might of an ancient cultivation clan like the Yu family was unleashed, no one would dare to interfere.
The elder brother nodded gently, lifting Yu Jingxin's body in his arms. He did not belong here—he would always be their third brother.
Gazing straight ahead, his eyes burned with boundless fury that surged like a tidal wave. He would ensure the Jiang family understood the wrath of the Yu family!
Beyond the Forbidden Sea, cultivators in the Nascent Soul stage were still locked in a fierce battle against ancient warships. Dense purple mist swirled, preventing anyone from delving too deeply.
Suddenly, they froze, their gazes fixed on the rear of the warships. Two figures, their robes soaked in blood, emerged from the island. They were the patriarchs of the Yu family, their presence exuding unparalleled dominance, as though suppressing a raging storm of fury.
One of them carried a corpse—a broken body of someone at the Nascent Soul stage.
"How is this possible? Yu Daoist..."
A Nascent Soul cultivator muttered in a low voice, his heart trembling with shock. The fall had occurred too quickly, so quickly that even they could not fathom it.
To be slain so swiftly, the attacker was either part of an overwhelming siege or a cultivator at the mid-to-late Nascent Soul stage or beyond.
A killing blow delivered across thousands of miles in an instant—it sent chills down the spines of every Nascent Soul cultivator present. No one knew what Yu Jingxin had done to provoke such a terrifying figure.
In the 360 prefectures of The Great Li Realm, there were countless hidden experts. Even known late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators were elusive, either hidden away or presumed deceased. Who could say how many such ancient beings lay dormant?
The gathered patriarchs exchanged glances, their intentions ambiguous. They feigned a few token strikes before retreating in silence, their lingering schemes extinguished.
The two Jiang family patriarchs trembled faintly with regret. In the end, they had failed to save him...
At that moment, two pairs of fierce, murderous eyes locked onto them. Frowning deeply, the Jiang patriarchs immediately turned to leave. The Yu family must have discovered something.
Back then, Yu Jingxin's indulgence in mortal affairs was something the Jiang family hadn’t accounted for. Perhaps that was the fatal flaw, and it left a smoldering irritation in their hearts.
