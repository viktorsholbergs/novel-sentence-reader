With the Top Ten Sects turning a blind eye, the arrogance of the geniuses from various sects has become increasingly prominent, even dragging their respective sects into the fray.
In the past, it was always about individuals, not the sects. But now, it's as if the moment someone opens their mouth, they're criticizing someone from your sect, and your sect gets dragged into it as well.
It sounds absurd, but it's a recurring theme in the cultivation world, where darkness and bloodshed are constant occurrences.
Chen Xun and the big black ox simply refrain from participating and continue to avoid such situations, living their lives in relative peace.
As spring turns to autumn and the grand event is nearing its end, many independent cultivators haven't left the city yet. It's said that there are fights happening outside the city walls, and there are even arenas being set up.
Determining superiority and deciding life and death through battles of geniuses no longer satisfies them. In the past, the Top Ten Sects would have intervened in such matters, but now as long as it doesn't affect the city, they turn a blind eye.
It's justified by saying: What cultivators seek is enlightenment, and we of the Top Ten Sects will not block the path of our fellow Daoists.
In the eastern city, at a secluded talisman shop, the cold wind blew, and the two Crane Spirit Trees still stood in front of the shop, their branches lush and verdant.
Chen Xun and the big black ox guarded the shopfront, basking in the sun, listening to the gossip of passing Qi Refining cultivators.
"Old Ox, this cultivation world sure is dangerous," Chen Xun lay on the rocking chair, looking content, "You see, what I said back then was right, avoid conflicts, stay out of it. Ah~"
"Moo~" The big black ox also lay on a specially made rocking chair, listening to the gossip of the surrounding cultivators, munching on melon seeds as if it's their favorite pastime.
"But after the event, there haven't been as many people on this street." Chen Xun looked at the passing cultivators, "Old Ox, after this, let's go back to alchemy."
"Moo~" The big black ox hesitated, showing signs of struggle. Those words from Liu Yuan seem to be engraved in its heart, _'I don't have much time left.'_
But it ultimately listened to Chen Xun and nodded vigorously.
He glanced at the big black ox, noticing that all the merits in the merit book are gone. Those merits were accumulated after leaving the Five Elements Sect.
"Oh, didn't expect that the geniuses of the Limitless Sect actually admire the genius of the Mountain and Sea Sect, Celestial Maiden You Yu."
"What? The Limitless Sect and the Mountain and Sea Sect are sworn enemies, and there's such absurdity happening?"
"Hehe, indeed, the patriarchs of both sects have intervened in this matter."
These Qi Refining cultivators are quite gossipy, whispering mysteriously as they walk along the road. Chen Xun also listens with a smile. Reality is quite dramatic, but also interesting.
The big black ox isn't interested in these matters, preferring to listen to discussions about spirit beasts and occasionally joining in.
"Have you heard? A major incident has erupted in the central city area."
"What?"
As a few people pass by the shop, they talk excitedly, as if they've just learned a major secret.
Chen Xun and the big black ox also discreetly spread their divine senses and pricked up their ears, believing that good news should be shared with everyone.
"Seventy years ago, a genius from the Tianwu Sect killed a genius from the Five Elements Sect!"
"Is it Senior Yan Chuang, who emerged a hundred years ago? Who is said to be his descendant?"
"A descendant of the Spirit Root of Heaven..."
After hearing this, several people's pupils constricted, all looking at that person in shock, their eyes filled with astonishment. This kind of spirit root is something they dare not even dream of.
Damn!
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchange shocked glances, unexpectedly getting involved in their own sect's affairs.
"Hundreds of years ago, the Five Elements Sect produced a prominent figure, a man who was quite arrogant and domineering, who killed an elder of the Tianwu Sect."
"Friend Zhang, you knew about this?!"
"There's no need to hide it anymore. Let's hear about your mysterious identity."
A few of them swallowed nervously, their faces filled with shock, even their footsteps came to a halt.
"That's right." Zhang, standing with his hands behind his back, coldly smiled. "I am an outer disciple of the Tianwu Sect!"
"My goodness, I never expected that Friend Zhang would actually be a disciple of such a prestigious sect!"
"As expected, I had already sensed that Friend Zhang was extraordinary."
"Hehe, Friend Zhang, you made it quite difficult for us to guess."
The people around him started to flatter him, making Zhang feel increasingly proud, his expression growing more dignified.
"Humph, how can my Tianwu Sect let this grudge go? The Five Elements Sect deserves their punishment."
"Friend Zhang, what exactly happened in the central city area?"
"I heard that a peak master from the Five Elements Sect had a battle with an elder from our Tianwu Sect in the arena and was soundly defeated!"
"Incredible!"
"No wonder it's the Tianwu Sect."
As Zhang listened, he became even more pleased, as if he had personally defeated them in battle. But those people were gradually getting farther away, until Chen Xun and the big black ox couldn't hear them anymore.
Chen Xun furrowed his brows deeply, but he remained calm in his heart, having long been accustomed to unexpected events.
"Old Ox, let's go and inquire about what's happening in the central city area."
"Moo~"
They immediately got up and left. The counter in the shop was enchanted, and no one would come to take these worthless things anyway.
In the western city, at the residence of the Tianwu Sect, inside a loft.
A mid-stage Foundation Establishment young woman showed a charming smile. "Is everything ready?"
"Reporting to the peak master, everything is prepared. We're on our way to intercept the people from the Five Elements Sect."
Several members of the sect stood in front of her, their faces stern, unmoved by her beauty.
"The eighth-grade spirit stone mine in the Wu Nation has been occupied by the Five Elements Sect for a long time." The woman stroked the crystal-clear teacup with her slender jade fingers. "It's time to take it back now and take a little interest in advance."
"Peak Master, the Purple Cloud Sect..."
"A message has already been received from above. They will not interfere in the grievances between our sects." There was a hint of charm in her words, seemingly related to some cultivation techniques. "It seems that the Top Ten Sects have already figured it out. By forcibly restraining our grudges, how can we cultivators move forward?"
"Yes."
"Yes."
The people showed signs of delight, feeling deeply grateful to the Top Ten Sects. If cultivators don't compete, they can only wait to die.
"The outsiders may think that this is a private grudge between our two sects, and other sects will not intervene." There was a hint of killing intent in the woman's eyes, her words suddenly turning cold. "But Liu Yuan has forcefully come to the grand event every few hundred years. It seems she doesn't know how to write the word _death_.'"
"That person is just the alchemy peak master of the Five Elements Sect. Peak Master, her combat strength is not strong, she is nothing more than a defeated subordinate."
"But she is quite important to the Five Elements Sect. The intentions of the Top Ten Sects must have been unexpected for them. So, this opportunity is quite important. I hope everyone won't disappoint the Tianwu Sect." The woman narrowed her slender eyes. "No need to capture her alive, otherwise the Purple Cloud Sect is likely to step in and kill her."
"Yes, Peak Master!"
"Yes, Peak Master!"
The people were full of killing intent as they bowed and disappeared into the loft.
The woman looked up at the sky, a rare opportunity. With the Five Elements Sect weakened, they would lose a bit of influence in their words.
Starting a sect war was something no one dared to do lightly, as it was easy for others to take advantage of. Even if their elders were killed by others in the past, they could only endure it silently.
