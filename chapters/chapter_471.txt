Li Yuanjiao returned from the Eastern Sea after nearly half a year, standing atop the pitch-black Hooked Serpent and holding a massive white crucian carp demon that was the size of a house. Together, they made their way back from the north.
It was the height of summer, and the air was thick with the stench of fish. Li Yuanjiao tossed the white crucian carp demon into the lake and instructed Wushao to keep an eye on it before heading up the mountain.
Dressed in flowing white robes, Li Xijun rode the wind to meet him. The ever-stoic Li Yuanjiao had spent months chasing this demon fish with the Hooked Serpent across the vast Eastern Sea. At long last, they had captured the beast.
"The Eastern Sea is truly boundless! If one dives deep into it, even a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator might not be able to find their way about," Li Yuanjiao remarked.
If not for Li Wushao's familiarity with the sea and the fact that they had prepared well with formations to seal their target, catching this demon would have likely taken much longer. If Li Yuanjiao had gone alone, he would have likely been worn down to death by the endless swarms of sea creatures.
Li Yuanjiao then reflected, "Even with my Jing Dragon King Dao Foundation, it was an exhausting effort… No wonder so few cultivators venture to the Eastern Sea."
After hearing this, Li Xijun softly reminded him, "Second Uncle, since we have captured the demon, should we not inquire about the Water Virtue matters to confirm whether Senior Wushao's earlier claims were accurate, just in case?"
Li Yuanjiao nodded, understanding his concerns.
"I have already questioned the demon. What Wushao mentioned aligns closely with the sea's common knowledge."
He continued, "On this journey, I encountered a disciple of the Wanyu Sword Gate. He's a carefree swordsman named Cheng Gao. He had aided me greatly by pointing out several harmful demon dens. You should remember this to treat any members of the Sword Gate with respect in the future."
"Understood," Li Xijun replied.
Li Yuanjiao then asked, "How many people know that our family sought the secret method for capturing spirituality from the Yuan Family?"
Li Xijun responded, "Anyone passing through and encountering Senior Wushao will likely inquire about it… Word should spread soon enough."
"Good." Li Yuanjiao nodded in satisfaction.
Li Xijun then reminded him, "Fei Luoya has visited twice already, urging us to deal with Fu Daimu as soon as possible. He mentioned that he would visit again in about a month."
Li Yuanjiao waved his hand, signaling that he was aware. He thought to himself, In these next few months, I will take care of this matter once and for all. Better to handle it now than let it fester and become a future threat…
Li Xijun smiled and added, "Everything is prepared within and outside the peak for the dual sacrificial rituals. We are only awaiting the offerings."
"Good, good. It is commendable that you younger ones can manage everything so well." Li Yuanjiao nodded, smiling.
"That is due to elder brother's efforts in overseeing everything. I dare not take credit," Li Xijun responded humbly, then pulled out a letter from his sleeve as he continued, "A letter from the Azure Pond Sect—most likely about Brother Xizhi's efforts in handling the Fu Daimu matter within the sect."
"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion year upon year… Observing the three yuan festivals and six regular festivals, we maintain reverence—ensuring to pay timely respects… Through the smoke of our offerings and the blood of our sacrifice…"
The prayer proceeded as usual.
Blood qi and incense surged into the mirror, transforming into flowing talisman qi. This was the first time the Li Family had offered such a large number of sacrifices. Lu Jiangxian gathered the talisman qi into a mass in his hand, intending to insert a few cultivation techniques into it.
In the past, talisman qi did not come with attached cultivation techniques, but now Lu Jiangxian had amassed a mountain of cultivation methods, enough to bestow upon them for the next five hundred years—if not more. He expected there would only be more in the future.
The recipients of the talisman qi were naturally Li Ximing and Li Xijun. However, holding the talisman qi in hand and with so many techniques to choose from, Lu Jiangxian found himself at a loss as to what to include.
Lu Jiangxian weighed his options thoughtfully.
The Li Family right now isn't really lacking in various techniques... While there are many Foundation Establishment Realm techniques to choose from, gifting them might go to waste.
With Li Yuanjiao's breakthrough into the Foundation Establishment Realm, along with the addition of the Hooked Serpent and Li Qinghong as formidable assets, the family now had strong backing. Furthermore, Li Ximing, Li Xizhi, and Li Xijun also had the potential to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm. In another twenty to thirty years, these three could achieve their breakthroughs, finally solidifying the foundation of a prestigious clan.
The next goal of striving for the Purple Mansion Realm will likely be much more difficult…
He originally intended to perfect the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual and use it to cultivate a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. As there was no established Dao lineage for it in Jiangnan, he would not have to worry about external interference.
However, the current situation was fraught with uncertainty. Although Lu Jiangxian now knew many secrets about Purple Mansion Realm matters, his understanding was still hazy, making it difficult to gauge the temperament of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in Jiangnan. It would likely require multiple approaches.
"If a new Purple Mansion Realm family were to emerge, the Purple Mansion immortal clans of Chen and Xiao would probably welcome it... They'd be eager to see more Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to help alleviate the pressure on them. As for the three sects and seven gates, each has its own hidden agenda, making it difficult to predict the situation…"
His gaze shifted over the map of Yue State in front of him, eventually resting on the northern Yue Cultivating Sect.
"At the very least, neither the two sects nor the seven gates would want to see Shangyuan reach the Golden Core Realm. Though the Yue Cultivating Sect has always kept a low profile, Shangyuan has a righteous temperament. Which of the two sects and seven gates does not have some kind of shady dealings...? Another Golden Core Realm cultivator with a fierce sense of justice is not something they would welcome… As for the Buddhist sects, they'd be even less thrilled..."
Lu Jiangxian surveyed the surroundings and could not help but sigh.
"Shangyuan really is beset by enemies on all sides. No wonder there has been no movement; they are likely still engaged in behind-the-scenes power struggles and bartering interests."
Looking over the various cultivation techniques, Lu Jiangxian dismissed the Six Dams Azure Cloud Technique Manual—after all, the Yuan Family was still an ally of the Li Family, so gifting it would be pointless. Among the remaining options, the best was Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique, a Grade Four manual, but it lacked the essential spiritual qi.
Long Marching Pheasant Flame was a type of Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, and the original qi gathering method required locating a type of spirit flame called Long Marching Fire Essence. Only by using this fire essence to gather yang qi could one acquire the Long Marching Pheasant Flame. However, such flames were exceedingly rare in Jiangnan, making it difficult to extract the necessary qi.
"That should not be too difficult…"
Lu Jiangxian suddenly had an epiphany.
Li Yuanjiao still possessed a portion of Profound Yang Li Fire, which could be transformed into Long Marching Fire Essence through the Yang Nourishing Technique. Although this would be costly, the Li Family had changed considerably in recent years, and gathering the necessary resources should no longer be an issue.
"I am just not sure if this technique has any corresponding Dao Partners…"
Lu Jiangxian had studied many records from the ancestors of rogue cultivators, gradually piecing together much about the Purple Mansion Realms of the three sects and seven gates.
The Azure Pond Sect mostly followed the Water Virtue Dao, the Golden Feather Sect focused on metal, stone, sand and smoke, while the Yue Cultivating Sect practiced techniques involving true jade and cloud smoke.
Among the seven gates, only a few practiced the Fire Virtue Dao. Hengzhu Dao Gate to the south was the only one known for its mastery of fire techniques and blessing arts—placing it among the stronger of the seven gates.
"While the Hengzhu Dao Gate has a good reputation, the Azure Pond Sect is fully capable of sending a Foundation Establishment Realm clan under their governance to Hengzhu Dao Gate if they wanted to..."
For a moment, Lu Jiangxian felt a headache coming on. He set aside Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique for now, allowing the Li Family to explore the matter themselves. He then sifted through the heap of techniques and found a secret technique's manual—Chilling Snow Series.
Lu Jiangxian discovered this secret technique manual in a demon den while Li Yuanjiao was traveling along the Great River. It was a collection of three gathering methods for cold qi and a technique for searching for spirit water.
Though one of the cold qi collection methods overlapped with what the Li Family already possessed, it still provided an opportunity to help cultivate Slaughter Jun Kui Light to its entry level.
With the talisman qi carefully chosen, Lu Jiangxian refocused his efforts on completing the Purple Mansion Realm section of the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual.
