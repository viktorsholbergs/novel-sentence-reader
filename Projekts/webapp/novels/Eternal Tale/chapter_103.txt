Chen Xun slowly sat down cross-legged, while the big black ox soared on its sword, standing halfway up the mountain, looking up at the sky with a worried expression.
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox softly called out twice, with the great black coffin standing behind it, its eyes devout, continuously praying inwardly for the blessings of Buddha.
At the mountaintop, a golden elemental pill with Dao patterns entered the throat, just like the Foundation Establishment Pill from before.
Chen Xun's eyes gleamed with brilliance, and his expression suddenly changed drastically. A vast medicinal power continuously emanated from within him.
His entire body emitted a golden light, filled with a mysterious and profound Dao aura.
"Not right... There's a major problem with that Foundation Establishment Pill!"
A thunderous roar echoed in Chen Xun's mind, and his long hair, suppressed by the fierce bandit headgear, began to dance wildly. His body began to tremble violently.
It was a pain similar to expanding the Dantian but even more ferocious than before, as if his meridians and spiritual energy were being compressed and torn apart continuously.
And finally, the defensive power within him began to take effect, continuously protecting various parts of his body.
"Ah..." Chen Xun's pupils slightly reddened as he let out low roars of pain, his body undergoing changes within a bearable range.
And the golden light pervading his body grew stronger and stronger, finally beginning to affect the heavens and earth.
At that moment, a sudden change occurred!
Deep within the sea of clouds, a terrifying presence seemed to be brewing, accompanied by continuous thunderous sounds. The surrounding clouds churned, forming a vortex of terror.
But this vortex wasn't directed towards the ground but was hanging upside down towards the sky!
Chen Xun's pupils contracted; he hadn't even formed his pill yet! What's going on?!
The liquid within his Dantian also began to condense silently, shrinking rapidly.
With each contraction, there was a banging sound, as if being compressed.
The horror in Chen Xun's eyes deepened. Plans always lagged behind changes, it seemed like things had gone a bit too far...
Boom! Boom!
The deep rumbling finally came from deep within the sea of clouds. Dark clouds gathered, thunder roared endlessly, and the inverted vortex of clouds grew larger and larger.
Chen Xun's body radiated with a bright golden light, and a golden pill slowly began to condense within his body.
The big black ox looked puzzled. How could Chen Xun encounter thunder and lightning when forming his pill? Wasn't it snowing?
There were continuous rumblings echoing in the sky, and purple lightning streaked across. The big black ox widened its eyes, dumbfounded; something was wrong!
"Moo! Moo?" The big black ox called out worriedly towards the mountaintop.
In the blink of an eye, as the big black ox was lost in thought, a thunderbolt suddenly struck towards the array on the mountaintop, causing a violent tremor that reverberated through the sky.
The power of thunder seemed to pierce through everything, but at the moment of contact, a green light flashed, and a huge barrier rose, destroying a formation flag directly.
The formation power of the big black ox resisted the thunderbolt!
"Moo!!" The big black ox's eyes showed a few traces of bloodshot, roaring angrily, and its hooves were constantly pacing.
The violent spiritual energy stirred up waves of snow and surged towards the formation on the mountaintop, the ground continuously emitting intense thunderous roars.
At the mountaintop, Chen Xun suddenly opened his eyes, a dazzling golden light flashing. He seemed to understand something.
He looked at the wooden elemental pill and directly swallowed it without any hesitation.
Boom!
Like a bolt from the blue on a clear day, thunder roared through the sky.
Boom! Boom!
The sky changed color, the wind and clouds shifted, countless thunderclouds converged, and when Chen Xun swallowed the second wooden elemental pill, a vast and heavy black cloud formed, lightning flashed within, and thunder rumbled.
The wrath of heaven—this man was not tolerated by the heavens and earth!
A vast and majestic force descended upon the heavens and earth, directly locking onto Chen Xun!
"Boom! Boom!"
The sky darkened, black clouds covered the sky, and lightning illuminated the world, as if intending to completely obliterate this person.
Although Chen Xun's body was in some pain, he remained extremely calm, looking at the thunderous sea looming close by. Goodness, getting struck by lightning while forming a pill?
Why was he so calm? Naturally, it was because his adrenaline had surged to the extreme; he had never seen such a terrifying scene.
Legend had it that when others crossed tribulations, it was beneath the sky, but he directly crossed tribulations above the sky.
Facing the immense heavenly might, Chen Xun spoke with a trembling voice, "This disciple is forming his pill and crossing the tribulation. I hope the immortals and Buddhas will bless me... Give me some face..."
"Don't..."
Boom!
Before the words were finished, the heavenly wrath erupted, a thunderbolt tore through space, as mighty as a raging dragon, crashing down!
"Damn it!!!"
From the mountaintop, there came a thunderous roar that pierced through the sky, accompanied by the deafening roar of the heavenly tribulation, shaking the entire snow-covered mountain.
Everything was probably returning to chaos, but Chen Xun's mouth was still holding strong.
Halfway up the mountain.
"Moo~~~!!!" The big black ox widened its eyes and let out a long roar, but it could sense that Chen Xun hadn't encountered any mishaps yet.
If he encountered any trouble, it would immediately commit suicide on the spot, so it could follow Chen Xun in the next life. The big black ox had already thought about its retreat.
Suddenly, it felt a sense of relief, realizing there was nothing to fear anymore, quietly watching the vast heavenly tribulation, with some formation flags still intact.
The phenomenon was shocking, but it was inverted. Occasionally, passing peasants were frightened and prostrated themselves on the ground, believing the sacred mountain was manifesting its spirit.
Chen Xun had indeed chosen his location well, going against the norm, facing the tribulation clouds directly. Crossing tribulations upside down, even if witnessed by others, they wouldn't understand what was happening.
At this moment, the sky was filled with destructive thunderbolts, and Chen Xun was completely enveloped by the thunder sea. His body continuously emanated the power of thunder, crackling sounds resounding, and his bones, flesh, and blood were undergoing rapid transformation.
The big black ox was now in a panic, unable to see the situation at the summit of the snow peak, and even its divine sense was no longer effective.
"Moo~" The big black ox completely severed its connection with the formation, leaving everything to Chen Xun himself...
After a while, the big black ox suddenly held its breath. It seemed to hear an indomitable voice—it was Chen Xun's!
"Is this all you've got? Can you strike me, damn it?!!!"
...
The resounding voice spread throughout the snow peak, and the big black ox was so excited that tears flowed, directly kneeling down. Big brother is awesome!!
On the summit of the snow peak, the second golden pill was formed!
Chen Xun's eyes revealed boundless madness and calmness, his whole body displaying a blood-red color, carefully feeling the changes in his body.
"I absolutely cannot panic. Remember every sensation and experience with each step, or else how will the old ox cross the tribulation."
Chen Xun tilted his head slightly, his gaze heavy, looking at the inverted sea of thunderclouds. There was only himself left for the journey ahead; he must tread this path alone.
Above the sky, thunder rumbled, the tribulation clouds roiled, and within the thunder sea, the next terrifying thunderbolt was already brewing.
He had fully exposed all his defensive power—the entire spiritual energy shield—resisting the heavenly tribulation under the combined defense and spell amplification!
After enduring it, surprisingly, pure thunder power entered his body, continuously tempering it.
"The old ox is still waiting for me at the foot of the mountain."
A smile appeared in Chen Xun's eyes, accompanied by heavy breathing. His aura surged, the third water elemental pill entered his mouth, and he roared, "Come on!!!"
