Suddenly, the formation isolated sound and blocked external spiritual perception, but it didnâ€™t block smoke, etc... In fact, the room doesn't have a door.
It only has a layer of restriction on the surface to detect the cultivator's internal spiritual energy, which requires a jade plaque to activate, similar to the mist in the Nine Stars Valley.
There was a sudden shout outside the room, sounding quite urgent.
"Elder!"
"Elder, what's happening?!"
"Elder, why is there smoke coming out of the room?!"
"Ah?"
"Moo?!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox were surprised. It's impossible to eliminate the green smoke from the ritual. Otherwise, how could it be considered a ritual, lacking sincerity?
Chen Xun released a burst of spiritual energy, and the restriction emitted a faint light. Three cultivators rushed in, stunned. Why are there still incense burners and petals in the room...?
"It's okay, you can go down first. We'll take care of it later."
"I see. Then we won't disturb you, Elder."
The three of them breathed a sigh of relief, bowed, and left. They thought something had happened in the room, which was also their responsibility.
Chen Xun and the big black ox smirked helplessly as they wiped away the smoke and petals, feeling uncertain.
"Old ox, it's okay. Even if we missed it this time, there will be another auction next time. We'll prepare the ritual in advance." Chen Xun patted the big black ox, looking indifferent, "One thousand spirit stones... It's annoying, but we can afford it."
"Moo~" The big black ox's hoof also patted Chen Xun, comforting each other.
The auctioneer was still the same Nascent Soul stage elder. With his hands behind his back, he came forward and spoke a few words before the auction officially began.
One treasure after another was brought up onto the stage, and the bidding was still heated, but they still hadn't seen those two spiritual medicines.
However, something suddenly caught their interest, and even the big black ox straightened its head.
The old man held up an object resembling a map, and he smiled mysteriously, "This is the Five Elements Formation Diagram."
As soon as he finished speaking, many cultivators in the rooms exclaimed. The Five Elements Formation was a formation that combined killing, defense, and illusion.
This formation was widely known. Unlike the mountain-guarding formations of major sects, this was specifically designed for cave abodes and could be moved.
With sufficient spiritual energy support, it could even serve as a mountain-guarding formation for small sects!
The Nascent Soul cultivators in the Tai Gu Palace were excited, and their storage rings were already on the table.
However, the Nascent Soul ancestors in the top rooms seemed somewhat uninterested. With their vast backgrounds, this formation was like a chicken rib to them.
On the auction stage, the old man intentionally paused for a while before continuing, "Although it's a formation diagram, the materials are common, and it should be easy to set up step by step. Moreover, this formation not only automatically absorbs the spiritual energy of heaven and earth like mountain-guarding formations, but it can also absorb the energy of the Five Elements of heaven and earth, constantly operating. It's quite rare and can be considered a treasure. The starting bid is fifty thousand low-grade spirit stones! A fellow cultivator has already bid sixty thousand low-grade spirit stones."
"Seventy thousand!"
The price kept rising. Nobody was foolish enough to miss out on such an opportunity. Formation diagrams like this could be passed down for generations!
Moreover, it was the Five Elements Formation, more than enough to protect a small cultivation family.
In the room, Chen Xun and the big black ox were filled with energy. With the blessings of heaven, immortals, and Buddhas, they finally made a sale!
"Moo~Moo moo!"
"Old ox, damn it, buy it!" Chen Xun slammed the water cup on the table, "I've said it. If it goes over one million two hundred thousand spirit stones, you can take it all!"
"Moo~~!!" The big black ox was excited, constantly rubbing against Chen Xun.
"Old ox, set the price; we're not lacking in spirit stones in our family."
"Moo!"
The big black ox snorted heavily, sitting down next to the pillar, its heart pounding with excitement.
On the auction stage, the price kept soaring and had already reached one hundred fifty thousand low-grade spirit stones.
"A fellow cultivator has bid one hundred seventy thousand." The old man smiled as he paced on the stage, "With this formation diagram, there's no need to be proficient in formations. It's indeed quite convenient."
"Oh? The highest bid has now reached one hundred ninety thousand!"
"Two hundred thousand! Fellow cultivators are really generous. I am ashamed."
"Two hundred fifty thousand, what a discerning eye!"
The glow on the pillars of the auction stage noticeably diminished, indicating that many cultivators had given up as it was too expensive.
In the room.
"Bid higher, old ox, bid fiercely!" Chen Xun clenched the water cup in one hand and shouted behind the big black ox, "We have money!"
"Moo!"
The big black ox roared angrily, its forehead covered in sweat. These spirit stones were hard-earned over a hundred years, and now they were spending them all at once.
Although they initially regarded mortal wealth as worthless, that was because they could eat and dress warmly without needing riches. In the cultivation world, however, these spirit stones were closely related to their strength and future, and nobody could underestimate their value.
On the auction stage, the old man took a deep breath and said, "Three hundred thousand spirit stones. Does anyone else want to bid?"
"Three hundred thousand and one thousand spirit stones..."
"Three hundred ten thousand!"
"Three hundred fifty thousand and one thousand!"
The old man's face flushed with excitement. He hadn't expected this formation diagram to fetch such a high price.
In a certain room, a dashing young man cursed loudly:
"If I find out who's bidding, it's despicable. They're only raising it with one thousand spirit stones each time. Are they mocking me?!"
"Please don't get angry, young master. This is the territory of the Top Ten Sects. There are more auction items to come."
A middle-aged man's voice was low as he stood aside. "Using too many spirit stones now wouldn't be conducive to future bidding."
"Hmph!"
The young man's eyes flashed coldly. "This kind of auction is troublesome. I don't even know who's winning."
"Fine, I won't raise the bid anymore. I'm just a little annoyed."
"Understood."
With that, both of them looked towards the auction stage.
Bang!
With a final hammer strike, the item was sold for three hundred fifty thousand and one thousand low-grade spirit stones, a price higher than anyone had expected.
From their conversation, it was obvious that they already knew the list of auction items in advance. Such convenience was naturally aimed at those with status.
As for ordinary cultivators like Chen Xun and the big black ox, they could only follow the rules.
In the room.
"Old ox, we got it! Who dares to compete with us? Can anyone compete with us?! Is this all? Thirty-five thousand can't hold us back?!"
"Moo moo moo~!!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox shouted excitedly, embracing each other again, their mouths full of wild and unrestrained words. They had successfully completed the formation diagram.
Then, according to the rules, they handed over the spirit stones, and the formation diagram was delivered.
"Moo~" The big black ox took out a rare storage bag specifically for this purpose, then swallowed it in one gulp.
"What's wrong, old ox?" Chen Xun was very happy.
The big black ox ran over and rubbed against Chen Xun. It felt like it was too expensive. Chen Xun's furnace only cost a hundred thousand spirit stones.
"Why are you so petty? You rarely encounter something you like."
Chen Xun chuckled and slapped the big black ox, feeling no remorse at all. Even if it cost a million, he wouldn't bat an eye.
The big black ox snorted and nodded, but it gave Chen Xun a knowing look.
