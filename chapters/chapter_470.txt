The Li Family did not have many members in the Qi Cultivation Realm. Besides Li Xuanxuan, Li Xicheng from the foot of the mountain, Li Xijun himself, and Li Ximing in the alchemy room, Li Wen was their most trusted member.
Li Wen practiced the rapid cultivation method, Guardian of the Courtly Path, and became a Qi Cultivator before the age of thirty. While progress slowed down after reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm, his straightforward mind and diligent pursuit of the Dao allowed him to reach the third heavenly layer. He was on par with some of the external cultivators like Chen Mufeng.
Li Xijun had a positive opinion of this honest and loyal man, often seeking him out to practice combat techniques. Li Wen, in turn, did not disappoint, making significant progress over the past two years.
Li Wen nodded as he listened, his voice a low hum.
"I understand, young master."
Li Xijun smiled faintly as he sheathed his sword, and mentally calculated the days, thinking to himself, Ximing spends his days refining pills, yet his cultivation hasn't fallen behind much. At twenty-three years old, he's already at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. If I give him the white talisman from the pig demon, he might reach the fifth heavenly layer. If he reaches the eighth within seven years, with the help of talisman pills, our family could have a genius achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm in his thirties!
Thinking of this, Li Xijun mumbled to himself, "Perhaps I should ask Uncle Ping to relieve him of some more burdens..."
As he pondered these thoughts, Li Xijun walked for a while on Qingdu Peak, eventually arriving at the Alchemy Pavilion. He paused at the entrance, his expression turning strange when he heard moanings and grunting coming from within.
"My dear..."
After some time, the woman in the courtyard withdrew, and only then did Li Xijun step inside. He saw Li Ximing looking very relaxed while holding a jade slip, a satisfied expression on his face.
"Brother Ming," Li Xijun called out.
Li Ximing, seeing Li Xijun enter, put down the jade slip and tightened his belt, then smiled.
"What brings you here today?"
Li Xijun, who was naturally restrained in his behavior, frowned slightly, feeling the urge to reprimand him. However, seeing that Li Ximing was in a rare good mood, he decided not to spoil it and instead asked tactfully, "Where did that woman come from?"
Li Ximing replied, "She's a concubine from the Dou Family. It is difficult for cultivators in the Qi Cultivation Realm to have children... So, in my leisure time, I..."
Li Xijun let out a long breath as he noticed Li Ximing's anxious expression, and could not help but laugh.
"You are quite the lover of pleasures… I wonder who you take after."
Li Ximing forced a smile and said awkwardly, "Please, do not tease me."
Seeing that his brother's cultivation had indeed progressed with a growing aura, Li Xijun could not resist asking, "How long until you break through to the fourth heavenly layer?"
"About a year and a half," Li Ximing replied as if it were a matter of course.
Li Ximing had already broken through to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and Li Xizhi was at the fourth heavenly layer. Li Xijun sighed, "Your talent is truly enviable."
Li Xizhi was five or six years older than the two of them, so his higher cultivation level was expected. But with Li Ximing, who was of a similar age, it was different. He spent his days refining pills, occasionally reading alchemy texts, and in his leisure time, invited performers to listen to music, and was truly living a carefree life.
Li Xijun, on the other hand, spent his days diligently cultivating and honing his swordsmanship, yet he was still overshadowed, falling further behind with each step.
The cultivation gap between them was growing.
Fortunately, Li Xijun had a strong will and despite his frustrations, he maintained a calm demeanor. Although the two brothers had once had a big argument, Li Xijun, feeling guilty, could not stay angry for long. Meanwhile, Li Ximing, who had thoroughly enjoyed himself, felt comfortable, and there was no lingering resentment between them.
As Li Xijun pondered, Li Ximing shook his head thoughtfully and said, "Actually, every time I engage in such intimate acts, I feel an improvement in my cultivation. The radiant essence within me becomes more active, like a blazing fire… Perhaps that is why I have been able to break through to the third heavenly layer so quickly."
"Is that so?" Li Xijun was slightly taken aback, looking at him skeptically. "Are you sure you are not just making excuses to indulge yourself?"
Li Ximing feigned anger. "What are you talking about!"
The two laughed for a while, but then Li Xijun suddenly gazed into the distance, noticing two beams of light approaching from the east. They were intercepted by the Jade Court Guards as they neared the boundary and hovered in the air for some time.
"I'll go take a look," Li Xijun said softly before taking to the air. Due to the nature of his cultivation technique, the wind he summoned was cold and biting. In the lingering chill of the weather, he traveled swiftly and reached the Jade Court Guards within just two breaths.
The Jade Court Guard in front of him was from the Chen Family. Having just broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, he cupped his fist in salute upon seeing Li Xijun and reported in a steady voice, "My lord, these two claim to have been sent by the Xiao Family. They say they are here to see the ancestor and have a letter personally written by the Xiao Family's ancestor."
Li Xijun swept his spiritual sense over the two individuals, observing that one was an older man and the other a young woman. The old man had a dignified face with thick eyebrows and large eyes, and had reached the ninth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. The woman, with fair skin and good looks, was only at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She stood slightly to the side, glancing at him discreetly.
Seeing that the old man was at the ninth heavenly layer of his cultivation, Li Xijun subtly increased the distance between them before asking, "I am Li Xijun of the Li Family. May I ask which elder of the Xiao Family you have been sent by, and what is your purpose?"
The old man cupped his fist in response, saying, "I am Meng Taizhi, merely a rogue cultivator. Many years ago, while cultivating around the vicinity of the sword gate, I befriended ancestor Yuansi. Since my daughter's cultivation progress was lacking, he recommended that we come to the lake to find a place to gather the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth."
He then gestured to the young woman beside him. The woman, well-mannered and composed, bowed respectfully and said softly, "I am Meng Zhuoyun… Greetings, Senior."
Li Xijun accepted the letter handed to him by the Jade Court Guard but did not open it immediately. Instead, he used his mana to inspect it and, upon recognizing the familiar style of it, believed their story a little more.
"Please wait here for a moment. I will consult with my elders."
He then pointed out a place within the town for them to settle temporarily, instructing the Jade Court Guards to keep an eye on them before flying toward Lijing Town.
As a cultivator of Qingdu Peak, Li Xijun held a high status within the clan. He passed through the central hall where his uncle Li Yuanping sat at the head, with Li Xicheng listening beside him attentively.
By the time Li Xijun finished reporting the situation, Dou Yi had already unfolded the letter and presented it to Li Yuanping.
"...The Meng father and daughter have come to gather spiritual qi under the favor of our family's connection. They intend to stay for approximately twenty years. You need not treat them as guests out of regard for me, but they may be treated as guest cultivators and placed as you see fit. After twenty years, they may stay or leave at their discretion...
Daoist Taizhi is skilled in refining mineral essences, while his daughter, Zhuoyun, has trained under an alchemist overseas. They can both greatly contribute to your clan…"
Li Yuanping scanned the letter, confirming it was indeed written in Xiao Yuansi's handwriting. He then said, "Since it is at the request of ancestor Yuansi, send someone to ask the Meng father and daughter what they require and find a suitable place for them to get settled in."
Li Xicheng nodded in agreement, saying, "I will first test their abilities, then report back to the clan head."
Li Yuanping nodded. Xiao Yuansi's intention was clear—this was a mutually beneficial arrangement for both the Meng Family and the Li Family, and it was a kind gesture. While the Li Family might not urgently need these two, it was a rare opportunity to repay Xiao Yuansi's favor, and they should respond appropriately.
He coughed twice, frowning as he added, "Remember to have someone keep an eye on them."
Li Xicheng agreed, respectfully saying, "The family's sacrificial ritual has already been arranged, awaiting only the return of Second Uncle and Senior Wushao."
