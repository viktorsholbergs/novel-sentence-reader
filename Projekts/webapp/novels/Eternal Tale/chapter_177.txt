Half a year later, at Nine Palaces Mountain.
Due to the great war in the northern region, the Moon Tower had also completely sealed off its mountain, summoning back its female disciples from the city.
Nearly all the Golden Core elders had been dispatched, leaving only a few Golden Core female cultivators with special statuses to guard the sect.
In Snow Listening Valley, the mountain scenery was grand and magnificent, with peaks piercing the sky, vastly different from the outside environment.
The valley was quite spacious, with dozens of white grand halls standing in all directions, hidden formations around them emitting a milky white glow.
Deep within the valley, a faint rumbling sound could be heard. If one were to pass through, they would see a waterfall cascading from the sky.
From a distance, it looked like a silver ribbon embedded between the snow-covered mountains.
Looking up, the sky was filled with swirling crystalline snowflakes, resembling a heavenly maiden scattering flowers. The scene was romantic and chilling, with snowflakes blurring the world and adding a touch of enchantment to the human realm.
Today, at the peak of a small snow-capped mountain in the valley, a light footstep on the snow was heard.
Jiang Xuechen walked gracefully, her slender waist swaying slightly, her fair wrists showing through a light gauze, and her eyes filled with respect.
At this moment, the elder of the Moon Tower, Jin Yu, was sitting at a stone table with a pot of spirit tea and two teacups, but no one was sitting opposite her.
"Jiang Xuechen, paying respects to the elder."
"What is it?"
"Disciple had a sudden premonition today while diving in the cave and fears that an esteemed guest is about to arrive."
"Little girl, are you reminding me?"Jin Yu's voice, though aged, carried a sense of gravitas and timeworn wisdom. "They have been hesitating outside the mountain gate for half an hour."
"It seems nothing can be hidden from you, elder." Jiang Xuechen bowed her head and cupped her hands, the curve of her lips forming a perfect crescent.
The presence of a person and an ox outside the mountain gate had already alarmed the disciples of various peaks at Nine Palaces Mountain. Their origins were significant, likely Nascent Soul ancestors, arriving at such a special time.
Even the best sects could hardly find a Nascent Soul-level ox spirit beast. Moreover, this black ox's breed was unidentifiable, with no records in the entire cultivation world. It looked like an ordinary old ox from the countryside, yet this was the most terrifying aspect.
Jiang Xuechen's gaze tightened as she looked towards Jin Yu. A gust of snow blew past, and a late-stage Golden Core elder with a face full of wrinkles appeared respectfully beside Jin Yu:
"Elder, everything is ready. Open the mountain gate and welcome the esteemed guests at the foot of Limeng Peak."
"Yes." The elder responded respectfully and then transformed into a snow wind, disappearing into the valley.
"Elder..."
Jiang Xuechen's beautiful eyes widened in shock. Limeng Peak was considered the second most forbidden place in Nine Palaces Mountain.
There were seven supreme seats at the foot of the peak, corresponding to the highest-ranking individuals in Moon Tower. At its peak, even Nascent Soul ancestors had no seats there.
To receive two Nascent Soul cultivators with such great courtesy, could it be that Moon Tower was truly in decline...
A hint of sadness flashed in Jiang Xuechen's eyes. At least five ancestors from Nine Palaces Mountain had been dispatched to the northern war.
"Xuechen, these two are not ordinary."Jin Yu seemed to see through her thoughts. "They are very likely the two from that night."
"What?! Elder, it’s really them!" Jiang Xuechen exclaimed in surprise.
When the elder struck that night, those two hadn't moved at all, taking the hit without any damage.
"The flower is a main ingredient for the Nurture Pill. Besides the Top Ten Sects of Qian Nation and Snow Listening Valley, no other force possesses it."Jin Yu's eyes were sharp, even as she sat, her right hand gripping the phoenix-headed cane. "This flower is either for their descendants or... for themselves."
"Elder, could it be that they weren't Nascent Soul cultivators back then?" Jiang Xuechen took a deep breath, her shock growing.
"I was somewhat uncertain back then. Their clothing could block all detection."Jin Yu said in a deep voice, her grip on the cane tightening. "But now, they dare to appear openly, perhaps they have no more fears."
"Then why did my divination predict great misfortune?"
"Hehe."
Jin Yu shook her head and smiled. Back then, how could she have forcibly returned from the northern region without her two senior sisters predicting a great war in the north?
She had sacrificed her Nascent Soul's power, indicating she had no combat strength left, allowing the various forces to let her pass. To this day, she had not recovered, and she had been pretending to be a master that night...
The timing of those two arriving was too perfect, too coincidental, giving her the feeling of being manipulated. Moon Tower, unlike other forces, must have Nascent Soul cultivators overseeing it.
Otherwise, in these chaotic times, if something went wrong in a great war, Moon Tower would likely suffer the most, becoming nothing more than fine cauldrons and servant girls.
The hearts of those in the cultivation world were always unpredictable, and she never trusted those great forces.
But upon seeing those two, she couldn't help but calculate. If her guess was correct, it could lead to a great opportunity in the future.
These two were obviously itinerant cultivators. She had even sent people to investigate all major forces and the Top Ten Sects, finding no trace of Chen Xun.
Based on her attitude that night, if they had broken through to Nascent Soul, they would definitely seek out Nine Palaces Mountain. Moon Tower could afford to wait.
If her guess was wrong, those two were not the type to repay kindness with enmity. Moon Tower would not lose anything.
"Xuechen, let's go."
"Yes, elder." Jiang Xuechen followed respectfully behind her, not daring to speculate about the elder's intentions.
Outside Nine Palaces Mountain.
"Old Ox, what are the rules for visiting a sect? They’ve sealed their mountain gate! Damn it!" Chen Xun paced anxiously outside, holding a storage bag filled with local specialties. "We have no experience; we can't just shout loudly or forcefully break down the gate."
There were no places outside selling Nascent Soul techniques. They had only exchanged a few words with the Nascent Soul elders of Moon Tower, so they came here to seek an opportunity.
Given the current war-torn situation, going to other major powers would likely be seen as taking advantage of the chaos, leading to countless troubles.
"Moo~~!" The big black ox was also bewildered, following Chen Xun around.
In the past, they had always sneaked into places, either by digging a hole next to someone’s house or by blending in as errand disciples.
They had no experience with openly visiting a sect. This sudden situation was quite disconcerting.
**Boom...**
The protective formation of Nine Palaces Mountain trembled, several beams of light soared into the sky, and dense spiritual energy flowed out from the mountain gate, revealing a broad mountain path.
Chen Xun stopped and frowned, looking up at the big black ox. On both sides of the path, female cultivators from various peaks lowered their heads and cupped their hands in a gesture of welcome.
The mountain wind blew, and dandelion-like objects floated in the sky, creating an impressive scene.
"Wow."
"Moo~"
They exchanged a glance, feeling a bit excited. This was a completely new experience; they were undoubtedly being welcomed.
"Honored guests, we apologize for not welcoming you sooner. Please, come in."
A grand and powerful voice resonated like a bell throughout Nine Palaces Mountain, clearly from a Nascent Soul elder.
"Hehe… hehe." Chen Xun chuckled foolishly, quickly cupping his hands, and responding with a thunderous voice that echoed all around, "Thank you, fellow Daoist!"
"Moo!" The big black ox also let out a long bellow, not hiding its Nascent Soul cultivation level.
**Buzz!**
They ascended into the air, their vast spiritual energy erupting, a powerful aura surrounding them as they walked towards the formation.
"Greetings, senior!"
With each step they took, female cultivators around them lowered their heads in greeting, their hearts trembling with fear. What terrifying pressure...
Limeng Peak stood towering over the land, its peak suspended above a sea of clouds. The mountainside was a series of peaks, with emerald waters reflecting the mountains like a mirror.
At the foot of Limeng Peak were seven prestigious seats glowing with purple light, overlooking Nine Palaces Mountain below, giving off an intense sense of oppression.
Stairs seemingly made of glass extended beneath the seats, exuding grandeur. Stepping on them even produced the sound of celestial music.
Chen Xun and the big black ox ascended step by step, their gazes solemn but composed.
Five women stood at the center of the stairs, their clothes fluttering, slightly cupping their hands. Their eyes flashed with shock and curiosity as they looked at Chen Xun.
His aura was so strong that even the spiritual energy seemed to retreat, a phenomenon they had never seen even from their elders.
However, he had no majestic appearance, wearing a worn-out straw hat and gray hemp clothes, looking quite ordinary. Without the aura, they wouldn't have given him a second glance.
The black ox spirit beast was even stranger, adorned with pots and pans, producing a tinkling sound as it floated in the sky, also wearing a worn-out straw hat.
The elderly woman standing before the seats smiled and nodded at them, though her hand holding the cane trembled slightly.
Her heart was in turmoil. This ancient, legendary spiritual pressure had actually appeared...
_Early-stage Nascent Soul? Absolutely not. Who were they_?
The elderly woman's thoughts grew deeper.
"Daoist Jin Yu, it’s been many years. Apologies for the uninvited visit."
"Moo moo~"
A hearty laugh and a long bellow echoed in the sky as they stopped in mid-air, looking directly at the seats below Limeng Peak.
The female cultivators around them felt a pain in their eardrums, quickly using their spiritual power to block the sound. Even the five women at the center of the stairs had their expressions change slightly.
"Daoist Chen Xun, it’s been many years."Jin Yu's smile deepened. "Nine Palaces Mountain welcomes you!"
_"Nine Palaces Mountain welcomes you!"_
_"Nine Palaces Mountain welcomes you!"_
Her words echoed across the peaks, lingering in the air.
Countless female disciples were in an uproar. What kind of distinguished guests could make the elder act this way?!
Jiang Xuechen's pupils constricted sharply as she glanced upward, her eyes filled with disbelief. Chen Xun’s eyes were calm and composed, but a slight smirk began to form.
"Daoist Jin Yu, may we have a talk?"
"Moo~~~" The big black ox was elated. With strength, it was indeed better to visit openly rather than sneak around!
Everyone spoke reasonably, and their words were pleasant. The grand welcome was thoroughly prepared.
"Daoist Chen Xun, please!"
"Please!"
Chen Xun gestured, and then the two of them and the ox flew away in a streak of light. The female cultivators at the various peaks resumed their duties, feeling slightly excited.
As they walked, they engaged in heated, whispered discussions. The focus of their conversation had shifted from cultivation to Chen Xun and the big black ox.
