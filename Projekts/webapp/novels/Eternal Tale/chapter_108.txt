Today, the big black ox went busy again, while Chen Xun sat in the room, looking at his own arms, frowning slightly.
He wasn't smashing rocks to show off; it was just that the Thunder Tempering Body had dramatically elevated his physique, so he wanted to try it out.
His real skin gleamed with a silvery sheen, as if cast from silver, dazzling and magnificent, yet like the big black ox, he concealed his sharpness.
"If I could acquire another body refining technique, coupled with spells enhancing my spiritual energy shield and further reinforcing my defense..."
Chen Xun began to fantasize, "Even if it's a heavenly calamity, it's an opportunity bestowed upon us..."
It seemed that there was a limit to the corresponding heavenly calamity in each realm, always leaving a glimmer of hope.
Adding extra strength would give it ten chances of survival, making it quite interesting to exploit the heavenly calamity.
"Thank you, Heavens, for your bestowal." Chen Xun's eyes revealed solemnity and reverence, but the corners of his mouth were slowly lifting.
His physique had never been strong, but unexpectedly, this heavenly calamity had nourished him well.
Chen Xun quietly used his divine sense to look outside. The big black ox was still out there planting trees and shouldn't be coming in.
He took out an incense burner from his storage bag, chanting softly, sincerely saying, "Many thanks to the divine beings and Buddhas for their blessings, and thank you, Heavens, for granting me this favor."
"In the past, I had my brothers outside, making a lot of noise with the cattle. To make up for it, now, here I am, offering my respects to you all..."
"Moo~!"
Suddenly, the big black ox burst in excitedly, catching a whiff of the incense burner. Could it be that Chen Xun was performing some kind of beneficent magic?! How could it possibly exclude it from such matters!
Chen Xun's face changed drastically, filled with shock: "..."
The big black ox's eyes widened like copper bells; its body froze: "..."
Suddenly.
The door of the small house slammed shut, and magic directly sealed it off! From inside came a thunderous voice of extreme anger:
"The big black ox, daring to covet this seat, you shall die!!!"
"Moo?!! Moo!!"
There were screams of shock and horror coming from inside the small house, as the big black ox was directly blasted out.
But it was furious; Chen Xun had actually hidden his charitable deeds from it, so it charged back in, blasting Chen Xun out.
One man and one ox battled fiercely in the desert for half a day, rendering the sun and moon invisible, with yellow sand filling the sky.
In the end, Chen Xun forcibly bestowed ten points of his own merit on the big black ox, and only then was it satisfied, happily trotting off to plant trees.
After returning to the small house, Chen Xun's face was embarrassed, but then it gradually became relieved. Fortunately, he hadn't been discovered by the old ox.
His thoughts were myriad, gradually shifting to other matters.
"But what exactly is that Golden Dan? People in the alchemy hall have never heard of it, and I can't just pry into it."
Chen Xun frowned in contemplation. He had put a lot of effort into this breakthrough pill, spending fifty years refining it with powers surpassing limits.
Moreover, its pill fire had always caused the pills to undergo mutations, even removing the initial poison.
It was estimated that no one in the cultivation world had the strength and lifespan to refine pills like his.
"But that Foundation Building Pill indeed has issues, especially in expanding the Dantian. All of this is not a coincidence."
Chen Xun murmured, he and the big black ox now had five different golden pills inside them!
However, they all seemed somewhat dim, obviously not saturated, and somewhat unstable. Without the techniques for the Golden Dan period, they couldn't enhance their cultivation.
"I haven't heard of anyone in the cultivation world having several Golden Dan... Aren't they all just one?" Chen Xun coughed lightly. Having contact with fewer people has its advantages and disadvantages. "But it should be greatly beneficial for my lifelong magical treasure."
He took out a small booklet and began to write and draw, planning his future.
People always have to be hopeful about the future; otherwise, what's the point of immortality? Just wandering aimlessly everywhere...
In the days that followed, Chen Xun and the big black ox meditated daily to stabilize the five golden pills within their bodies, then nurtured the Crane Spirit Trees, occasionally discussing future plans.
They rarely used spells because this place couldn't replenish spiritual energy from the heavens and earth, so they used as little as possible.
The big black ox was constantly nourishing the Black Coffin with the power of the golden pills, intending to transform it into their lifebound treasure so they wouldn't need storage bags anymore.
Breaking into the Golden Core realm, their spiritual energy and spiritual power greatly increased, and they gained a deeper understanding of various spells.
Foundation Building could be said to be a leap in life levels, but the Golden Core realm was a leap in understanding the forces of heaven and earth, showing myriad fantasies that couldn't be compared to before.
At other times, Chen Xun held several small spell books, his eyes shining brightly. Some things he hadn't understood before suddenly became clear.
That feeling of enlightenment immersed him; some things could indeed only be touched upon when reaching a certain realm.
Compared to strength, Chen Xun was more concerned about how the realm affected his own comprehension. Even if their strength was formidable, it was only for self-preservation; they didn't enjoy fighting and killing.
Although life was meager, it was also fulfilling. They never had high demands for the quality of life; having a sense of ritual was enough.
...
Life is either exciting or plain; since one struggles to survive, one should strive to make every step towards glory.
In the blink of an eye, Chen Xun and the big black ox had been staying in the Tianduan Great Plain for 20 years. They decisively added the point of immortality to spiritual energy.
A lonely small house stood in the desert, completely concealed by an array, making it impossible to discern its shape.
With a 90-point boost from spiritual energy, coupled with the breakthrough of the Golden Core period, the big black ox's proficiency in formations had increased 'a bit'.
The vast expanse of barren land within the array was full of greenery, all sturdy and robust Crane Spirit Trees. Their emerald leaves were crystal clear, elegant as if painted, and full of vitality.
Boom!
A black ax filled with deathly aura suddenly disrupted this scene, ruthlessly chopping down a Crane Spirit Tree, which collapsed with a loud crash.
As it fell, it slowly withered and rotted, its spiritual energy gradually dissipating, a scene of extreme tragedy.
Another burst of flames, and the tree turned to ashes; this Crane Spirit Tree had thus completed its life cycle.
A figure slowly appeared under the scorching sun, his shadow seemingly shrouding all the Crane Spirit Trees in this area.
"Old ox, how's that!"
Chen Xun laughed heartily. With the complete suppression of the deathly aura by the Water Spirit Technique, their magical tools could be further enhanced.
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded in amazement, finding the ax even more effective than the iron essence ax from before.
It had now completely nurtured the Black Coffin within the Golden Core, able to control it freely; it was like a self-contained space.
With the added suppression of the Water Spirit Technique, there were no issues at all; it was simply tailor-made.
"But these three axes can't be strapped to the waist."
Chen Xun calmly remarked, looking at the three axes in his hand and at his waist with a hint of cherishment. These three axes were made from the materials of the Crane Spirit Tree King a year ago.
He had personally exerted all his strength to refine them with his pill fire, which was extremely sharp; one chop could break defenses, two chops could cause injuries, and three chops could break a banquet.
Finally, Chen Xun and the big black ox personally performed the rituals to consecrate them, giving them a resounding name: Breaking Wind!
