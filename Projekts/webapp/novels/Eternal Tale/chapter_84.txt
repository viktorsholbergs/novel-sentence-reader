At the edge of a cliff atop a mountain peak, overlooking the vast expanse below, stood four individuals and a black ox.
"It's truly breathtaking."
"I've never seen such a magnificent phenomenon in the heavens."
"So beautiful, so splendid! Senior brothers, junior brothers, look to the east, and the big black ox, come over here!"
"Moo~"
"But it seems to portend misfortune. Senior Chen, Junior Ox, you must be careful."
...
They exchanged words, their eyes shimmering with confusion, showing a rather shallow understanding, lacking the depth and breadth of knowledge possessed by their seniors.
"Why worry? Old Ox and I have been through thick and thin. If something earth-shattering happens, we can't escape anyway, so why not enjoy it?"
"Moo~"
"Hahaha..."
The three of them shook their heads and laughed heartily. Chen, Senior Brother, and the big black ox seemed to always be so optimistic.
Boom—
Boom—
Suddenly, a shocking change occurred. A vast starry sky trembled, and numerous massive meteors shot down, shining with white light, leaving a momentary brilliance in the eyes of all observers.
"Wow! Old Ox, lift me up! Quick!"
"Moo!" The big black ox stood up and lifted Chen onto its shoulders. Chen sat on the ox's back, gripping its horns with both hands.
They gazed at the meteor shower in the starry sky, standing at the edge of the cliff. Their eyes carried endless hope and bewilderment, wondering if those departed souls were there...
"Old Ox, make a wish quickly; it will definitely come true. This is a great opportunity!"
"Moo~"
They suddenly closed their eyes, enjoying the mountain breeze and chanting words full of sincerity. It seemed to be filled with piety.
Seeing this, Shi Jing smiled and nodded slightly at Ji Kun. Chen's friends were also his friends.
Yuan Yin sat on the edge of the cliff, and the silver ribbon that had been blown by the mountain wind ended up in Shi Jing's hands. He carefully tied it behind her.
The two had long harbored feelings for each other, sitting together with smiles of happiness on their faces as they looked up at the sky.
Ji Kun stood alone with his hands behind his back, standing at the back. His eyes constantly flashed with scenes of shooting stars, carrying a deep sense of gravity.
"Oh, oh, something's happening. Old Ox, Ji Senior Brother, take a look!"
The originally tranquil scene was suddenly disrupted by a voice saying, "When is the celebration? I have considerable expertise in festive occasions, hahaha..."
"Moo?" The big black ox turned its head with Chen on its back, looking puzzled. How did they get so close? These two people.
"Hey, hey, Senior Brother Chen, this is going too far, isn't it?"
Shi Jing blushed and quickly moved a few steps aside. Matters between men and women had to be approved by the master.
Yuan Yin, teased by Chen Yun, remained silent and buried her head. She was already very shy, and even though she had reached the Foundation Establishment stage, her personality hadn't changed.
"Hehe." Ji Kun chuckled.
"Yuan Yin!!!"
"Moo!!!"
Chen Yun looked at the starry sky and shouted loudly. The big black ox also joined in, and countless meteors streaked across the sky, both vivid and poignant.
After the roar, the entire mountain echoed with eerie cries and howls like ghosts and wolves.
"Come on, Ji Junior Brother, Shi Senior Brother, Yuan Sister, shout out loud! Such an opportunity won't come again, at least once in tens of thousands of years!"
"Moo moo!"
Chen Yun and the big black ox persuaded them. This was not the time to hold back; they should make grand wishes now.
The three of them had a change in expression, not quite keeping up with Chen Yun's train of thought. Cultivators should not engage in such mundane matters.
Unbeknownst to them, Chen Yun didn't give up. He urged the big black ox to lift each person one by one, including Yuan Yin.
In the eyes of the big black ox, there was no distinction between men and women, only others and Chen Yun.
"Hahaha..."
"The big black ox!!!"
"Moo~~!"
...
On the cliff, one after another, surprised shouts echoed along with discordant laughter. Eventually, they compromised.
The four people and the ox stood on the edge of the cliff, shouting towards the sky, creating waves of echoes in the mountains.
Chen Yun and the big black ox's voices were the loudest, astonishing disciples from all around who were now imagining things.
They began to chat again at the edge of the cliff, discussing only romantic matters and avoiding discussions about their cultivation levels. Everyone was avoiding this topic.
Surprisingly, this phenomenon of stars falling like rain lasted for a whole hour.
This event caused a huge sensation in various countries, even leading to temporary chaos.
The disciples of the Five Elements Sect continued to discuss, and most of them were ready to return for cultivation.
Gaining a bit more strength meant having a bit more self-defense ability.
The Jade Bamboo Mountain Range gradually quieted down, no longer as lively as it was just now.
The peak masters flew through the air, rushing towards the main hall of the sect master, where lights were already on.
On a certain mountain cliff, Chen Yun and his group had not left yet.
"Next year is the once-in-a-century grand event in Qian Nation, and Yuxu City is bound to be very lively."
Shi Jing spoke with a deep gaze, looking at everyone. "Both Senior Sister Yuan and I are going. I wonder if the two junior brothers will go."
"I will follow Elder Li, an outer sect steward; the order has been given." Ji Kun said it coldly, looking at Chen Yun.
"The event will last for a year, with three auction conferences organized by the Ten Great Sects. Many people from other countries will also come. Our master will also attend."
Yuan Yin smiled and said that now that she had reached the Foundation Establishment stage, her master would let them go out to see the world.
"I heard there will be battles among the geniuses of the Ten Great Sects and various events like the Flower Festival."
After saying this, Shi Jing's aura became much sharper. This was also one of his purposes for this trip.
Fighting against the geniuses of the Ten Great Sects and gaining insights through battles was much faster than cultivating in seclusion.
This was a truth that everyone who had participated in the sect's grand competition understood.
Of course, Chen Yun and the big black ox were exceptions.
Chen Yun looked at everyone, and a trace of embarrassment appeared on his face. He asked with a polite smile, "Hehe... How come I and Old Ox haven't heard about it?"
"Moo?"
The big black ox also looked puzzled, wondering if there was such a place on the map of Qian Nation.
