The battle at Lichuankou was already nearing its end by the time Li Xiangping arrived, with Ahuici standing out prominently among the battle formation, waving his sledgehammer in the air, while pursuing the retreating enemy forces.
As Mount Yue’s incursions continued unabated over the past few years, Ahuici had been summoned to Lichuankou by Li Xiangping to rally the tribes he was familiar with.
His bravery in battle had earned him the respect of the clan soldiers, bringing a sense of relief to Li Xiangping.
“How many times have those from Mount Yue made their appearance here this year?”
Li Xiangping furrowed his brow as he gazed at the distant mountains, his unease evident in his voice.
“This is the sixth time, Family Head,” Li Qiuyang, standing nearby, replied in a serious tone. His weary appearance suggested that he had just recently arrived here.
Now at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Li Qiuyang appeared much more mature than before. He had married the daughter of the Chen Family and had a son and a daughter of his own.
With a nod, Li Xiangping turned to enter the courtyard, leaving Li Qiuyang with a parting instruction. “Go freshen up and send for Ahuici to see me.”
Li Xiangping set the talisman brush in his hand down and gazed quietly at the cloth spread across the table. Having broken through the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and condensed the Jade Capital Chakra several years ago, he now found himself at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. With his current cultivation, he had long been able to wield the draw talismans with ease.
Meanwhile, Li Jingtian was in the room attending to the oil lamps. The girl was twelve years old this year and had blossomed into elegance with her swift growth and nimble movements.
Lu Jiangxian’s six talisman seeds had been distributed among the three surviving brothers of the Li Family, two of which were allocated to Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanfeng, while the remaining one was reserved for Li Tongya’s family.
Chen Donghe strode into the courtyard, clad in leather armor with a sword strapped to his waist. His gaze briefly lingered on Li Jingtian’s profile by the window.
“Family Head, Ahuici requests an audience!” he announced with his brow furrowed.
The young man, aged seventeen or eighteen, had already attained the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. With his clean appearance, he bore a slight resemblance to Chen Erniu.
“Come in.”
The beast fangs that Ahuici used to wear on him were nowhere in sight, and his attire was now replaced by a fur coat similar to those worn by the folks of Lijing Town.
“Great King, Great King! Bad news!” he exclaimed in a loud voice as soon as he entered the courtyard.
Behind him, Chen Donghe suppressed the urge to smack Ahuici’s head and instead kept his head bowed and discreetly positioned himself behind Ahuici to avoid Li Xiangping’s gaze while stealing a glance at Li Jingtian.
Meanwhile, Li Jingtian was busy trimming the wicks of the oil lamps by the window. The faint yellow light cast a soft glow on her profile. She was not an exquisite beauty, but she radiated poise and elegance.
Her facial features were full of vigor, with round eyes that took after her mother, Tian Yun, adding a touch of sweetness to her demeanor.
“What is it?” Li Xiangping asked, his lips curving slightly at the sight of Li Jingtian who was focused on lighting up the lamps.
Having condensed the Jade Capital Chakra, his spiritual sense was now heightened, allowing him to perceive the courtyard’s events without relying on sight.
“My brothers crossed the Big Fish Creek last night to deliver me a message. He said... he said Jianixi has dealt a heavy blow to the enemy army and will soon advance eastward!” Ahuici explained breathlessly.
The news sent ripples of concern through the courtyard, jolting Li Xiangping and Chen Donghe. Even Li Jingtian turned her attention in their direction, listening attentively.
“And what of Jianixi’s current strength?” Li Xiangping asked with a frown.
Ahuici lowered his head somberly before replying, “Jianixi should be at the middle stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He has unified all the hundred thousand people of Mount Yue in the northern foot of Mount Li, and likely commands five or six thousand troops, along with four shamans of the Qi Cultivation Realm who have absorbed the spiritual qi of heaven and earth. Additionally, he also has dozens of generals of the Embryonic Breathing Realm under his command. Fortunately, they’re all stationed throughout the northern foothills and do not accompany the main army.”
At these words, Li Xiangping hesitated, his brows furrowing deeply as he said, “Year after year, the Li Family has faithfully made offerings to the Azure Pond Sect. We have lived under their rule. Yet now, Jianixi, a mere representative of Mount Yue, dares to brazenly advance toward the east? Does he truly believe that Azure Pond Sect is powerless?”
Ahuici hurriedly kneeled down, pressing his forehead firmly against the ground. With a trembling voice, he reported, “According to the accounts of those who fled west, the Devil Gate... I mean, the Azure Pond Sect won’t intervene in this…”
Li Xiangping lowered his head, feeling a mixture of anger and powerlessness welling up inside him. Even Mount Yue’s pawns knew that the Azure Pond Sect would not intervene.
As the head of a clan under the Azure Pond Sect’s governance, he was left ignorant of whatever deal the two factions had struck.
“All of you are dismissed for now…”
Ahuici and Chen Donghe quickly took their leave. Once they were gone, Li Xiangping sank back into his seat, closing his eyes in silence.
“Father,” Li Jingtian called out softly.
She approached Li Xiangping, bowing gently before saying, “Our family faces the risk of becoming pawns for others. We must plan ahead.”
Li Xiangping raised his gaze wearily and prompted Li Jingtian to continue.
Li Jingtian lowered her gaze and said, “Jianixi’s bold advance suggests that the Azure Pond Sect and Mount Yue’s leaders have reached an agreement to cede territories and the mortals. However, they’ve failed to inform our Li Family, suggesting they wish to catch us unprepared…”
“Do you mean to say that our family has also become wheat ready to be harvested?” Li Xiangping raised his eyebrow and looked at his eldest daughter.
“I believe the Azure Pond Sect’s deal with Mount Yue only permits looting and pillaging, rather than total annihilation. With Fourth Uncle still in the sect and our alignment with the Xiao Family, the Azure Pond Sect should not abandon us without warning. That’s why I believe they have permitted Mount Yue’s incursion primarily for looting and pillaging, rather than killing the entire Li Family,” she explained.
Li Jingtian met her father’s gaze firmly and then continued, “The Azure Pond Sect interacts with various territories of Mount Yue, involving numerous tribes and clans. Therefore, given that Azure Pond Sect has struck a deal, it must feign ignorance regarding Mount Yue’s incursions. Each family is expected to rely on their own abilities to fend for themselves.”
As Li Xiangping listened, he stowed away the wooden slip he held and raised his head. “What course of action do you propose for the Li Family?”
Li Jingtian’s eyes held her father’s gaze earnestly as she spoke tentatively. “We must abandon our subjects and retreat to safety. Mount Yue’s raiding parties will not linger here. We can return to Mount Lijing within a day.”
“No!” Li Xiangping’s firm rejection brought a smile to Li Jingtian’s face, causing her round eyes to look even cuter.
“If we do that, we’ll be no different from the Azure Pond Sect!” Li Xiangping said while shaking his head.
When he saw Li Jingtian about to speak again, he raised his hand and cut her off with a weary expression on his face.
“I know what to do already. You can head back to Mount Lijing first.”
Li Jingtian nodded obediently and took her leave.
Li Xiangping slowly walked out of the courtyard with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing at the mountain forest under the moonlight.
A sense of foreboding gripped him. Jianixi was the most formidable opponent he had seen in years. He was a young leader with keen senses in wars, a cunning brain, and absolute strength.
“What kind of agreement has the Azure Pond Sect made with Mount Yue, and how much time do we have left…?”
