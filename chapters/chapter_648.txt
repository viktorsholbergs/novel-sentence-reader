Li Xizhi traveled swiftly to the Eastern Sea, riding the ocean currents for a time before arriving at Green Pine Island. The sea surrounding the island was in a constant state of turbulence, with exposed earth veins and erupting fire veins generating all kinds of spiritual qi.
On the island itself, many green pines had already collapsed. The area was divided into a dozen different zones, each guarded by disciples of various immortal gates. These zones had been adapted to suit different needs, harnessing various methods to collect spiritual qi.
He landed atop the peak, where a disciple in green robes sat cross-legged on the mountainside, seemingly waiting for some time. Seeing Li Xizhi arrive on a gust of wind, the disciple let out a sigh of relief and hurried forward with an anxious expression, saying, "Daoist, you are finally back! The sect has sent word that you need to escort a group to Splitreed Island and bring back some replacements. I have been searching everywhere for you!"
"Oh?" Li Xizhi had anticipated such tasks and had planned accordingly, knowing that he wouldn't miss any deadlines during his absence. He asked calmly, "When is the deadline? And where are these people?"
The disciple cupped his fist and replied, "There are still several months left. Now that you have returned, Daoist, I will make the necessary arrangements at once!"
The disciple left in haste, leaving Li Xizhi to shake his head slightly in puzzlement, thinking, The roster had been finalized long ago. Why the sudden change? Something about this is odd.
He waited quietly for a while until a cloudliner lifted off from the island. Taking flight, he surveyed the scene and noticed that the ship's passengers were mostly older Qi Cultivators, with a few Foundation Establishment Realm guest cultivators mixed in.
"Greetings, Daoist!" They saluted in unison. Li Xizhi waved dismissively, not wanting to waste time. He guided the cloudliner into the sky, only pausing over the ocean to observe more closely. He noted that, despite being reassigned from such a prosperous place, the cultivators showed little sign of dissatisfaction.
Feigning casual interest, he remarked, "What matter is so urgent that it requires your immediate reassignment?"
A man behind him hesitated before answering, "Daoist, we have heard that Splitreed market's spirit veins have begun to shift, and there may be an earth dragon awakening. We are being sent to assist the warden there."
Li Xizhi nodded, "So, it is about that. You will only be gone briefly, then. I was concerned it might be a long-term stationing that would rob you of cultivation opportunities. This is not as bad, then."
"Thank you for your concern, Daoist!" The speaker was a Foundation Establishment Realm guest cultivator who expressed his gratitude profusely before shifting the conversation to spirit veins.
Li Xizhi responded with casual remarks that gave the man some enlightenment. Reflecting inwardly, he thought, Most likely, this is Ning Heyuan's doing. He's gone to great lengths to stage all this—impeccably crafted, I must admit.
Once he understood the setup, Li Xizhi's interest waned. Sensing this, the man wisely fell silent. Day turned to night, and soon they arrived at Splitreed Island.
Splitreed Island was a well-known major island near the sea, drawing awe from the cultivators on board. Though it was his first visit, Li Xizhi followed the guidance to dive underwater, eventually locating the massive formation on the seafloor.
Just as they settled, a middle-aged man stood waiting above the market. With late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation level, he stepped forward as the cloudliner approached, stopping before Li Xizhi. His voice was steady and deep, "Are you Daoist Li? I am Ning Heyuan."
Seeing him personally come to greet him, Li Xizhi felt more confident in his assumptions. He replied warmly, "I am Li Xizhi. Greetings, senior!"
"You have worked hard, Daoist." Ning Heyuan's expression softened into a smile. With a gesture to his subordinates, he had them escort the ship's cultivators away. Then, extending a hand, he said, "Please, this way."
As they descended together, Ning Heyuan's demeanor radiated newfound stability. The past decade had transformed him more than the decades he had spent overseeing the sea. His bearing had become broader and more composed.
Ning Heyuan had come to understand why, despite the Ning Family boasting numerous Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and having brothers more capable than himself, Yuan Su had entrusted him with the family. The reason was the same as why he had been exiled overseas for more than ten years—his close ties with the Chi Family and the trust he had earned from Sect Master Chi Zhiyun.
Breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm could take five or six years at best, decades at worst. If the Daoist Master falls, who knows how long my aunt will last—or even if she will succeed. Until then, it is safest to have me managing the family. Ning Heyuan understood that his aunt's breakthrough was fraught with peril.
If Daoist Master Yuan Su were to fall, the Ning Family's greatest fear would not be the retaliation from the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators but rather the long-overdue reckoning from the Chi Family.
Once the Ning Family lost Yuan Su's protection, they would be no different from any ordinary clan. To survive, they had to secure the trust of the Chi Family. Appointing him—someone who was closely tied to Chi Zhiyun and who had been harshly punished for his association with the Chi Family—as the head of the Ning household was a wise decision by Yuan Su.
Ning Heyuan had once been sent to the southern border, only to be quickly reassigned to the harsh seas. It was only after much contemplation back at sea that he finally understood Yuan Su's deeper intentions.
Only then did he realize why, despite having been chosen as the head of the family, he was still relegated to such a desolate place, It's all to make Chi Zhiyun feel guilt… to make him feel indebted to me… to make him believe that I stand firmly on the same side as the Chi Family!
Having grown up by Chi Zhiyun's side, Ning Heyuan knew him well. Upon reflecting further, he couldn't deny that this plan of Yuan Su's was nothing short of brilliant.
This realization struck him with a wave of cold sweat, yet it dispelled all his resentment toward being stationed in such an inhospitable place. What replaced it was only admiration, and his demeanor took on a newfound composure and determination.
The two reached the interior of the cave dwelling and sat down. Ning Heyuan poured tea and watched as Li Xizhi made a motion to rise, unwilling to accept such courtesy. Ning Heyuan quickly pressed his hand lightly to stop him and said, "I went to great lengths to arrange this meeting, Fellow Daoist. Let us not concern ourselves with such formalities. Let us regard each other as equals."
Without giving Li Xizhi the chance to say more, Ning Heyuan swiftly shifted the topic, his tone turning serious, "This meeting is about the matter of Moongaze Lake!"
Li Xizhi understood and listened attentively, adopting a posture of focused attention. Ning Heyuan spoke softly, "First, we must ensure Yuanwu is removed, and that Yuanwu Peak relocates. We need to work together within the sect to ensure that six of the thirty-six peaks are selected to manage the new outpost. Securing Moongaze Lake under Qingsui's jurisdiction will make this plan mostly foolproof!"
Ning Heyuan continued hesitantly, "However, relying on my Ning Family alone may not be enough. Does your clan have any additional support?"
Li Xizhi nodded slightly, fully aware of this man's relationship with Li Xuanfeng. In a low voice, he replied, "With the Ning, Yang, and Li Encheng of Fuchen Peak, can this plan succeed?"
Li Xizhi had already considered this matter. In the initial planning stages, the Yuan Family was also a part of it. However, unforeseen circumstances arose, and the Yuan Family was now in disarray. Furthermore, his master had disappeared without a trace, leaving the Yuan Family's involvement uncertain for the time being.
