Liu Changdie simply waved his hand and laughed.
"To be frank with you, those fifty to sixty Spirit Stones would be just the cost. I am not after the Spirit Stones… but I do have a request!"
Li Xuanfeng quickly realized what Liu Changdie meant, and nodded as he replied, "Brother Changdie, feel free to speak. If it is within our family's capability, we will certainly not refuse!"
Liu Changdie paused to organize his thoughts before speaking softly.
"I have devoted many years to the study of formations. The deeper I delve into the principles and patterns, the more difficult they become. Acquiring a perception technique would double my effectiveness and allow for further progress. Unfortunately, despite years of searching in this region, the immortal cultivators guard their techniques closely… I have been unable to obtain one. If your esteemed family possesses such a technique and could lend it to me, I don't mind setting up another formation for you after completing this Earth Locking Huaqian Formation…"
Liu Changdie knew the Li Family possessed a perception technique called Spirit Eye Perception. He had long coveted it in his previous life but had never managed to obtain it. Since he had a good relationship with the Li Family now, he thought it was the right time to request it.
"Oh?"
Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, causing Liu Changdie to feel a bit uneasy. Li Xuanfeng put down his tea bowl and thought silently, Could this be a coincidence? Liu Changdie is strange but has shown kindness toward our family. Not knowing his background, we did not dare invite him to join our family as a guest elder when we only had a few Qi Cultivators. I even recently discussed this with Brother Xuan… Maybe we should take this opportunity…
Li Xuanfeng purposely feigned hesitation, furrowing his brow. "I see. It so happens that our family does have a perception technique, but we have never taught it to outsiders," he responded slowly.
"It was presumptuous of me!" Liu Changdie immediately exclaimed, lowering his head in disappointment as he apologized.
Li Xuanfeng couldn't hold back his laughter and chuckled as he continued, "If Brother Changdie is willing to become our family's guest elder, we can lend it to you without breaking the family's rules!"
"Are you serious?" Liu Changdie asked eagerly, clearly overjoyed. He had consistently demonstrated goodwill toward the Li family, yet had refrained from requesting to become a guest cultivator, fearing that his excessive enthusiasm might be misinterpreted as having ulterior motives.
Seeing Li Xuanfeng nod, he grinned and clapped his hands in delight. "That's wonderful! Wonderful indeed!"
Elated by the good news, Liu Changdie felt revitalized. In his previous life, he had never been a significant figure and spent most of his life humbly trying to make breakthroughs, often being scolded and ordered around.
Now that he was about to become a guest elder for the Li Family, his voice took on a more eager tone as he asked, "I heard that the main family had moved the formation plate from Mount Yuting to Mount Huazhong. How well is it working?"
"Ah... I was going to ask you about that," Li Xuanfeng said as he shook his head and continued, "The grand formation on Mount Yuting was operating at mid-to-late-stage Qi Cultivation Realm, but on Mount Huazhong, its power has been reduced to early-stage Qi Cultivation Realm. Do you know why?"
"The formation plate is not effective just anywhere. If I am not mistaken, the formation plate on Mount Yuting was specifically arranged to match the spirit veins there. Therefore, simply moving it to Mount Huazhong would naturally reduce its power!" Liu Changdie replied matter-of-factly.
He waved his hand and confidently said, "I'll go to Mount Huazhong in a few days and adjust the formation plate. You can count on me!"
Li Xuanfeng thanked him profusely. After some more conversation and laughter, Li Xuanfeng said, "I'll report this to the ancestor. As for the matter of Mount Huaqian, you can discuss it with my nephew, Yuanjiao, who is usually there."
Liu Changdie and Li Yuanjiao both acknowledged their tasks. After Li Xuanfeng left, Li Yuanjiao turned to Liu Changdie and asked, "Senior, what kind of spirit materials and how much labor will you need? I will start preparing right away."
Liu Changdie's mouth twitched with embarrassment as he awkwardly said, "Please, don't call me that... I'll write down the requirements later so you make the necessary preparations, Brother Yuanjiao!"
"I- I dare not be careless..."
Shamoli broke out in a cold sweat, lowering his head and staring intently at the ground. His mind was in a jumble, and he was mumbling a few vague responses.
Li Tongya, who was sitting at the head, glanced at him and commanded, "Come forward!"
Shamoli quickly got up and took two steps forward. Li Tongya glanced at him twice over and frowned slightly, thinking to himself, Although the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is indeed powerful, it also causes infertility. Shamoli indulges in wine and often engages in nightly revelries in his quest for offspring. It seems he also enjoys consuming various spirit materials in Mount Yue. His vitality is waning… If he continues like this, he won't last another hundred years!
Seeing Shamoli's timid appearance, Li Tongya thought of how diligent he had been over the years and advised, "You need to nourish and conserve your vitality. Do not overexert yourself."
Shamoli nodded repeatedly, though Li Tongya was unsure if the man fully understood his words. Having said all he could, Li Tongya's thought drifted back to the juniors in the family and mused, Now that I see what's happening to Shamoli, I should start finding some spirit herbs and elixirs to strengthen Qinghong's vitality...
Li Tongya was always considerate of his juniors, often prioritizing his own children after his brothers' offspring. He made a mental note of this and said, "Your eldest son has begun cultivating. He ascended the mountain and begged Xuanxuan to grant him the Li surname… He shows great potential. When he reaches the Qi Cultivation Realm, you should abdicate and focus on your cultivation in the mountains."
Li Tongya's words left no room for negotiation. Yet Shamoli felt neither resentment nor displeasure; instead, he was slightly moved and grateful. The gap between the Foundation Establishment Realm and the Qi Cultivation Realm was immense, and Li Tongya's politeness was already a sign of great generosity.
In the past, the high shamans on Mount Wu viewed Qi Cultivators merely as sources of nourishment. The people of Mount Yue had long learned the necessity of submission, and Shamoli was no exception.
"Thank you! Thank you, Ancestor!" he exclaimed repeatedly.
Li Tongya smiled upon seeing his obedience and submissiveness, saying, "I'm sorry that, as the ruler of Mount Yue, you will have to sit in a small chamber to cultivate when that time comes."
"I harbor no such thoughts!" exclaimed Shamoli, who had governed Mount Yue for four or five years. Knowing this was the moment to demonstrate his loyalty, he kneeled down with a resounding thud.
In a trembling voice, he declared, "If not for the main family, I would have perished in some forgotten corner of Mount Yue long ago! Now, I have reached the Qi Cultivation Realm and rule Mount Yue. What more could I possibly desire? I have no issue with my son inheriting the throne, that'll allow me to dedicate myself to my cultivation and revel in the spiritual qi of the immortal mountains. For this, I am eternally grateful!"
Upon hearing this, Li Tongya nodded in satisfaction, though his gaze remained on the sword in his hands.
"Good, you have grown. Stay on the mountain for a few months. In a few months, the family will need to catch a few demons… You will come along and contribute," Li Tongya said simply.
"I understand," Shamoli answered readily.
"You may leave," Li Tongya said as he dismissed Shamoli.
Only then did Shamoli slowly leave the courtyard, feeling his back drenched in sweat. He descended the mountain in a daze, his mind still fixated on the gleaming sword.
It took him a long time to regain his composure. He muttered to himself, "The Li Family now has a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator… That is excellent news! I can feel at ease, and the main family will not fear my rebellion. I no longer have to worry about being discarded after use."
As Shamoli walked along the stone path, the faces of the Li Family members flashed through his mind—from Li Xiangping and Li Tongya to Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling, then from Li Xuanxuan and Li Yuanxiu to Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong.
He felt both fortunate and contemplative.
"Years ago, joining the main family was a spur-of-the-moment decision… Yet, it put me on this great ship! That single choice could have turned me into another's slave, left me as a corpse in the forest, or elevated me to the ruler of a state, soaring through the skies as a Qi Cultivator... Endless hardships and countless strategies pale in comparison to that one pivotal moment. The rise and fall of fate in this world are utterly absurd!"
At just over forty years old, Shamoli had experienced more ups and downs than most people could in ten lifetimes. As he walked along the mountain path, his steps became lighter and lighter, feeling an immense weight taken off his shoulders.
