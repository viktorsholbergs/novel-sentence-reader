Under the cover of night, one man rode on horseback while the other rode along the wind. Li Xicheng held a jade slip and spoke softly, "During this patrol inspection, two individuals in Huaqian were caught hiding Spirit Paddies… They've been arrested as per the rules. What did the Clan Affairs Courtyard say?"
Chen Mufeng, a man around his age and deeply trusted, responded, "They have been brought to justice, but... one of them belongs to a minor sect of the second lineage... The eldest son, Li Chengchu, is practicing at Qingdu's main peak. This..."
Li Xicheng shook his head, replying softly, "It doesn't matter… Everything should follow the rules. The family head will decide their fate. Likely, he'll impose a severe or minor punishment and reassign him to a less critical role."
Chen Mufeng nodded as they continued along the river. Observing the verdant growth around them, Li Xicheng smiled and remarked softly, "Mufeng, our family is flourishing, with all lineages united. The external cultivators and those in the minor sects are emerging like bamboo shoots after rain. It's a golden era for us; truly a cause for celebration!"
Chen Mufeng smiled in agreement, replying, "The main family is the clouds in heaven, and we are the vines on earth. We're a single entity. Naturally, hearing this brings joy to my heart!"
Switching the jade slip to his other hand, Li Xicheng suggested warmly, "I have a concubine-born sister, Yunying, who isn't married yet. She's quite the catch for any promising Qi Cultivator. Are you interested in taking her as your wife? Perhaps I can arrange a meeting between you two soon. If you fancy her, it could be a wonderful union between our families, don't you think?"
Chen Mufeng was immediately overjoyed. He had remained unmarried since his wife's passing precisely for an opportunity like this! Now that he was finally given the chance to become part of the Li Family's second lineage, he nodded enthusiastically and happily replied, "Thank you, my lord!"
The two conversed for a while longer. Chen Mufeng, now working under Li Xicheng, felt a newfound closeness to him. His speech grew more relaxed as he leaned in and whispered, "Mufeng has been serving you for many years, yet a doubt still lingers in my heart."
"Speak," Li Xicheng encouraged, nodding slightly.
"My lord..." Chen Mufeng began, but just then, a cold wind descended from the sky, cutting him off mid-sentence.
A young man in white, with a sword at his waist and sharp eyes, rode the wind toward them. His gaze briefly met Chen Mufeng's before settling on Li Xicheng.
"Brother!"
"Brother Jun! Come, come..." Li Xicheng greeted as he warmly grasped his younger brother's hand, pushing Chen Mufeng's words to the back of his mind.
Li Xijun chuckled and suggested, "This is not the place to talk. Brother, why don't we ascend the mountain?"
"Of course!"
Together, they soared upward and landed in the small courtyard on Mount Qingdu.
Li Xijun pushed the door open and entered. With a wave of his sleeve, the room lit up instantly. He fetched two pots of wine and placed them on the table, then filled the cups.
He then said, "Brother, you're quite the figure these days… I've heard the Jade Court Guards are more efficient than the Clan Affairs Courtyard in overseeing the six peaks!"
"Nothing like that…" Li Xicheng chuckled, humbly dismissing the flattery.
Li Xijun chuckled as well and continued, "I've also heard that the impoverished families and branches you've assisted have reformed admirably. They've joined the peaks and even the Clan Affairs Courtyard and Jade Court Guards. Everyone speaks highly of you."
"You're exaggerating!"
Though the tale was well-regarded within the clan and Li Xicheng privately took pride in his foresight, he quickly adopted a modest tone in response to his brother's words.
Li Xijun waved his hand and added, "Our second lineage has nurtured many talents who now hold significant positions across various peaks... Having spent years in seclusion on the mountain, I rarely manage family matters. These successes are undoubtedly linked to your diligent training and leadership..."
Li Xicheng's frown deepened as he took a sip of the wine handed to him by Li Xijun. A realization dawned on him, prompting him to say in a stern voice, "I have never shown the slightest favoritism! These people have earned their positions through talent and hard work. If you, Brother Jun, suspect me of such, it severely underestimates me!"
"Brother, there's nothing wrong with what you've done."
Li Xijun, seemingly anticipating this response, shook his head. "If I believed otherwise, I wouldn't be so respectful towards you," he said with a comforting warm smile.
He raised his eyebrow as he continued in a cooler tone, "You can promote talent, forge alliances through marriage, influence the Yuting and two courtyards, and cultivate confidants among the peaks..."
Pausing, Li Xijun fixed his gaze on his brother.
"However, these are not actions befitting the eldest son of the second lineage… nor what Brother Ximing should be doing."
He set down his jade cup and squinted at his older brother.
"Big Brother, do you realize what you're doing? You're building your own support base and calming the masses. You're proving you're more capable than Brother Ming… forcing the family head to reconsider Ximing's leadership..."
At this, Li Xicheng's usually gentle face grew serious as he replied slowly, "There's no such thing as forcing. If any, it is the family forcing Ming'er, who clearly has no interest in these matters. You're misinterpreting my intentions... I'm merely acting in the family's best interest."
"The succession issue isn't settled yet!"
Li Xijun's expression tightened, his voice lowering, "Ximing can still father children! Even if he lacks the desire, his offspring could lead!"
Li Xicheng sighed gently, asking softly, "What do you think then, Brother Jun?"
This question left Li Xijun speechless. Torn between a brother stripped of power by his own action and an elder brother poised to reveal his ambitions, Li Xijun closed his eyes, unable to respond.
The elders in the family are probably allowing the situation to turn into this…
Unable to think of something better to say, Li Xijun then spoke in a subdued tone.
"I too bear responsibility for Ximing's plight… Since he was confined, the entire second lineage has been pushing you to act. Pressured by so many people, I guess you have no other choices either… I have no right to criticize you, Big Brother."
Li Xicheng nodded thoughtfully as Li Xijun's stern expression softened, and he continued, "However, those you have promoted, many have risen only through your favor and by leveraging your prestige, gaining support across second lineage… You must be cautious in how you utilize them."
"I understand," Li Xicheng acknowledged, prompting Li Xijun to cup his fist respectfully and say gently, "From now on, we two brothers will lead the generation of Xi and Yue. I trust you will act with prudence."
With a decisive sweep of his sleeves, he turned to leave. His white robe fluttered as he approached the door. Li Xicheng watched his tall figure, murmuring words barely audible, "Why didn't you ask if Uncle Yuanjiao has instructed me to do these things, Brother Jun?"
Li Xijun paused briefly, then took to the wind.
Li Qinghong emerged from three years of seclusion on Qingdu Peak after having spent some time stabilizing her powers at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation. Preparing to take a pill on either the first or last day of the month to break through to the ninth heavenly layer, she never expected Li Yuanping's sudden arrival.
Li Yuanping reported strange phenomena at Mount Wutu—surging clouds above the cave dwelling, faint sounds of dripping water within, and clear water bursting forth from the ground.
Even the weather at Mount Yue had grown erratic, with downpours ending as abruptly as they had begun, leaving the skies clear and the local fauna, including fish and turtles, scrambling ashore.
The Li Family had been through Li Tongya's breakthrough previously. When Li Qinghong heard these accounts, she realized that her brother, Li Yuanjiao, was nearing a critical breakthrough in his foundation establishment.
"Geez… Breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm is a life-and-death trial… How can he attempt it without telling me first?" she grumbled.
Although annoyed, Li Qinghong flew to Mount Wutu hurriedly and took up a vigilant watch outside the cave dwelling.
