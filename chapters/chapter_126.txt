Lu Sisi could only sigh in response and replied, “How could Lingyu Gate possibly be at fault? Their biggest mistake was their lack of strength… During the fierce battle at Moongaze Lake, Lingyu Gate lost a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm and six at the Foundation Establishment Realm. With only one cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm left, the gate was overpowered and destroyed.”
“The three sects argued that Lingyu Gate was too weak to fulfill their legacy of the Purple Mansion Realm, and then demanded that Lingyu Gate hand it over to them for safekeeping and cripple all techniques associated with it. Lingyu Gate had lost almost all of its territory… if they were to accept such humiliating terms, it would be no different than destroying their gate. Naturally, they refused and were ultimately wiped out,” he continued with a hint of sadness in his voice.
Li Tongya listened intently, silently nodding in solemn understanding.
“Do they have to push Lingyu Gate into the corner like that just to seize their legacy…? The Lingyu Gate was also quite stubborn. So then, what happened to the legacy?”
“It’s lost.”
“Lost..?” Li Tongya muttered in disbelief, an eyebrow immediately arching.
“Following the destruction of Lingyu Gate, that legacy of the Purple Mansion Realm was missing among their sixty-one jade slips. For over two hundred years, the three sects and seven gates have searched high and low for it, but to no avail…” Lu Sisi explained.
“Those people had besieged the market on Moongaze Lake because they heard news of survivors from Lingyu Gate there, and came to hunt for the legacy.”
The revelation struck Li Tongya deeply, triggering a memory of Zhang Yun’s words in the Snake Demon Cave.
“The River Mountain Sutra—lost after the destruction of Lingyu Gate—requires a secret technique to unlock…”
Could the River Mountain Sutra be that legacy..?
Li Tongya’s heart raced at this thought, but he forced himself to remain composed. The more he contemplated, the more convinced he became of this theory.
As Lu Sisi continued speaking, he pondered the secret technique mentioned on the jade slip.
Without the secret technique from the Lingyu Gate, there is no way to access this jade slip… looks like I can only hide it away at home until I am able to find a solution.
“Brother Tongya! What about the marriage proposal?” Lu Sisi’s question snapped him back to reality.
“It’s still too early for that,” Li Tongya replied, shaking his head with his eyes shut.
Lu Sisi’s expression turned a little somber. He set his tea bowl down and asked, “Brother Tongya, have you heard of the Yu Family to the north of Mount Huazhong?”
Li Tongya nodded and replied, “Yes, I have. Even the famous Wan Huaqian dared not venture northward because of the Yu Family’s presence… they’ve recently allied with the Azure Pond Sect and enjoyed relative peace.”
“Indeed,” Lu Sisi concurred, taking a sip of tea. “The Yu Family boasts several cultivators of the Foundation Establishment Realm and over a dozen Qi Cultivators. Their strength rivals that of prominent clans in Lixia Prefecture. Despite their recent alliance with the Azure Pond Sect, they’ve refrained from making any conspicuous moves…”
Li Tongya gave him a puzzled look and asked carefully, “Senior, are you suggesting that…”
“Let’s not beat around the bush and waste time… Brother Tongya,” Lu Sisi interjected gravely. “As long as you agree to the marriage proposal, your Li Family will be an ally to our family… otherwise, you will remain a threat to us. If I were to die, the Lu Family would have to find ways to protect themselves, even if it means welcoming wolves into our home!”
Li Tongya’s expression shifted as he asked solemnly, “What exactly do you mean, Senior?”
“We’ll offer Mount Huaqian to the Yu Family… and the Lu Family can always seek refuge in the Mushroom Forest Plain. At least… we may be able to survive there,” Lu Sisi stated bluntly as he set his tea bowl down with finality.
“You’ll either agree to the marriage proposal and pledge not to encroach on our territory, or wait for the Yu Family’s southward invasion, leaving you trapped between Mount Huaqian and Mount Huazhong that they’ll occupy!” he declared with an arrogant air.
Li Tongya fell silent and studied Lu Sisi’s demeanor silently in contemplation. Upon realizing that Lu Sisi was clearly not joking around, he replied, “Brother Lu, are you not afraid that I might retaliate and destroy your family?”
Lu Sisi burst into laughter. “HAHAHAHA! You wouldn’t dare! My younger sister cultivated at Moon Lake Peak and shared a strong bond with the peak master before her death… If you were to harm me, your younger brother would face dire consequences in the sect. I believe that you, Li Tongya, will encroach upon our territory… but not wipe out my family!”
Li Tongya looked at him and asked solemnly, “So which will you pick?”
“Either one of your two unmarried nephews, I’ll let Brother Tongya choose!” Lu Sisi waved his hand generously.
Li Tongya looked at him as he contemplated his options.
This is merely a temporary measure. The descendants of the Lu Family are all inept. Even this agreement is just a facade… as long as we can secure this old man’s loyalty, there are countless ways to dismantle the Lu Family’s influence.
Xuanfeng is Xiangping’s son, and his potential is remarkable… I cannot risk his future. I guess I can only sacrifice Xuanling…
After a few moments of silence, he spoke.
“Then it shall be Li Xuanling. He is my only son. I believe this marital union will demonstrate our family’s sincerity in this matter.”
Lu Sisi quickly agreed, but Li Tongya gave him a steely gaze, his lips curling into a sneer.
“Now that we’ve reached this juncture, Senior Lu should understand that while I may spare your family, the Li Family will continue to expand. You must find a way to secure the best outcome for both parties, or you’ll be sorry.”
The harshness of Li Tongya’s words was enough to convince Lu Sisi that he was making a serious threat. After contemplating for a moment, he gritted his teeth and relented.
“After my passing, Mount Huazhong of the An Family is the Li Family’s to take. The Lu Family shall not intervene!”
Li Tongya secretly curled his lips in annoyance.
How can the Lu Family intervene in the first place when they’re so weak? Offering what has already been given away is quite the strategic move.
Despite his thoughts, he was too lazy to continue arguing with Lu Sisi over such a trivial matter.
“It’s settled then. However, I would like to meet the bride first.”
As the words left his lips, Lu Sisi nodded eagerly. The girl standing behind him silently lifted her veil as though on cue, revealing a dignified and beautiful face along with her sparkling, large eyes.
Catching Li Tongya’s gaze, she lowered her gaze modestly and introduced herself, “Pleased to meet you, Senior. My name is Lu Wanrong.”
Li Tongya studied her for a moment. She was an outstanding beauty, and her possession of a spiritual orifice made her a suitable match for Li Xuanling.
Yet, despite the qualifications, Li Tongya found it difficult to reconcile the circumstances leading to this engagement. Nevertheless, he made a decision.
“Then let’s proceed with the engagement.”
With that simple statement, the fates of these two individuals were intertwined for the rest of their lives.
Lu Sisi expressed his delight, and the details of the dowry and the wedding date were swiftly decided.
Li Tongya’s expression held a mix of emotions as he regarded the old man before him.
“Senior, your dedication to your family is truly commendable. Your presence is a blessing for your entire family.”
Li Tongya’s comment caught Lu Sisi off guard. For a moment, an expression crossed his face momentarily, proving that he was also deeply moved by such a generous compliment. After a brief pause, Lu Sisi found his words.
“The younger generation of my family is indeed incompetent… This old man can hardly rest easily. Even in my old age, I have to worry about my family’s survival. It’s truly a shame!”
Li Tongya shook his head in response to Lu Sisi’s words.
Lu Sisi wore a conflicted look on his face as he continued, “I only pray that Brother Tongya will never have to experience such hardship… you will only understand the weight of it all when you are in my shoes!”
