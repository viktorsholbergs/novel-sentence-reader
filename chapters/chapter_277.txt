Tian Zhongqing had left with a wave of his sleeve, but Shamoli's heart was clouded with dark thoughts and wild speculations. Meanwhile, Tian Rong, oblivious to the situation, continued his incessant chatter, which only served to make Shamoli even more anxious.
He emptied his mind and pondered, What does Li Xuanxuan mean by this? I have been minding my own business in Mount Yue year after year, not touching the Li Family's spirit fields or items. Surely, they don't have a problem with me... Could this be a form of intimidation?
While Shamoli was still lost in his own thoughts, the carriage came to a sudden stop. Tian Rong, startled, thought Tian Zhongqing had returned and quickly fell silent.
However, he then heard the raspy voice of an elderly man shouting, "The main family's orders have arrived. Great King, how much longer will you wait? Do not miss the appointed time!"
"High Shaman! Please, come in!" Shamoli responded quickly.
An old man with white hair and a face full of wrinkles entered. Despite his aged appearance, his eyes remained sharp and focused. This was the old Mount Yue shaman, Ahuici, who had surrendered to the Li Family years ago. Now at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, he was too old to make any further breakthroughs.
Shamoli glanced at Tian Rong. Ahuici, with a raised eyebrow, understood immediately. He unceremoniously grabbed Tian Rong like a chicken and threw him out of the carriage, ignoring Tian Rong's incredulous protests. Tian Rong fell to the ground with a loud thud and continued to curse obscenely.
Ahuici frowned deeply, leaned out, and scolded, "Even your father has to address me politely! What the hell are you shouting about? How did Tian Youdao even create such a useless son? He should have pulled it out of his wife and shot you on the ground back then to spare us all this trouble!"
These words not only left Tian Rong trembling with anger but also made Shamoli's eyes widen in surprise. However, he pretended not to have heard his last comment. Ahuici ended his insult by spitting on the ground before turning back, saying, "Great King!"
Ahuici was an old retainer of the Li Family. He had accompanied Li Xiangping in the westward invasion, and Tian Youdao had only been a lowly soldier at the time, saved by Ahuici on several occasions.
Tian Youdao had always referred to him as "big brother," hence Ahuici spared no mercy in berating and reprimanding Tian Rong.
Shamoli hurriedly responded, "Yes, High Shaman?"
"Get ready and go!"
Ahuici's demanding words made Shamoli curse silently in his heart, but he could only nod in agreement.
When he stepped out of the carriage, he saw that all the tributes and ceremonial items had already been prepared. Even without his command, the national treasury had been emptied. He nodded awkwardly before joining the procession, muttering grumpily under his breath.
"Damn it!"
"An Zheyan is quite perceptive!" a young man said.
The black-clad youth sat cross-legged as he listened to the words of the person below him, nodding and smiling as he said, "He quietly settled the remaining members of the An Family in Lijing Town, spreading the old vow of offering two mountains far and wide. Over the years, he has made some progress and has learned a lot."
Now that Li Xuanxuan was managing the family, Li Yuanjiao had been sent to oversee the Clan Affairs Courtyard. His fierce temperament made him well-suited for the job.
"Indeed, he has made significant progress!"
The youth below nodded in agreement. His demeanor strongly resembled Li Xuanling, exuding a sense of steadiness. This was his son, Li Yuanyun, who was a few years younger than Li Yuanjiao. Li Yuanyun lacked a spiritual orifice and had always stayed on the mountain.
Now that Li Yuanyun had married a woman with a spiritual orifice, he could no longer remain on the mountain. He had moved down, established his own residence, and spent his days reading, investigating past matters, and occasionally visiting Li Yuanjiao's residence.
Perhaps due to his lack of spiritual orifice and not cultivating, Li Yuanyun did not possess a sharp presence. Instead, he had a gentle and peaceful aura.
After a pause, he continued, "Shamoli's eldest son has begun his cultivation. He was born to a woman from our branch family and has been learning the eastern customs since childhood. He begged the family for the Li surname and is now called Li Jiman. He appears quite loyal."
Li Yuanjiao smiled and nodded. This news was indeed pleasing. He paused and then said softly, "I received an internal report that the cave dwelling with spirit spring on Mount Huaqian is rich in spiritual qi. I'll be going there to cultivate in seclusion soon. We don't have many opportunities to talk as brothers, so I want to have a chat with you before I leave."
"That's good news," Li Yuanyun responded warmly and smiled as he continued, "Too bad Sister Qinghong went to Mount Huazhong a few days ago. Now that you are leaving too, it'll be just me idling around in Lijing Town."
Li Yuanjiao shook his head and reminded, "Hey, Qingxiao and Yuanping are only four or five years old. There are only a few of us in the generation of Yuan and Qing. Since Qinghong will also be cultivating in seclusion soon, you'll have to keep an eye on those kids when you can."
Li Yuanyun nodded and said, "I'll be going to Mount Yue in a few days to investigate some matters. I can bring a few toys for the two kids."
Li Yuanjiao was about to ask him more questions when someone hurriedly approached, interrupting their conversation.
"Report! Shamoli is here to see you, my lord!"
"Shamoli?! It seems he has come to pay his respects and sound me out... Let him in then!" Li Yuanjiao instructed.
Li Yuanyun, understanding the situation, tactfully prepared to leave, but Li Yuanjiao frowned and stopped him.
"You can stay and listen. We are family; there's nothing you can't hear. Just record what Shamoli says truthfully without any reservations," he said.
"It is widely rumored that you're Shamoli's main supporter, so I do need to listen carefully," Li Yuanyun teased playfully before sitting down again.
A tall Mount Yue man walked up from below. His attire was proper, resembling the easterners. With a wide smile on his face, he called out, "Brother Jiao, it has been so long!"
"I have missed you greatly, brother!" Li Yuanjiao replied with a smile. Noticing Shamoli's gaze lingering on Li Yuanyun, he explained, "This is Brother Yuanyun, one of our own. He will be heading to your territory in a few days, so please take good care of him!"
"Y-Yes! Of course..." Shamoli responded cautiously, his mind completely preoccupied as he had come straight to see Li Yuanjiao, and was not expecting to meet anyone else.
He said carefully, "Why have the family head summoned me in such a hurry…? I feel very anxious and uneasy."
"Oh!" Li Yuanjiao waved his hand and replied, "You have done well over these years. My elders want to see you, and perhaps even the ancestor will meet you personally. It's nothing serious, so relax!"
Hearing this, Shamoli breathed a sigh of relief. He wanted to say more but noticed that Li Yuanjiao seemed rather distracted. Realizing his sudden visit might have interrupted a conversation, he smiled and said, "With your reassurance, I am relieved. The family head's summons is important and should not be delayed. I will go up the mountain first and come back to see you when I have time."
He then left hurriedly. Li Yuanyun watched Shamoli depart and, after a moment of thought, said, "Since we have his son, Li Jiman, Shamoli has pretty much served his purpose... Besides, Li Jiman might even be more loyal than he is. However, Qi Cultivators have a lifespan of two hundred years… I wonder how the clan plans to deal with him."
Li Yuanjiao set his cup down and replied, "No rush. Shamoli's cultivation technique is excellent, and his strength is decent. When Li Jiman reaches the Qi Cultivation Realm, we can still use Shamoli as a guest elder."
Li Yuanyun nodded slightly but noticed a peculiar look on Li Yuanjiao's face. He continued, "The Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is truly extraordinary! It was once a Grade Four technique... Despite absorbing unrefined qi, Shamoli has reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm in just four years! That's fascinating indeed!"
While the two were chatting in the courtyard, Shamoli hurried up the mountain, not daring to fly directly. He walked along the stone path for a while before the small courtyard came into view.
Two clan guards stood silently in front of the courtyard. Shamoli, towering in stature, bowed his head as he entered and saw a middle-aged man dressed in gray standing at the top.
The middle-aged man had broad shoulders and was carefully wiping a sword with a rag. The sword had intricate scale-like patterns, reflecting a cold light. Shamoli stared at it in a daze for a moment before kneeling with a thud and bowing deeply.
"Shamoli greets the ancestor!"
Shamoli finally understood why serpent dragons had flown in the sky that night and why the Li Family had made such a commotion. With his forehead pressed firmly on the ground, he did not dare move, thinking in shock, Foundation Establishment Realm...! H-He… has achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm!
Li Tongya responded with a soft hum before glancing at him, slowly sheathing his sword. He began gently, "Shamoli, it has been a while. It seems you have been behaving in Mount Yue, and you've made significant progress in your cultivation as well!"
