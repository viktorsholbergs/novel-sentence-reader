The giant ship gilded right between the two figures. At the moment of contact, both of them lifted their heads and looked at Liu Yuan.
She was on the verge of tears, her entire body trembling uncontrollably. She had never expected Chen Xun to come and save her, nor had she ever wanted to trouble him with anything.
Seeing them safe and sound was already her greatest wish. She hadn't imagined they would actually come...
**Buzz**
The giant ship sped past, clouds swirling around it. The disciples inside the ship suddenly opened their eyes wide, looking at their bodies—surprisingly, they were unharmed!
The two black shadows were still standing in the sky, unmoved, but the terrifying pressure remained.
Ji Haoxuan's eyes were filled with immense shock. In an instant, he seemed to understand many things and deeply regarded the two black shadows. Liu Yuan continued to gaze at them, as if external factors could no longer affect her.
Ji Haoxuan felt his mouth go dry. Having lived for centuries, he naturally understood that such figures should not be casually inquired about—he still wanted to live a few more years.
Everyone inside the ship was looking toward the Tianwu Sect.
"Who are you two?" A trembling voice came from the sky, trying to suppress fear.
Xia Han's eyes held a mix of seriousness and fear. The disciples of the Five Elements Sect had escaped.
"We are disciples of the Tianwu Sect, under the Canghai Immortal Sect. We hope you will give some respect to the Canghai Immortal Sect."
She glanced at the sky on the other side, her brows furrowed. Why was her cousin silent at this moment? Fan Ping was also cowering in the back, his eyes filled with nothing but terror.
Men, it turns out, could not be relied on.
Xia Han was furious inside. She stepped into the air, facing Chen Xun across the sky.
"Us? Just some nobodies in the cultivation world," one of the black shadows finally spoke, his tone calm as he slowly drew out an axe. "We're just here to see off an old friend."
As his words fell, his entire demeanor suddenly became profound and transcendent. In an instant, the situation changed dramatically.
**Boom!**
**Boom!**
Terrifying and dull sounds echoed from the sky as his aura suddenly surged, and an immense deathly aura erupted.
The wind rose, and clouds surged like a black sea covering the sky!
**Roar!**
The other figure let out an angry roar, and the black coffin soared into the sky. The deathly aura rippled like waves, surging outwards.
The deathly aura was overwhelming and vast.
The surrounding spiritual energy seemed to emit a piercing buzzing, as if about to explode. If they were mortals, their eardrums would have long been shattered.
Xia Yuanqi, Xia Han, and Fan Ping, along with all the Tianwu Sect disciples in this realm, felt a chilling sensation shooting to the top of their heads, their breathing becoming increasingly rapid.
The shock in their eyes was about to make their eyeballs burst. This aura was unbelievably strong! Definitely not a Golden Core cultivator!
"Senior!"
"Senior, please wait!!"
"Senior, there's a misunderstanding!!!"
The three Golden Core grandmasters suddenly roared, their voices earth-shattering, filled with desperation.
"Run!!"
"Run for your lives!!"
The disciples of the Tianwu Sect screamed in terror, finally reacting. But at this moment, their internal spiritual energy was nearly stagnant, and the deathly aura continued to erode, sealing off all escape routes.
_No way to heaven, no way to earth!_
Chen Xun raised his hand, and the mountain-opening axe seemed to tower over the sky. His eyes were filled with endless coldness, his entire body shrouded in black flames, as if descending from death itself.
A red light ignited, and the axe blazed with an astonishing red flame, even evaporating a cloud above his head. The terrifying spiritual energy continuously erupted within.
**Buzz!**
A massive, earth-shattering axe light, carrying black and red flames, slashed through the sky, splitting the heavens, and striking everyone on the other side!
The dense deathly aura seemed to extinguish all life, destroy everything, pulling everyone into the abyss.
This scene left everyone in speechless horror.
The moment the axe light arrived, all the Tianwu Sect cultivators seemed to suffer a spiritual blow. Their pupils contracted simultaneously, yet their bodies remained intact.
Chen Xun slowly withdrew the axe, his gaze slightly focused, contemplating whether to clean up the aftermath or make a quick getaway. Fortunately, only three Golden Core cultivators were chasing Liu Yuan, without any Nascent Soul elders.
If there were a Nascent Soul elder, he would only be able to escape with Liu Yuan. Crossing major realms in battle was too risky. When he first broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage, he had felt it was nearly impossible.
The gap between major realms would only widen with increasing cultivation levels, making it an act of suicide. After all, such deeds were meant for the chosen ones. What did they have to do with someone seeking immortality?
"Moo!!"
The big black ox snorted in shock. It had never seen Chen Xun use his axe before and had assumed he was just playing around with it for hundreds of years.
The black coffin still hovered above its head, but it seemed unnecessary now—big brother had already taken action...
At this moment, the sky was eerily silent. The deathly aura remained thick, and the people of the Tianwu Sect stood motionless as if untouched.
Their expressions were frozen, stiff, and their faces started to turn pale. Even the four giant ships had stopped flying, trapped in an uncanny stillness.
On the other side of the sky, the members of the Five Elements Sect felt their scalps tingle, utterly bewildered. What kind of monsters were these? They were definitely not cultivators, nor were they human!
"Heh heh... heh heh." Ji Haoxuan laughed foolishly, losing all semblance of his usual demeanor as a peak master. Inside, he was in turmoil.
Liu Yuan's expression was complex. She looked into the distant sky, wanting to say something but ultimately remained silent.
The disciples of the Five Elements Sect were drenched in sweat, horrified by the bizarre situation with the Tianwu Sect cultivators in that part of the sky.
**Boom!**
**Boom!**
Several low sounds echoed from the sky as the giant ships began to disintegrate, and the Tianwu Sect cultivators started to break down, returning to their natural state.
Everything was being obliterated, with continuous sounds of shattering.
A massive ripple of spiritual energy spread out, impacting the sky, and even causing the giant ships on their side to shake slightly.
All traces were thoroughly erased, leaving not even the debris of the four giant ships, obliterated in the river of time.
**Gasp!**
**Gasp!**
The sound of sharp intakes of breath was heard everywhere. Everyone was rooted to the spot, marveling at the power of a legendary strong figure.
Liu Yuan smiled sweetly, looking at the now-vanished figures, and said, "Let's go back to the sect."
"Yes, no matter what, the Tianwu Sect's actions towards our Five Elements Sect must be accounted for!" Ji Haoxuan, energized, roared angrily, "The Tianwu Sect has lost three Golden Core cultivators this time. I will report this to the sect master and seek justice for Junior Sister Liu."
Now, the Tianwu Sect was effectively crippled in front of the Five Elements Sect, and a personal visit to discuss matters was in order.
"Thank you, Senior Brother," Liu Yuan replied politely, her eyes now calm.
**Buzz**
**Buzz**
The giant ship sped through the sky towards the Five Elements Sect. This time, although it was a close call, the gains were considerable.
However, everyone knew in their hearts about the two mysterious figures and respected their own lives. The secret to longevity in the cultivation world—mind your own business.
In a deep, remote forest... Two figures walked slowly through the woods, covering miles with each step, leaving behind the place of trouble.
"Old Ox, quick hands!" Chen Xun chuckled, giving the big black ox a hearty slap, "Did you get the storage rings?"
"Moo~~!"
The big black ox's eyes gleamed with pride, its tail swaying. Although the storage bags of the Foundation Establishment disciples were destroyed, the storage rings had been preserved.
While Chen Xun fought off the enemies, it, the big black ox, was surely going to help collect the spoils.
"Hahaha..." Chen Xun laughed heartily, "Old Ox, as usual, destroy all techniques and magical artifacts, leave no traces."
"Moo~~!" The big black ox grinned, understanding.
The two figures walked through the forest, chuckling slyly, disposing of their loot along the way.
Chen Xun suddenly sighed. It wouldn't be bad to encounter some evil cultivators at the Golden Core or Foundation Establishment stage, like those who harm innocent mortals.
Under safe conditions, occasionally ambushing them for their loot and accumulating merit was quite a good survival strategy.
The more Chen Xun thought about it, the more sense it made. Otherwise, their strength and bandit-like equipment would go to waste.
"Old Ox, I suddenly have a plan." Chen Xun interrupted the big black ox, which was still sorting through the loot, "When we reach the mid-Nascent Soul stage, we should start rooting out the strong and helping the weak!"
"Moo?"
"Damn it, it's for acquiring more loot! How else can we cross the vast Tianduan Plain without milking the cultivation world of Qian Nation dry?!" Chen Xun scolded, "Have you forgotten the Ox Ancestor? The one with tens of thousands of cultivators bowing in worship."
"Moo~~!!" The big black ox's eyes widened in understanding, rubbing against Chen Xun, its good brother.
"Let's go find a safe place and check out the loot first."
"Moo~"
The two figures suddenly sped up, a faint breeze accompanying them, and they vanished without a trace.
