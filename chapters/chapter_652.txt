"My little brother is still family after all, much more obedient than those few back in the sect." Riding the wind, Situ Chen looked out at the sea where red and green hues intertwined, his heart entirely untroubled. Having grown up with Situ Mo, who was always cautious and dutiful, he had no reason to doubt him.
Flying into the air, he headed south, aiming for the renowned Qunyi Strait.
The Qunyi Strait was a stretch of narrow islands of various sizes forming an elongated chain. Situ Chen soared through the air, carried by a fiery black wind, and adjusted his course to take in the sights of the strait from north to south.
As the first large island came into view, a sudden sense of foreboding gripped him. His breathing quickened, and his heart pounded uneasily.
"Rise!" Quickly, he drew a crimson crystalline shield from his storage pouch. Before he had time to fully assess the situation, pain shot through his chest and abdomen. His mana surged as he formed hand seals, causing dense red and black smoke to envelop his body.
Bang!
With a muffled groan, Situ Chen quickly raised the crimson crystal shield in front of him. A resounding clang echoed as the shield was struck, forcefully deflecting it over ten zhang away. He grimaced in pain, withdrawing his hands. A bead of blood slowly welled up between his index and middle fingers, glistening crimson and striking to the eye.
Glancing down at his chest, he noticed a faint stain of scarlet slowly seeping through. The protective armor he wore shimmered faintly, dispersing the golden qi it had just absorbed.
What was that? Situ Chen, as a descendant of the Golden Tang Gate, was an experienced and skilled combatant. Despite being caught off guard, he caught a glimpse of a golden streak and immediately became cautious. Crossing his fingers, he quickly performed a defensive hand seal.
A surge of crimson-black flames erupted from his body, spreading through the air above the sea. The dense smoke obscured the sky and blocked out spiritual senses. Maintaining his composure, Situ Chen thought to himself, This must be some kind of spirit needle or concealed blade. If I block their vision, I can regain the upper hand...
Coming from the Golden Tang Gate, he had some familiarity with similar Dao lineage. Acting decisively, he used the smoke to shield himself. Then, he retrieved a piece of spirit silk from his storage pouch, draping it over his shoulders to conceal his figure entirely.
After taking these precautions, he began to regulate his breathing, but his heartbeat grew erratic again. His chest tightened with dread as he exclaimed, "How can they still see me?!"
All his doubts could only be suppressed, and he once again maneuvered the crystal shield to defend himself. His mind felt hollow, his brows furrowed tightly as he formed another seal with his hands.
Thunk!
This time, although prepared, he felt the impact was even greater than before. A metallic taste rose in his throat as blood pooled there, his eyes widening in shock. At last, he clearly saw the streak of golden light and exclaimed in sudden realization, "An arrow!"
Archers in the Yue State were few and far between. He didn't even need to think before the name popped into his mind, his voice trembling with fear, "It is that lackey of Daoist Master Yuan Su, Li Xuanfeng!"
Although he had never personally crossed paths with Li Xuanfeng, those two arrows were enough to demonstrate the man's skill and terrifying prowess. Cursing aloud, he demanded, "What grudge do I have with him? Why is he trying to kill me?"
A faint numbness spread across his cheeks. Realizing his opponent was charging up another shot, he desperately fled north, all the while surreptitiously pulling a jade pendant from his sleeve and crushing it.
"Fortunately, I planned ahead and left a backup pendant on the island. Sixteenth Brother will surely come to my aid when he sees this. He bears a deep hatred for this man, and together we can finish him off!" Situ Chen had no doubt his brother would come to assist.
He ascended swiftly on the wind, yet his body ached all over. His face darkened as he gripped the twin blades strapped to his back and unsheathed them, crossing them before him for added defense.
A feeling of utter helplessness consumed him. Despite possessing formidable blade skills that rivaled anyone's, he couldn't even locate his attacker. All his abilities in combat and spells were rendered useless, leaving him on the defensive.
As he fled, five streaks of golden light shot toward him from afar, each tailing the other. A cold sweat broke out on his forehead. Known for his lack of defensive skills, a hint of panic crept into his heart. He hastily summoned talisman barriers, their white glows shimmering around him.
Buzz, buzz, buzz…
The hum of arrows vibrated around him. Four of the golden arrows exploded in mid-air, releasing a fine golden mist that not only dispersed his smoke screen but clung stubbornly to his mana like parasitic worms. His body grew heavier by the moment.
The final arrow struck his defensive shield, shattering it into fragments. Desperate, he raised his twin blades. Their crimson glows intertwined as he slashed toward the incoming projectile.
But this arrow was a cun shorter than the others and far more agile. With a sudden twist in mid-air, it streaked between his crossed blades, driving into the gap between his palms. A deep, bloody hole instantly appeared in the center of his hand.
"This arrow…" Dazed and frozen in shock, he finally abandoned all thoughts of resistance. He understood that his opponent was far beyond his ability to counter. Bowing his head, he flew northward. However, weighed down by the astral gold, his speed was noticeably reduced.
More golden arrows chased after him, while he bitterly employed talismans in a futile attempt to keep himself afloat. Li Xuanfeng's attacks were cunning, blending feints with genuine strikes to great effect. Wounded and cornered, he coughed up blood as the pursuit stretched into a full day and night. By now, his body was riddled with injuries, and exhaustion loomed over him.
Situ Mo still has not arrived! It was unclear whether this delay was due to Situ Mo's knack for deception or Situ Chen's inability to discern loyalty from treachery. Even now, he clung to trust in his brother, snarling bitterly, "It seems… Yuan Su's men must have encircled Sixteenth Brother. Fleeing to Golden Sack Island will not necessarily lead to a better outcome..."
Situ Chen had no other options left. On this vast sea, he was being slowly worn down by Li Xuanfeng. Golden Sack Island was his sole hope. After hesitating, he reached into his storage pouch and retrieved a deep golden talisman.
This talisman was a treasure granted exclusively to the main bloodline, far more valuable than ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm talismans. It was an ancient talisman, a trump card for preserving one's life. With the Daoist Masters of the Situ Family long missing and their treasures exhausted, this talisman was one of the few life-saving items left for Situ Chen, the newly instated heir.
Murmuring an incantation, he activated the talisman. A semi-transparent shield slowly materialized around him. Situ Chen exhaled in relief and focused on flying northward, his mind finally at ease despite the arrows still chasing him.
As expected, six or seven more arrows followed in quick succession, striking the barrier but only leaving ripples on its surface. Situ Chen exhaled deeply, a trace of relief flashing across his face. His expression, however, remained dark as he stepped on the gray-red smoke beneath him, continuing his flight northward.
He refrained from uttering any words of retaliation, but the sinister look in his eyes revealed everything. Gripping his twin blades tightly, he pressed forward, his figure cutting through the air with a grim determination.
Situ Chen flew for a while, only to sense Li Xuanfeng's attacks growing increasingly intense. Arrow after arrow pursued him, striking the barrier repeatedly, causing it to ripple with wave after wave of impact. Calculating the distance carefully, Situ Chen silently let out a breath of relief, thinking, "Judging by this, I should at least make it to Golden Sack Island…"
As night deepened, Situ Chen continued flying, his body tense and battered. Suddenly, in the distance, he spotted a man clad in golden armor standing in his path.
The man appeared to be in his fifties or sixties. His eyebrows were as sharp as blades, his sunken eyes a mix of gray and black, and his long white hair flowed with the wind. Despite the lack of emotion on his face, his presence exuded an overwhelming sense of dread.
