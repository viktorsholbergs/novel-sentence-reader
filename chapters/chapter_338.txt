Li Yuanjiao had devoted himself to cultivating on Mount Wutu for a long time and was barely involved in overseeing the clan's affairs now.
The Qi Flow Spirit Swallowing technique had significantly accelerated his speed of cultivation and in just six months, he had already made remarkable progress.
Meanwhile, Xiao Guiluan had returned to her home. She had reached a critical juncture in her cultivation that necessitated her return to the Xiao Family to take the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath before she could learn the rest of her qi cultivation technique.
Li Xizhi, now eight years old, was a late bloomer and barely reached Li Yuanjiao's waist. Clutching a wooden slip, his youthful appearance was evident, marked by a hint of innocence in his brows.
"Father..." Li Xizhi began as he gripped the wooden slip tightly, looking up at his father with puzzled eyes, "Why must I read the Record of Immortal Ascension in the Prefecture? Brother Xicheng has already started spear training, yet I still have to read these strange books all day long…"
Li Yuanjiao patted Li Xizhi's head fondly. He opened his mouth but hesitated for a moment before replying, "Your mother borrowed this book because it details the relationships among the thirty-six peaks of Azure Pond and all the prominent clans… It’s important for you to understand these dynamics so that you can navigate the sect smoothly in the future and avoid unwittingly offending anyone."
Li Xizhi fiddled with the wooden slip, rolling and unrolling it repeatedly, seemingly agitated. After a moment of evident frustration, he looked up again and exclaimed, "Father… You’re really sending me to the Azure Pond Sect…!"
Li Yuanjiao sighed inwardly as he met his child’s mournful gaze.
"Zhi'er… my good boy, the teachings at Azure Pond are profound, and the spiritual qi there is much richer than here by the lake. Your talent is exceptional. In the future, you must cultivate qi within the sect and establish an immortal foundation. You are our family’s hope…"
Li Yuanjiao was never good at comforting children and tears began welling up in Li Xizhi's eyes as he listened to his father. He nodded vigorously, yet was unable to hold back his emotions.
Li Yuanjiao's troubled expression was tinged with guilt. As he pondered on what to do next, a clan soldier approached and respectfully announced, "Young Master, please come home. Young Master Yuanping needs to discuss something important with you!"
Relief washed over Li Yuanjiao. He wiped Li Xizhi’s tears and instructed him in a comforting tone, "Wait for me at the peak. Daddy will return soon."
With these words, he soared into the air, leaving Li Xizhi behind. The boy read his wooden slip for a while longer before tossing it aside in frustration and retreating to his room to sleep.
Li Yuanjiao flew all the way to Lijing Town and descended gracefully into the courtyard where his brother waited. Li Yuanping was examining the jade bracelet, scrutinizing the delicate pattern on its surface. Upon spotting Li Yuanjiao in his black attire, he hurried over to greet him immediately.
"Big Brother! There's news regarding the Heavenly Pure Essence!"
"What?!"
Li Yuanjiao's face lit up with joy instantly as he eagerly pressed for details. However, as Li Yuanping relayed the news, the joy dissipated, his brows knitting together in concern. Taking the jade bracelet, he closed his eyes to concentrate.
His spiritual sense flowed along the pattern on the jade bracelet before entering it, and he could immediately feel a subtle pull from a distance.
After a few moments, he opened his eyes, his expression now filled with doubt.
"The person is still on a mountain nearby..."
Li Yuanping, lacking the spiritual sense to utilize the bracelet, was stunned by Li Yuanjiao's revelation and murmured softly, "It's strange that he still dares to linger nearby after obtaining such precious spirit water…"
"As per the old rogue cultivator, this person was enveloped in mana light. Since he cultivates an authentic technique, he managed to defeat and kill many despite only being at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm… It's likely he's a disciple from an immortal sect!"
Li Yuanping pondered carefully with an uneasy look on his face before responding cautiously, "I wonder what his background and identity is... If he can act this fearlessly, he likely comes from a formidable background and is not an easy opponent to deal with."
Li Yuanjiao remained silent, scrutinizing the jade bracelet in his hand thoughtfully.
"Have you sent someone to investigate that cave already?" Li Yuanjiao asked.
Li Yuanping nodded and confirmed, "I've already sent Uncle Donghe there. He should be returning soon."
As they spoke, Chen Donghe hurried in, his attire impeccable and his sword swaying slightly at his waist. He stopped before the brothers, cupped his fist in respect, and reported, "I've inspected the cave. It’s a mess inside due to the fight. The walls are scarred and the ground is littered with stalactite fragments… Besides that, there wasn't much else to find."
"Thank you, Uncle Donghe," Li Yuanping responded. Chen Donghe nodded and cupped his fist once more, then exited the room.
Turning to his elder brother, Li Yuanping shared his thoughts.
"I was considering exploring the cave myself. With the Heavenly Pure Essence nurtured there, I believe the cave is anything but ordinary…"
Li Yuanjiao ascended a few steps, his gaze fixed on the jade bracelet as he traced the patterns with his thumb thoughtfully. Suddenly, he remarked, "This is too much of a coincidence."
Li Yuanping glanced at his brother, then fell into deep thought.
Li Yuanjiao continued, "Our Old Ancestor always warned us to remain cautious in handling family affairs... This situation reeks of coincidence… This person suddenly came and left, yet he lingers nearby after seizing the spirit water…"
"Brot-..." Li Yuanping began, but Li Yuanjiao raised his hand to cut him off. He performed a series of hand seals and began channeling his true essence.
His River True Essence, clear as turquoise lake water, enveloped the jade bracelet. He then stowed it into his storage pouch, explaining, "Guiluan mentioned numerous secret techniques that can manipulate minds and provoke desires through dharma artifacts… This incident is highly suspicious; we must be cautious."
"Yes. The Heavenly Pure Essence is undeniably tempting... Even I almost acted recklessly. After hearing your explanation, I believe your caution is well-founded," Li Yuanping agreed thoughtfully.
Li Yuanjiao nodded solemnly.
"Our family has ruled this territory for generations. I can believe that we've overlooked the spirit water all this time, but the sudden emergence of this jade bracelet is too convenient to be a mere coincidence."
The brothers' perspective had shifted significantly after the incident where Li Tongya was nearly turned into a sacrifice for the Maha Incarnate. They viewed the world much differently now than they did a year ago.
Li Yuanjiao chuckled wryly, remarking, "The so-called opportunities are often baits. They lure you in with promise, but the hidden traps that await are sharp and deadly…"
He continued, "Now that the old ancestor is gravely injured, I wouldn't have suspected anything if this were any other spirit water… But this is the Heavenly Pure Essence we're talking about."
The two brothers exchanged glances, and Li Yuanping sighed.
"The temptation is just too great... We don't know its true nature. If this is truly an opportunity, it would be regrettable to let it slip by."
"It doesn’t matter," Li Yuanjiao replied with a mysterious smile, then used mana to transmit his voice, "Have you forgotten we still possess an immortal item at home that can see a thousand li ahead, unhindered by any mountain or water body?"
"Ah, yes!"
Li Yuanping suddenly remembered the mirror, a family heirloom invaluable in times of crisis, yet he had momentarily forgotten its capability.
He pounded his fist in his palm excitedly and smiled.
"I'll go retrieve it from the mountain now!"
