Operation Forbidden Grounds Surprise Attack, Commence!
* * *
A narrow valley, located further west, bypassing the Black Kobu Tribe village.
This valley, with cliffs on both sides exposing jet-black bedrock with mysterious marble patterns, is the “forbidden grounds” of the Flying Kobudai clans.
The name of this place, almost forgotten by the Kobudai, is the Dontgo Valley.
In this valley of darkness, where the already scarce sunlight due to the fog is further blocked by the overhanging cliffs, there are almost no signs of life, perhaps due to the terrifying presence emanating from its depths.
There are no berry bushes, and not even a single krill can be found.
This forbidden grounds, Dontgo Valley, is an eerie valley, fitting to be described as the “Valley of Death”.
<<<All forces… Chargeーーー!!!>>>
<<<UOOOOOOOOOHーーー!!!>>>
But today, in this “Valley of Death”…
…The war cries of warriors suddenly echoed!
After a deafening roar that made one want to cover their ears, a large number of Red Kobu and Blue Kobu warriors poured into the valley, breaking through the wall of fog!
The Red and Blue Kobudai Allied Forces!
Despite being unexpectedly attacked by a monster on the way, they finally reached their destination, and launched their surprise attack on the Black Kobu Tribe!
<<<Wh-What!? >>>
<<<Enemy attack! Enemy attack!>>>
<<<Who are you!! You bastaaards!?>>>
Hearing their roars, Black Kobu warriors, in charge of guarding the forbidden grounds, hurriedly emerged from the shadows of the rocks.
They were just taking a break, and are greatly flustered by the sudden turn of events.
Many of them still have turban shell crumbs around their mouths.
Towards them, the large Kobudai leading the warriors… Kobdalian, his body enveloped in blazing red flames created by his supernatural ability… shouted!
<<<I am ‘Kobdalian of the Raging Flames’, the proud Clan Chief of the Red Kobu Tribe! Come at me, Black Kobu! I’ll char your black scales even blackerrrr!!!>>>
And Kobdalian, without a moment’s delay, transformed into a giant ball of flame and charged at the Black Kobu warriors!
<<<Hiih!? H-Hot!? It burns…>>>
<<<Gyaaaーーー!!>>>
The Black Kobu warriors, emerging one after another from the holes dug into the cliff, jumped at Kobdalian, trying to stop him, but they’re no match for him!
Some are burned to ashes by the power of Kobdalian’s supernatural ability, 【Raging Flames】, while others are simply blown away by his giant body!
<<<Seize the glory of the Black Kobu!>>>
<<<Seize the glory of the Black Kobu!>>>
<<<Seize the glory of the… Gyah!?>>>
<<<Hey, hey, hey! Don’t just stare at the Clan Chief, you brats!!>>>
<<<We won’t let the Clan Chief hog all the glory!!>>>
Of course, the other warriors aren’t slacking off either.
Behind Kobdalian, who was clearing the way with his charge, the Red Kobu warriors shouted, and the Blue Kobu warriors, calmly and collectedly… defeated the Black Kobu warriors that Kobdalian missed!
<<<It’s 10 to 1! Attack them 10 to 1ーーー!!>>>
<<<You idiot! We can’t do that in this situation!?>>>
<<<Retreat! Retreat further in!!>>>
The Black Kobu warriors defending the forbidden grounds were completely routed.
They all fled into the depths of the valley in disarray.
Kobdalian, watching their pathetic display, stopped for a moment and snorted.
<<<Hmph.>>>
<<<Oh my, Kobdalian-dono. As a Red Kobu warrior, you don’t like surprise attacks? >>>
The one who spoke to Kobdalian was ‘Kobdacleva, the Wise’, the Clan Chief of the Blue Kobu Tribe.
He had been staying near Kobdalian during the current battle, not participating in the fighting himself.
However, it can be said that the success of this battle is largely due to Kobdacleva’s efforts.
After all, it’s all thanks to the strategy he devised, gathering information, that they were able to approach this forbidden grounds undetected, and launch a surprise attack at a time when the defenses were weak.
<<<I don’t like surprise attacks. But they’re trying to awaken the Calamity. We can’t be picky.>>>
Kobdalian muttered that, keeping his eyes fixed on the depths of the valley, without looking back at Kobdacleva.
(I won’t let Kobdaroze’s sacrifice be in vain! I’ll stop those Black Kobu bastards… myself!! )
Fighting spirit burned in Kobdalian’s eyes.
In sync with that fighting spirit, the flames enveloping him burned even brighter.
<<<I’m glad to hear you say that. This surprise attack is both the main attack and a diversion. Rampage to your heart’s content. That will weaken the defenses of the Black Kobu village, making it easier for the separate unit to rescue the kidnapped children.>>>
Kobdacleva said quietly.
Yes… the Blue Kobu Tribe has to rescue their fry who are being held hostage.
Perhaps because of that, most of this assault force on the forbidden grounds consists of Red Kobu warriors, and only a few Blue Kobu warriors.
<<<Children are treasures. We have to save them.>>>
Kobdalian truly believes that.
Therefore, he had no objection to the troop deployment proposed by Kobdacleva, and readily accepted it.
And there’s also the fact that Red Kobu warriors are eager to fight, so they’re better suited for an assault operation than a somewhat delicate job like rescuing fry…
“…Yes, that’s right. Children are treasures.”
Kobdacleva’s eyes gleamed, agreeing with Kobdalian’s words.
And he too glared at the depths of the valley.
<<<Let’s keep this momentum and head deeper in, Kobdalian-dono! At this time, ‘Kobdarok, the Black Rock’, the Clan Chief of the Black Kobu Tribe, should be at the Calamity excavation site, directing the work!>>>
<<<Yeah… We’ll crush him and put an end to this foolish act! …Let’s go! Warriors!!>>>
<<<UOOOOOOOOOHーーー!!!>>>
Responding to Kobdalian’s command, the Kobudai all roared…
…And once again, they started swimming towards the depths of the valley with incredible speed!
