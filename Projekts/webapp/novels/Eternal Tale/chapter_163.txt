"Upholding the weak and saving innocent civilians, we haven't done that in Qian Nation, right?" Chen Xun boasted and took a sip of tea. "Heh heh, and we even ambushed the sect leader, who is a big shot."
"Moo moo moo~~" The big black ox chuckled, scaring others into thinking they were there to kill.
"And we even went undercover as spies in the Four Symbols Alliance, like real agents." Chen Xun recalled a hint of nostalgia in his eyes. "It was pretty thrilling, not bad."
"Moo~~" The big black ox glanced at him. Back then, he insisted on using secret codes for meetings.
Obviously, it was a legitimate business of trading information, but they left the other cultivators completely confused.
"Sigh, truly a treasure." Chen Xun flipped through the little booklet with a look of delight. "We also fled with the people of various countries, and I think my shoes got ruined during that."
"Moo moo?" The big black ox was startled. It was thought the shoes got damaged while they were running around together.
"Old ox, it's got nothing to do with you." Chen Xun snorted coldly, somewhat exasperated. "Who knows which damned bastard placed a blade on the escape route. Damn it, everyone was fleeing, who would place a tiny blade on the ground? Damn." Chen Xun spat angrily. "Luckily, I have the skills to patch things up and keep wearing them."
"Moo moo moo~~"
The big black ox laughed so hard its belly shook, moving its chair next to Chen Xun to read with him. Memories are always precious when not recorded, and this is why the ox admired Chen Xun the most.
"Old ox, look, I've recorded all the major sects you lost to in formation battles, like the Hundred Ghost Gate, Heaven Mountain Gate, Wind and Thunder Sect..." Chen Xun chuckled lowly, recounting all the history of the big black ox. "I don't know why you were laughing like an idiot."
"Moo?!" The big black ox looked incredulous, suddenly standing up. Chen Xun had recorded this too?
Furious, it wrestled with Chen Xun for the booklet, while Chen Xun's laughter grew more and more arrogant. The big black ox, exasperated, pulled out the booklet recording Chen Xun's exploits, feeling utterly betrayed...
"Damn it!!!" Chen Xun flew into a rage, also standing up abruptly. "Old ox, I need to reason with you."
"Moo?" The big black ox snorted, thinking he was really going to reason with it.
"I..."
Before Chen Xun could finish, Nine Palaces Mountain suddenly shook, and two divine lights shot into the sky, imposing and solemn.
A treasure ship hovered in the sky, and the two figures standing on it exuded an awe-inspiring presence that made people want to bow down, unable to look directly at them.
"Farewell, Ancestor!"
"Farewell, Ancestor!"
The grand voices of women echoed from all the peaks of Nine Palaces Mountain, spreading far and wide, filling the entire mountain range with a cold, fierce aura.
"Damn, Nascent Soul Ancestor!"
"Moo!!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox were shocked, seeing such a powerful figure for the first time, and hurriedly bowed to the sky.
"The Northern Territory has changed, but Nine Palaces Mountain must not be disturbed. Everything remains the same." A majestic voice spread in all directions, devoid of any emotion. "Junior Sister Jin will return soon. Focus on your cultivation."
"We obey the Ancestor's order!"
"We obey the Ancestor's order!"
"Moo!"
Responses echoed from all around Nine Palaces Mountain. Chen Xun and the big black ox also loudly followed along. Even the cook was one of their own.
**Buzz...**
As soon as the words fell, the treasure ship vanished into the sky, its speed making Chen Xun and the big black ox envious. They wanted one too.
They exchanged a silent glance. After a century of waiting, it seemed their chance had finally come.
"Old ox, opportunities come to those who are prepared." Chen Xun quietly transmitted to the big black ox, "But if an immortal is prepared, then every place is full of opportunities!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox's eyes widened, still savoring the aura of the Nascent Soul Ancestor.
"Get ready tonight, we set off for Snow Listening Valley." Chen Xun rubbed his hands together, eyes filled with intense excitement. "We'll leave no stone unturned in investigating the situation there."
"Moo~~!" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun!
"But if their ancestor dares to speak so openly." Chen Xun's lips curled into a playful smile, "It could also be a trap, old ox, be ready to run at any time."
"Moo~" The big black ox didn't think much of it; whatever the big brother says goes.
Meanwhile, atop the mountain peak stood five women, dressed in various shades of smoky gauze skirts, their hands delicate, their skin like creamy jade.
The gentle breeze stirred two strands of hair at their cheeks, adding a touch of alluring charm.
All five gazed into the distance, each with a different expression, but all with a trace of confusion in their eyes.
"Senior Sister, why does the ancestor refuse to reveal the situation in the Northern Territory?"
"Senior Sister, the entire cultivation world is mobilized; could there really be changes in the Northern Territory?"
"Yeah, I heard that Moyu Pavilion has mobilized all their forces, discovering a great opportunity there. But what does this mean now?"
"The cultivators are profit-driven, and news from the Northern Territory is always vague."
After speaking, the four simultaneously looked at Nine Palaces Mountain's senior sister, Jiang Xuechen.
She slowly turned and stepped forward, her skirt flowing like snow and moonlight, making her movements even more graceful and elegant.
Seeing this, the four junior sisters were momentarily dazed, feeling a sense of inferiority rising within them. Jiang Senior Sister's beauty was renowned across the nations, and she possessed heavenly spiritual roots.
"Do not worry, focus on your cultivation." Jiang Xuechen spoke softly, her eyes clear as autumn waters, her whole being exuding a faint radiance, untouched by mortal smoke and dust.
"Yes, Senior Sister." The four women sighed lightly, cupping their hands, and then stepped into the air, leaving a faint fragrance behind.
After they left, Jiang Xuechen stood silently for a long time, the cold wind brushing her face, her hair already frosted. Suddenly, she channeled her magic into her fingertips. A pure white jade slip emerged from her Golden Core, spreading into the sky as her wrist moved gently with her gaze.
Jiang Xuechen's eyes were steady as she began calculating the jade slip. The Northern Territory expedition had begun to show signs.
"Top ten sects, three major forces, the fleeing cultivators, the barbarian cultivators of the Northern Territory..." She murmured continuously.
The overbearing nature of the top ten sects was well known to them; the eastern part of Qian Nation had been sealed off before the Northern Territory expedition.
However, the three major forces had always secretly opposed the top ten sects while appearing to cooperate openly.
The cultivators and spiritual herbs from both sides couldn't circulate, and who knows how many cultivators had died secretly, unnoticed by the public.
But now, it seemed this delicate balance was completely shattered because of the Northern Territory expedition...
Jiang Xuechen's brows furrowed deeper, her eyes showing a hint of shock that was barely noticeable before she flashed and disappeared from the mountaintop.
...
As the sun set and dusk fell, the crescent moon hung like a hook.
On either side of Snow Listening Valley, towering peaks stood steep and rugged, with sheer cliffs rising like they were cut by a knife.
This was a world of white, with snow weighing down the cold branches and wind howling through the forest.
However, the snowflakes drifting around Snow Listening Valley carried a trace of spiritual energy and a coldness that even cultivators could feel.
Outside the valley, female cultivators sat in meditation everywhere, including ten Golden Core stage cultivators, leaving no blind spots. They had entered a special period.
Within the valley, the great formation stood firm, connected to the spiritual veins, continuously emitting abundant spiritual energy.
