【Beautiful Girl Detective Akashiterika!】The Superbad Treasure Theft Case 6
* * *
“First, let’s talk about ‘Teodartes’s Plate’… Akashiterika-sama, Emi-san… Do you know the name Teodartes?”
At Director Rakigataa’s question, Emi shook her head sideways.
“…If I remember correctly, he was the prime minister of the former Yoiyattsu Kingdom, about five hundred years ago?”
Akashiterika, on the other hand, put her hand on her chin, thought for a moment, and retrieved the answer from her memories.
“Correct. Gufufu, as expected of Akashiterika-sama.”
Director Rakigataa smiled, and continued his explanation.
“And Teodartes is more famous as a heavy drinker and gourmand, rather than for his achievements as prime minister. In his later years, he collected various tableware to enhance his meals, but there’s one plate that he bought… but never used. That is…”
“Teodartes’s Plate…”
“Exactly.”
Emi, listening to Director Rakigataa and Akashiterika’s conversation, tilted her head.
“He bought it… but didn’t use it? Why?”
“…It had a hole in it.”
Director Rakigataa, smiling wryly, answered Emi’s question.
“Teodartes, having heard from a merchant that there was a ‘rare plate’, bought it without even seeing the actual item, and it’s said that when he saw the actual plate, with a hole right in the center, he lamented his own foolishness. However… he didn’t discard ‘Teodartes’s Plate’, even though it was defective as a plate.”
“Why?”
“…It was beautiful. Teodartes’s Plate was made of a mysterious material that shines with rainbow colors when exposed to light. Teodartes made the rainbow-colored plate a family heirloom, also as a reminder of his foolish act, and the plate was passed down through his family for generations… but during the dissolution of the Yoiyattsu Kingdom two hundred years ago, his family also died out. Teodartes’s Plate, after changing hands many times, ended up in this Frozend family treasure vault.”
After finishing his explanation of the history of Teodartes’s Plate, Director Rakigataa sighed, lowering his eyebrows, looked at the empty glass case, and continued, as if muttering to himself.
“…Although it’s called ‘Teodartes’s Plate’, its true nature is unknown. We were in the middle of investigating it… and yet, it was stolen. Of course, it’s undoubtedly a valuable treasure in terms of monetary value, but more than that… We might have lost the opportunity to uncover the truth about the relic… That’s what frustrates me the most.”
Saying that, Director Rakigataa closed his eyes sadly, and slumped his shoulders.
“So, what about the ‘Frozend Living Dolls’? What kind of treasure are they?”
But they can’t just stay depressed.
Emi, unfazed by the gloomy atmosphere, asked Director Rakigataa to explain the other treasure.
“…The Frozend Living Dolls are… as the name suggests, life-sized female dolls that were discovered in a hidden room of the Frozend family’s… another mansion, not this one. There were five of them… but their expressions are all different—some look surprised, some look like they’re sleeping. They’re so elaborately made that they look like they’re alive, so they’re called ‘Living Dolls’.”
Director Rakigataa, saying that, glanced at the empty pedestal.
The Living Dolls were probably placed on that pedestal.
“This one too… despite being discovered by the Frozend family, is a mysterious item whose true nature is unknown. First, its history is unknown. Why they were placed in a hidden room, who hid them there… there are no records left. From the clothes the dolls are wearing, it’s assumed that they were probably made four to six hundred years ago, but… Also, these Living Dolls have the astonishing property of being impervious to damage, and their material is still unknown.”
“Life-sized women… That means… they must have been quite large treasures, right?”
“Yes, Akashiterika-sama… All the dolls were of young, beautiful women, between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, so you’re right. Their clothing varies—some are dressed like nobles, some like maids, and some like commoners.”
“…………”
Akashiterika, having taken in the information about the three stolen treasures—the Superbad Jeweled Crown, Teodartes’s Plate, and the Frozend Living Dolls—began to think.
She crossed her arms, fell silent, accelerated her thinking, and organized the information.
“…………”
Beside Akashiterika, who continued to concentrate silently, Emi was also deep in thought.
At first, she had her hand on her forehead, glancing at Akashiterika with a slightly apologetic look.
But then, as if she had noticed something—
She also crossed her arms, and tilted her head.
【Teodartes】
He was briefly mentioned by Herotti at the beginning of Arc 23, and they seem to have been acquainted.
