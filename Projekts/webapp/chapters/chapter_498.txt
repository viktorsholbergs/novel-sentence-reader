Li Yuanjiao had been cultivating on Mount Qingdu for more than half a year now, and though his cultivation had improved, he was still far from breaking through to the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. After all, the Foundation Establishment Realm was unlike the Qi Cultivation Realm; it was common for breakthroughs to take decades.
"Father still hasn't set off… He always worries so much and insists on making sure everything is well before he's willing to leave," Li Yuanjiao murmured to himself with a soft sigh.
Li Xuanxuan has been preparing for more than half a year, yet still has not departed. Li Xijun did not rush him and just waited patiently instead. After all, collecting cold water was not urgent, and pushing too hard on the matter might rouse suspicion.
With Li Qinghong in seclusion and no one else guarding the family, Li Yuanjiao could not afford to immerse himself too deeply in his cultivation. He would occasionally emerge and practice his spells and swordsmanship.
While reading a sword technique manual, he saw Li Wushao descending from the sky, riding the wind and all clad in black.
After Li Wushao had gratefully received the Clear Cloud Elk Fruit from Li Yuanjiao, he consumed it before resuming his cultivation. Two dark shadows had already appeared underneath his black robe. Likely, within a year or so, the two hooks would eventually grow out.
"Family Head, two people landed in front of the mountain. They say they're from the Han Family of Dongliu Island," Li Wushao reported.
Li Yuanjiao was slightly taken aback as he asked, "The Han Family of Dongliu…?"
He had heard of the Han Family before. The Foundation Establishment Realm demon creatures the Li Family used in their rituals now were often captured around Dongliu Island. Li Yuanjiao had also spent some time on the island before.
The Han Family of Dongliu was an old clan, similar to the Yuan Family. They had many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and established a strong presence in the Eastern Sea.
Knowing their reputation, Li Yuanjiao felt it appropriate to receive them personally. He smoothened his clothes and flew out of the cave dwelling.
In the courtyard stood two figures, both Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. The leader was a young cultivator with an unassuming appearance and simply dressed, while behind him stood a tall, broad-shouldered man.
Li Xijun accompanied the young man, smiling and chatting with him amiably. They seemed to be having a pleasant time.
Upon seeing the tough-looking man, Li Yuanjiao quickly understood the situation. He stepped forward, cupping his fist as he introduced himself.
"Li Yuanjiao of Qingdu greets you, fellow Daoist."
The young man's eyes flicked over Li Yuanjiao's face as he responded, "Ah, my apologies for not noticing. I am Han Shizhen of Dongliu, the young master of the Han Family. Greetings, fellow Daoist!"
Li Yuanjiao nodded in acknowledgment and invited them to sit. Han Shizhen smiled warmly and spoke politely.
"A few days ago, my clan uncle fell seriously ill, and my clan brother visited your esteemed family to seek medicine but offended your family in the process. I have come today specifically to apologize. I brought a few small gifts, which I hope you will accept."
He then gestured to the tough-looking man and explained, "My clan brother has always had a bit of a temper. He had spoken rudely due to the urgency of a life-or-death situation… I hope you can forgive him."
It turned out that the tough-looking man was the same Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator who had come to request medicine a few days ago. Back then, his rudeness and arrogance had triggered Li Qinghong.
Now, however, he hung his head and apologized repeatedly.
Since both parties were from prominent clans, they would not hold a grudge over such a minor incident. Li Yuanjiao waved it off, saying simply, "No need to apologize. I understand that you were eager to obtain the medicine. It's no problem."
Han Shizhen then handed over a jade box. Li Yuanjiao gestured for Li Xijun to accept it and then asked, "If I may ask, how's that elder from your esteemed family...?"
"Ah…"
Han Shizhen shook his head slightly and continued, "He didn't make it. Despite taking many life-extending herbs, his injuries were too severe. In the end, his immortal foundation collapsed, and he passed on."
Li Yuanjiao, seeing that the two men were not dressed in white mourning attire, had assumed their elder man had managed to recover and was even ready to offer his congratulations.
Realizing his mistake, he quickly apologized.
"My condolences…"
"It's alright. Though my clan uncle passed, he brought back treasures that are of far greater value to our family than a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. In a way, it was a good thing!" Han Shizhen replied with a soft smile.
Li Yuanjiao and his nephew paused momentarily at this unexpected statement. Sensing their discomfort, Han Shizhen quickly explained, not wanting to make a negative impression on them.
"This is a custom in our Eastern Sea, which may be a little different from those here on the mainland… I apologize if I have caused any discomfort!" he explained hastily.
Li Yuanjiao nodded, understanding that Han Shizhen would not have traveled all this way just to apologize. He waited patiently for his guests to reveal the real purpose of their visit.
Sure enough, after the brief exchange of pleasantries, Han Shizhen got to the point, asking, "How many Wanglin Blossoms does your esteemed family produce each year?"
So, that's what this is about!
Li Yuanjiao immediately grasped the situation. Realizing he held the upper hand in this discussion, he relaxed slightly and answered in a steady tone, "It blooms once every three years, yielding fourteen flowers each time."
"Perfect!" Han Shizhen nodded happily then asked, "How much do you sell this flower for on the mainland?"
Li Yuanjiao had already guessed where this conversation was headed and replied calmly, "The price has risen in recent years—around two Spirit Stones per flower."
"Ah!"
Upon hearing this, Han Shizhen, who had just lifted his jade cup, placed it back down heavily without even tasting a sip of the tea.
"That price is far too low, fellow Daoist! We are talking about a life-saving item here!" he remarked regretfully.
He leaned in, advising, "The mainland is peaceful and prosperous, with no major calamities to speak of. The rogue cultivators may be ignorant, but surely you and I, who belong to prestigious clans, know better. That so-called devil plague is nothing but a farce!"
Han Shizhen continued, "It's just a way for the three sects and seven gates to deal with the inflated price of blood qi by the sects in the Eastern Sect! How can something as precious as Wanglin Blossom be sold in such a bright and peaceful land?"
Bright and peaceful…
Li Yuanjiao's lips twitched at the description but his attention was quickly drawn to Han Shizhen's words. He mused softly, "A way to deal with inflated prices..."
Han Shizhen sighed deeply.
"Exactly! In recent years, the demand from overseas demons for sustenance has surged, driving up the prices of blood qi, resentment qi, souls, spirit, and water. The Eastern Sea cultivators barely have enough to use themselves, how could we possibly afford to export these resources to the mainland?
"So the three sects and seven gates loosened their control over the seaports, allowing rogue cultivators from overseas to enter. They then orchestrated the so-called devil plague—using their high-level devil cultivators to slaughter mortals and rogue cultivators alike. This allowed them to eliminate opposition, consolidate their power, and still reap their rewards."
As Han Shizhen spoke animatedly, he discreetly watched for any changes in Li Yuanjiao's expression. Li Yuanjiao simply sipped his tea and nodded along, listening carefully.
"In this way, the sects feast, the clans sip the soup, and they maintain the moral high ground. I've heard that such righteousness is highly valued on the mainland…" Han Shizhen chuckled before adding with a playful grin, "Your esteemed family must have consumed quite a few devil cultivators over the years, right? I hear everyone earned a lot; even an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator was worth more than ten Spirit Stones… We're truly envious!"
"We've indeed killed a few devil cultivators," Li Yuanjiao replied with a small smile.
Han Shizhen glanced at Li Xijun, noting that the young man was also nodding and smiling, looking even more natural than Li Yuanjiao.
This confirmed Han Shizhen's suspicions.
The Li Family must have some serious backing in Azure Pond. Li Yuanjiao is difficult to read, but Li Xijun is young and clearly knows more than he lets on.
With renewed enthusiasm, Han Shizhen continued, "That's exactly what I mean! The spiritual energy in your region is concentrated in those immortal mountains, while the rest of the land is filled with mortals… How many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators could there possibly be? How many are truly fighting to the death? You should really consider exporting these Wanglin Blossoms to the Eastern Sea!"
