The End of the Great Grassland of Beginnings 1
* * *
Zu, zuun…
The ground rumbled in the depths of the Great Grassland of Beginnings.
It’s the sound of the Grand Armored Yumushi’s giant body—split in two—falling to the ground.
Other than that, it was a completely silent night.
The insects must have fled somewhere, because of the monster’s rampage.
The only things illuminating the silent grassland are the stars and the moon.
It’s been a while since it was illuminated by purple and gold.
The surroundings are dim.
And suddenly, in that silent world—
Another sound echoed.
Guuuuuuuuuーーー!!!
…That’s the sound of Emi’s stomach.
Again, she has only eaten twenty small rabbits today.
Her stomach, a growing girl’s, won’t be satisfied with that.
Emi, who had been clinging to the Grand Armored Yumushi until right before it was cut in half, was closest to it.
So she immediately jumped onto the severed part of the Grand Armored Yumushi, which was still twitching, and silently bit into it, starting to eat.
And like an insect devouring fruit, she dug a hole in the flesh, burrowed in, and disappeared from sight.
“Alrightーーー!!”
“We wonーーー!!”
“We did itーーー!!”
On the other hand, Googydan, Googyden, and Googydon, the triplets, who had been hiding in the tunnel they dug underground, jumped out, their joy exploding.
“Ah! Where’s Anego!?”
“Where did she go, Anego!?”
“Anego!? Anego!?”
But then, they immediately turned on their magic lamp headlights, illuminating the area, looking for Saint Ad.
“Ah! There she is, Anegoーーー!!”
“Are you okay, Anegoーーー!?”
“Anego!? Anego!? Uoooooooohーーー!?”
And then, finding Saint Ad, collapsed face down on the ground, they rushed over to her, panicking, and started shaking her.
“U-Ugh, you’re so noisy, you idiotsーーー! Be quiet… Gah…”
“Ow!?”
“Guh!?”
“Gah!?”
Saint Ad, barely breathing, hit them with her 【Barrier・Small Mallets】.
“…………”
Shimegamamo was silent, sensing the commotion behind her.
Silently, she stood there, her large cleaver, now completely free of vines and other plants, and back to its original state, stuck in the ground.
Her gaze is on her hands.
They’re completely covered in moss, up to her elbows.
It almost looks like she’s wearing fluffy, green gloves… almost.
But… that’s not it.
To be precise, it’s not that her hands are ‘covered in moss’—
Her hands…
“Are you alright…?”
Shimegamamo, hearing that voice, turned around.
There stood Kalamaruyu, approaching her with a lantern, illuminating the surroundings, with a serious expression on his face.
“…………”
Seeing his face, Shimegamamo let out a small, relieved sigh, so small that no one else could notice.
That’s right, a sigh of relief.
To Shimegamamo, her clan’s rules are, in principle, the most important rules to follow.
But lately, she’s been trying to protect something more than that.
And that is…
“““UWAAAAAAAAHーーー!?”””
…It was at that moment!
The three brothers suddenly screamed, having found something!
As Shimegamamo looked around, she quickly found the ‘abnormality’.
Around the Grand Armored Yumushi, which should be dead…
Large and small pieces of Kodorokizo ore were floating.
Like right before firing 【Magic Ore Bullets】!
…Simply put, it’s a death throe.
But a magical one.
The vast mana dwelling within the Grand Armored Yumushi’s body—
Part of it—
Has gone out of control, causing the 【Magic Ore Bullets】 to go haywire!
DAGAGAGAGAGA!!
And the next moment, the haywire 【Magic Ore Bullets】 were naturally fired in all directions!
Saint Ad, protected by the earthen wall that the triplets had quickly created with magic, was safe.
But.
…Shimegamamo and Kalamaruyu are completely exposed!
“Uoooooooohーーー!!!”
Shimegamamo immediately rushed forward, stood in front of Kalamaruyu, and became his shield.
DOS… DOS-DOS… DOS!!
Kalamaruyu, who had shrunk back in fear, opened his eyes, and—
What he saw was Shimegamamo’s back, her arms spread wide, protecting him.
“H-Hey!? A-…”
Are you okay!?
Before Kalamaruyu could ask that… Shimegamamo fell backwards, with a thud.
Countless 【Magic Ore Bullets】 are stuck in her body.
Her right arm is missing, from the elbow down.
And above all.
In her chest—
A giant piece of Kodorokizo ore is embedded there, creating a huge… hole.
