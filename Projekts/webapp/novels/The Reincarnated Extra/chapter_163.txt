【Musings on Ardyst】 “The Phantom Country” of Saryunas
* * *
Have you heard of the country called “Saryunas” before?
Saryunas was once a small country said to have existed on the “Golden Continent” of Hamejika.
Abundant in magic ore deposits, it accumulated wealth by exporting them to other nations and boasted prosperity. However, it was an undeniably small nation in scale.
Even if students just starting to study history are unfamiliar with this country’s name, I believe there is no shame in that, as the author.
And yet, this Saryunas was also quite famous among those who love the wondrous and the unknown… In a certain far-off land, such people are called “occult maniacs,” but they referred to that country thusly:
….The “Phantom Country” of Saryunas.
* * *
Now then, this country of Saryunas existed within a basin (called the Saryunas Basin after the country’s name) surrounded by the Ranrananga Mountains, one of Hamejika Continent’s magic boundaries.
As mentioned earlier, due to trading magic ores with other nations, human interaction with surrounding regions was quite lively despite its location within the mountains.
However, at a certain point, an anomaly occurred in Saryunas.
The most famous historical record detailing this anomaly is the diary of Sasan Rassharn, the founding chairman of the Rassharn Company.
In his youth, he was a merchant who amassed a fortune through trade with Saryunas.
Here is an excerpt from that diary:
“[Omitted from beginning]…And just as the elegant Saryunas townscape began coming into view after crossing over the mountain pass, that haze began to drift in.
A pure white haze.
At first, I paid it no mind, thinking it was just an ordinary haze.
But something seemed amiss.
No matter how far we proceeded into the haze, we could not reach Saryunas.
Getting stranded in this winter season could mean life or death.
I instructed the caravan to turn back the way we came.
But then, strangely enough, despite having traveled quite far into the haze, we arrived back at the mountain pass bordering the country in just a few minutes of backtracking.
Something ominous was clearly occurring.
Convinced of this, I had us retreat entirely from the Ranrananga Mountains…”
Similar accounts exist in other records, commonly describing the phenomenon of “Saryunas being entirely enveloped in a white haze, making it impossible to reach the town no matter how far one advanced into the haze.”
The surrounding nations of that time were concerned by this situation and dispatched investigation teams.
However, they seemed unable to comprehend what this phenomenon was.
A solution was unclear as well.
It appeared they at least realized this white haze was some kind of magical barrier, but they had no idea how to dispel it.
Moreover, the Ranrananga Mountains where Saryunas resided were a magic boundary.
Suffering attacks from the Ranrananga White Lizard hordes and the “Mountain Lord” Golden Bear Gaharingki, the investigation teams of each nation incurred considerable losses.
On top of that, with the opening of the Zakzak Mines in the Kingdom of Teenidys providing an alternative magic ore supply source to rely on instead of Saryunas, the nations withdrew their investigation teams within a few years.
The adventurer’s guild also showed no proactive interest in Saryunas from the start.
Despite being called “adventurers,” what they sought was value over the unknown.
In other words, since involving themselves with that unknown wouldn’t lead to money, Saryunas held no appeal as a subject for the adventurers.
And so, within just a few years’ time, hardly anyone approached Saryunas any longer.
Just what had happened to Saryunas?
What became of the people enveloped within that haze?
These mysteries went entirely unsolved and abandoned, the truth concealed within that pure white haze.
As time flowed on, the number of people knowledgeable about Saryunas gradually dwindled, to the point that debates now arise 300 years later questioning whether a country called Saryunas ever truly existed at all.
Time and the haze had transformed Saryunas into a “Phantom Country.”
* * *
Incidentally, regarding the aforementioned debate of “Did Saryunas really exist?” – to even engage in such a discussion is utter nonsense.
The existence of Saryunas is backed by numerous literature sources, leaving no room for doubt.
Furthermore, researchers from the Somatoko Academy in the “Fantasy Continent” have recently conducted large-scale investigations after voyaging across the sea.
As a result, the basin where Saryunas was said to have existed apparently contains ruins like roads and building foundations.
And even more intriguing than those ruins, something else was also discovered:
….The white haze.
The white haze that once enveloped all of Saryunas, blocking Sasan and others from entry, still persists within that basin – concentrated solely in its central area.
It is unclear what would happen if one approached the current haze.
As the Holy Maiden Consortium frequently cautions, magical barriers degrade in function over time, which is common knowledge.
That white haze, which once merely prevented entry into the country, may have altered its function due to age-related degradation, potentially leading to unforeseen circumstances.
For such reasons, the Somatoko Academy investigation team apparently did not attempt to enter the haze – a prudent judgment, one would think.

Well then, I have provided an introduction to the country of Saryunas this time. How was it?
The “Phantom Country.”
Just hearing that title conjures a sense of romantic wonder.
However, I cannot recommend actually attempting to visit the site.
For the Saryunas Basin is a hazardous magic boundary zone.
Unlike 300 years ago when the roads were relatively developed, one would have to blaze their own trail, defeating monsters obstructing the way.
Without preparing a large-scale investigation team like Somatoko Academy, even approaching would be difficult.
Particularly inadvisable is nearing it during winter.
The snow-laden, high-altitude Saryunas Basin carries high risks of becoming stranded.
Furthermore, the ferocious, blood-starved Ranrananga White Lizards will be lying in wait for your arrival.
It is the kind of place where no number of lives would be sufficient.
You may even get caught in a blizzard, inexplicably finding yourself enveloped by the white haze before you know it.
And then…then what would happen, I wonder?
Would it simply prevent you from advancing further, as the legends state?
Or…might some other phenomenon occur?
I don’t know.
The unknown is frightening.
Romance only feels romantic when experienced secondhand.
At least for a coward like me.
