In the temple they visited, the monks there all preached their own Buddha, eager for everything to belong to them. This objective perspective was something they'd never heard before.
Little Red was still shaking its head, not understanding. It simply did what it needed to do, and its two companions were already deeply immersed. If there were any danger, it would be the first to alert them!
"The Five Ancient Immortal Sects of Great Li Realm occupy the Thunder Pool of Tianshan, specializing in lightning techniques, seeking to communicate with the heavens and earth and to comprehend the profound mysteries of the Dao."
The monk’s robe moved without wind, yet it seemed completely natural. "A cultivator practices self-cultivation, cultivates the heart, and also cultivates virtue."
"Monk, do you also dabble in Daoist cultivation?"
"This old monk only knows a little; there's no need for you to take it seriously," the monk explained with a smile. "You are not a Buddhist practitioner, so I won’t speak much on Buddhist matters."
Chen Xun and the big black ox both sighed deeply, a trace of gloom in their eyes. Perhaps only by viewing things from a truly objective standpoint could they come to believe even a little in their hearts.
"Monk, may we stay a few more days at Chan Yin Temple?" Chen Xun’s eyes showed respect for the monk's knowledge and insight. "I still have many questions in my heart."
"Moo~~" The big black ox swished its tail a few times, with a pleading look in its eyes.
They wanted to slowly digest these teachings, hoping to gain some insights. Even if the person preaching was a mortal, or maybe just a Foundation Establishment or Golden Core cultivator, it would be worthwhile.
But upon closer thought... The teacher of the immortal might be these ordinary people, and finding the shining points in everyone is what gives meaning to the journey.
"The three benefactors are welcome to stay as long as you like. Chan Yin Temple has no restrictions," the monk nodded gently, then turned and called out, "Fan Wang."
"Master," a voice answered before the person appeared.
At that moment, a monk in a blue robe slowly walked in from the side hall. His body was extraordinarily tall and burly, bald, and with a somewhat dull expression, looking very much like a martial monk.
What was even stranger was that in broad daylight, he was carrying a lantern, though it was unclear what he was trying to illuminate.
Little Red lay flat on the ground, feeling a chill. Why was this mid-Golden Core Buddhist disciple calling a low-Golden Core monk ‘master’?
"These are the three benefactors; Fan Wang is my eldest disciple."
"Greetings, benefactors," Fan Wang placed one hand on his chest and bowed in greeting.
"So, you're the monk's eldest disciple."
"Moo~~"
Rustle~~ Little Red kicked up some dust as a response.
"If the three of you have any doubts, feel free to come to the main hall. This old monk believes in fate."
"Heh, we believe in fate too," Chen Xun said with a meaningful smile. "Then we won’t disturb the monk’s meditation any longer."
"Three benefactors, please follow me," Fan Wang, still holding his lantern, led the way.
The temple was old and worn, but large. However, it hadn't been inhabited for a long time.
As Chen Xun walked, he observed the surroundings and asked, "Master Fan Wang, I’ve noticed other temples are thriving with incense offerings. Why is Chan Yin Temple so desolate?"
"Moo?" The big black ox was equally curious but didn’t want to ask in front of the monk.
Little Red squinted its eyes into a thin line, already imagining thousands of possible outcomes, but for now, nothing seemed out of place.
"You can simply call me Fan Wang. I’m not worthy of the title of ‘master’," Fan Wang stopped and turned, his expression blank. "My master does not worship the Buddha, and we are suppressed by other Buddhist sects, which is why Chan Yin Temple has few visitors."
"Why not worship the Buddha?"
"Master believes the Buddha should not be worshipped in temples and that Buddhist cultivation should not be confined to reciting sutras in temples while seeking incense offerings," Fan Wang replied with a blank face. "He also finds it absurd that different Buddhist sects worship different Buddhas."
What?!
Chen Xun and the big black ox both blinked in surprise. This was such a radical and unconventional idea. If this were the mortal world, it would be a crime worthy of execution!
"I see," Chen Xun awkwardly smiled. "We’ll just stay in the mountains; no need to trouble you with preparing rooms for us."
Fan Wang nodded woodenly, "Very well."
"Senior Brother!" A young man with a noble aura walked over with large strides. Dressed in wide robes with a stylish fringe, he looked every bit like a noble scion. He laughed heartily, clearly very open and friendly, and cupped his hands in greeting, "Jiang Zhaocheng greets fellow Daoists!"
Jiang? Chen Xun raised an eyebrow as if recalling something. This person’s overly familiar manner seemed nothing like a Buddhist monk.
"Chen Xun greets fellow Daoists," Chen Xun cupped his hands but didn’t say much more.
The big black ox gave Jiang Zhaocheng a couple of extra glances. He was only at the early Golden Core stage, but he exuded confidence like a Nascent Soul ancestor.
Little Red, meanwhile, was ignoring everything happening outside and was focused solely on observing its surroundings. Wherever the big black ox moved, it followed.
"Daoist Chen, being allowed to stay by our master is no small feat!" Jiang Zhaocheng, full of joy, walked over to them and said, "If Master takes you in, you’ll be our sixth junior brother!"
"Daoist Jiang, I think there’s a misunderstanding..."
"Huh?"
"We are merely borrowing shelter, thanks to the monk's kindness, for a few days," Chen Xun shook his head with a chuckle. "We are not fated for Buddhist cultivation."
"A thousand paths all lead to the same destination. We are all cultivators, I..."
"Second Junior Brother, these three benefactors are guests of our master. Do not bother them too much," Fan Wang interrupted Jiang Zhaocheng’s chatter, "If it is meant to be, the Buddha will see it. There is no need to force things."
Jiang Zhaocheng rolled his eyes at Fan Wang and sighed inwardly. Hmph, Chan Yin Temple has no Buddha! How could he see anything?
"Then we’ll just find a mountain to settle on," Chen Xun cupped his hands in farewell and, together with the big black ox and Little Red, walked towards a forest outside the temple, where there were many crane spirit trees, making it a suitable place to live.
Jiang Zhaocheng watched their departing figures with amusement, craning his neck for a better view.
