Li Xizhi began, "Every region has its own spiritual energy profile. Currently, Yue State is under a Profound Balance Atmosphere, which is inherently fragile. It was painstakingly adjusted by the master cultivator of Yue Cultivating Sect, using Chi Wei and Chu Yi as anchors, to create the perfect conditions for Yue Cultivating Sect's Shangyuan Sword Immortal to achieve their breakthrough."
"This Profound Balance Atmosphere was already fragile, and with the influence of the grotto heaven and the Converging Water Dragon Clan, it is now teetering on the edge of collapse. If this spirit rain continues unchecked, it may completely erode the balance."
Li Xuanxuan furrowed his brow and said, "If that is the case, Yue Cultivating Sect will not sit idly by."
"I believe Yue Cultivating Sect has already sensed that something is amiss." Li Xizhi nodded and continued, "There are bound to be major events in the future. The family must act prudently, aligning its actions with the situation."
"Understood." Both Li Xuanxuan and his grandson nodded in agreement. Even Li Ximing, who was usually lighthearted, wore a rare look of seriousness.
Seeing their understanding, Li Xizhi said, "The Eastern Sea's convergence of water and thunder is the perfect opportunity for Aunt to hold her position. Grandfather, could you prepare a map of Zongquan Island for me? I plan to visit it when I have time."
Li Xuanxuan, of course, provided him with the map. With no reason to linger, Li Xizhi discussed the matter carefully with his wife before turning back and saying, "Xiao'er, stay here and spend time with Huai'er. I will be on my way first!"
Li Xuanxuan quickly pulled him aside and used a sound-transmitting technique to say, "Find a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic beast... and do not forget to receive the talisman!"
Li Xizhi nodded.
After sending Li Xizhi off from Moongaze Lake, Li Xuanxuan and Li Ximing felt a sense of relief. Together, they descended onto the peak. Li Ximing said, "With people in the sect, the information flow is reliable, and preparations are always in place. But, over these years of cultivating in the immortal sect, Brother has certainly gained an air of refined immortality."
Li Xuanxuan shook his head and said, "It is not easy in the sect either. Zhi'er is the most outstanding of your generation. If he had not gone to the sect, your younger brother would not have had to work so hard."
Li Ximing paused, his expression turning to one of slight embarrassment. He sighed and said, "Grandfather, when you say that, I can only feel ashamed..."
Li Xuanxuan waved a hand dismissively. The old man stroked his white beard, patting Li Ximing gently on the back, and said softly, "Each of you brothers is doing your best. You…"
A nostalgic expression crossed his face as he lowered his voice and said, "When I was young, my brothers and elders were either brilliant and sharp, steady and composed, or courageous and strong. When I was given the main seat, I always carried a deep sense of guilt in my heart... It was not until I grew older and experienced more of life that I realized it was not because I was weak or incapable."
The old man paused for a moment before laughing and continuing, "It was because they were too extraordinary. If you, Li Ximing, were in another family, there is no telling—you might have been one of the central figures."
Li Ximing shook the golden sleeves of his robe and chuckled, shaking his head in response. He said, "When I met Granduncle, I thought he was a man of unparalleled might. Armored in war gear, his gaze fierce like that of a tiger or wolf—an unparalleled and fearsome figure! I have never encountered anyone like him. Yet, I heard people say he was still no match for the ancestor, who slew the Maha and subdued the Fei and Yu families."
"Whenever I think about it, I can hardly believe such people exist. In my lifetime, I wonder how long it will take to meet such figures again." Li Ximing reflected.
Li Xuanxuan laughed heartily, a rare sense of boldness filling his voice as he declared, "You may end up waiting an entire lifetime!"
Mount Lijing.
Li Chengliao hurried out of the main hall after handling family affairs. By now, the sun was gradually setting.
As head of the Clan Affairs Courtyard, he didn't deal with much on a daily basis. For someone at the Qi Cultivation Realm, there was no need to spend years in seclusion. The matters he attended to could be resolved in moments, with a few notes and signatures already completing the day's work.
Li Chengliao's natural aptitude was decent compared to others, but it fell far short when compared to the exceptional talents of the Xi and Yue generation. He wasn't far off from his father's abilities, with only a slim hope of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. As such, he wasn't in a rush to cultivate.
For Li Chengliao, cultivation wasn't a lifelong pursuit. It was merely a tool for governance. Instead of spending days in seclusion, he preferred teaching children or chatting with his wife.
Upon entering his family estate, he immediately heard voices from the inner room. Walking in, he found his father, Li Xicheng, dressed in fine robes and seated at the writing desk.
Across from him sat a little boy, barely two years old, carefully arranging several jade rods on the desk in front of him with great focus.
"Father!" Li Chengliao greeted him. Li Xicheng smiled, waved him over, and pointed at the little boy.
The child's features had not yet fully developed, his face round and soft, with eyes like amber gold. Hearing the movement, he looked up at Li Chengliao and called out softly, "Dad."
Li Chengliao nodded, watching as the boy arranged the jade rods into a neat row of six on the desk. Quietly observing, he then heard Li Xicheng speak in a low tone, saying, "Your uncle returned briefly but left in a rush. I was in seclusion at the time and did not hear the news."
"Uncle Xizhi..." Li Chengliao suddenly realized something.
Then he heard his father, Li Xicheng, ponder aloud, "What he means is... there is no need to keep up appearances with the Yu Family anymore. The sooner they are dismantled, the fewer complications there will be."
Li Chengliao nodded slightly. The father and son exchanged a glance before Li Chengliao smiled and said, "Then let us dissolve them. Leave it to me."
Li Xicheng held a teacup in his hand, gently placing it on the desk. He asked, "Do you have a way? Ideally, it should leave no trace."
Li Chengliao sipped his tea and replied, "That is easy. These people are poorly informed. They likely would not even believe Yu Muxian is dead unless someone made it clear. And with a few clan elders sealing off the news… all we need to do is let the truth come to light."
He called out, and soon a Jade Court Guard came forward. Li Chengliao gave his instructions, "Fetch the Six-Stone Cloud Plate from the treasury and summon Elder An."
An Zheyan arrived swiftly. The elder, now more serene and gentle in his old age, cupped his fist and responded with great courtesy.
Li Chengliao took the battered spirit artifact from the hands of a guard nearby and said softly, "Elder, I would like you to take some people to the Yu Family. Tell them that the Yu Family conspired against our ancestor in years past, and that Yu Muxian's death is merely karmic retribution. But since he was still considered a heroic figure, send this spirit artifact as a burial offering for his remains so they will not be left to scatter."
He paused, worried that An Zheyan might not fully understand his intent. Giving him a meaningful glance, he added in a low voice, "Make this move a grand one. The Hooked Serpent is still in the lake and has not gone into seclusion yet. Bring him along with you. With a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator supporting you, there is no need to fear anything unexpected."
An Zheyan nodded in appreciation, taking the spirit artifact before leading a large force of Jade Court Guards to carry out the order.
Li Chengliao then called another individual forward and instructed, "Tomorrow, ensure that those Yu Family relatives on the eastern bank—those who have secretly allied with us—rise up in unison and sever all ties with the Yu Family."
Li Xicheng quietly nodded from the side, while little Li Zhouwei lifted his head to look at his father, his gaze full of affection.
Li Chengliao summoned yet another person and commanded, "When deploying the Jade Court Guards, make the display as loud as possible. Let the people under Master Lu see everything clearly."
The person he summoned was Dou Yi, now an elderly man himself. Dou Yi nodded quickly and departed.
Li Chengliao spoke in a low voice, "That Master Lu, who harmed Yu Mugao, seems to have privately contacted our family several times. Yet we have kept our distance and have not responded. He is a clever man—if he gets wind of this, he will know how to act accordingly."
"In this way, even if anything happens later—if Yu Muxian's supporters were to lose their minds and come to cause trouble—no matter how hard they try to use soul-searching techniques, they will not be able to pin anything on us!" He gently picked up Li Zhouwei, cradling the boy with a smile and saying, "This, my son, is what is called… an open strategy."
Li Zhouwei blinked his golden eyes and leaned against his father's chest, mumbling the two words softly to himself.
