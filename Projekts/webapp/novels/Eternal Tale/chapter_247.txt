"Indeed." Chen Xun’s tone softened. Though there was some risk, the benefits were incredibly enticing—teleportation array schematics were unobtainable in The Great Li Realm, as they were controlled solely by the major powers.
Without the natural barrier of the Forbidden Sea, it would likely take years to obtain such things.
"Senior, do you have the Boundless Ancient Vine or the Earthquake Demon Spirit Essence?" Yu Chen looked at Chen Xun with hopeful eyes. These were treasures from the Forbidden Sea, even rarer than those in secret realms. "Our Yu family has a great need for these two items and is willing to trade anything."
"I do." Chen Xun nodded. After a hundred years of scouring the Forbidden Sea, they had gathered quite a number of treasures from the relics, "Let's start the trade."
"Wonderful!" Yu Chen clasped his hands with excitement, spreading various physical cultivation techniques in the air. These were far from common. "Senior, here is a demonstration of my sincerity."
"The Western Sea Profound Art, the Falling Jade Meridian Transformation Art, and the Trapping God Golden Jade Monument-Breaking Art..." Chen Xun’s eyes widened slightly, reading each title aloud, "Very nice. These are exactly what I need."
"Senior, this is the fourth layer of the Water Spirit Art. The fifth layer is something only my second uncle can discuss with you," Yu Chen presented it respectfully, feeling a surge of excitement. "As for the method to create god-killing artifacts, once my position rises, I’ll surely obtain it for you."
"Good, that’s thoughtful." Chen Xun smiled faintly. Although he had come across some physical cultivation techniques over the last century of treasure hunting, there weren’t many, and not nearly as comprehensive as what Yu Chen had brought.
As time passed, they continued negotiating prices. Chen Xun kept things fair, evaluating each item carefully.
Yu Chen, too, was very honest, avoiding any price inflation and even reducing costs where possible. It wasn’t just a one-time deal; building goodwill with this senior was his priority.
Above the fleet and the great ship, Long Guanzi refrained from any further inspection, instead silently crushing a jade pendant engraved with intricate law patterns.
Several figures on the fleet quietly withdrew behind the main group, and the sea behind them began to stir gently. A terrifying power was silently brewing, seemingly awaiting something.
No one else noticed anything unusual except the old man in blue, Uncle Chu, who sensed an odd disturbance in the air—it was the Yu family’s unique secret technique, Descent of the Divine!
An hour later, Yu Chen stepped down from the great ship, visibly delighted, as Chen Xun watched him with a meaningful look.
Breaking through the mist, Yu Chen called out loudly, "Second Uncle, my transaction with the three seniors is complete, but we still need you to negotiate regarding the Water Spirit Art and the god-killing artifact."
"Very good." Long Guanzi nodded with his hands clasped behind his back, looking up at the dim sky. He could sense his true form about to descend. "You may go now."
"Yes." Yu Chen’s expression turned calm again. With these resources in hand, he could avoid a century’s worth of struggle compared to his peers—and this was just the first trade.
A small smile played at the corners of Long Guanzi’s mouth. These were trivial profits; it was the identity of these three that intrigued him the most.
If they could traverse the Forbidden Sea with such ease, they could be of immense value to the Yu family, unlocking the sea’s secrets. Even if it costs a steep price, it would be worth it.
From their brief clash earlier, he was certain they weren’t at the Nascent Soul stage.
His intentions were now crystal clear—to forcibly subdue these three mysterious cultivators and make them reveal the secrets of the Forbidden Sea!
"Daoist friend, may we have a conversation now?" Long Guanzi wore a friendly expression, his hands still clasped in respect. "I represent the Yu family, and whatever you desire, the Yu family can provide."
He narrowed his eyes, looking into the hazy mist. The great ship had yet to depart, but no sound came from within, leaving him to wonder what they might be waiting for.
Long Guanzi maintained his respectful posture, showing no sign of impatience. Such eccentric cultivators likely felt slighted by his earlier misstep and were letting him stew. Internally, he scoffed; he’d long outgrown such petty tactics back when he was still at the Golden Core stage.
An incense stick’s time later, his brows knitted. The great ship remained anchored in the depths of the mist, without any movement.
"If my friend refuses to respond, I’ll just invite myself in," he declared his aura sharpening. His voice echoed with force across the seas, stirring waves in all directions as a surge of fierce spiritual power gathered in the sky above.
Rumble! Crash!
The sky split open with a tremendous hole, forming a whirlpool. A beam of power radiated down, enveloping Long Guanzi.
An ethereal figure appeared above the heavens, radiating an overwhelming aura, looking upon the world’s cultivators with domineering disregard. It began merging with Long Guanzi’s body, creating a terrifying spectacle.
"Greetings, Ancestor!"
"Greetings, Ancestor!"
Onboard the vast fleet, everyone bowed deeply, not daring to look up, bent beneath the oppressive force. Cold sweat dripped from them like rain.
Yu Chen wavered, barely able to stay upright, his eyes wide with shock—he’d been out-maneuvered by his own family’s ancestor...
Long Guanzi stepped out of the radiant pillar, radiating an awe-inspiring force that shook the surroundings, causing the mist to disperse.
His presence was vast and chilling, his gaze piercingly dark, focused directly on the distant great ship.
Sizzle! Crack!
An endless god-killing force enveloped the area, creating vortexes in the midst of the Forbidden Sea, tearing it apart. However, the silhouette of the great ship within was also fragmenting.
"An illusion array? Impossible…"
Long Guanzi’s eyes gleamed with interest—they’d fled long ago. "This power isn’t spiritual; it’s closer to the Five Elements. So, there’s a master of formations on that ship."
"Haha! Such audacity."
Long Guanzi laughed aloud, his laughter shaking the darkened sea, where massive waves roared and crashed around them. High waves battered the fleet, soaking many cultivators, yet they dared not resist with their spiritual power, for the ancestor was furious.
The cultivators were stunned—the great ship had silently… fled?!
"Return," Long Guanzi commanded, scanning the surroundings. No trace remained. "Yu Chen, find them."
"Ancestor, I—" Yu Chen began, but stopped as the communication jade in his sleeve slowly shattered, dissolving into the Five Elements and returning to the world.
"Hmph."
Anger flashed in Long Guanzi’s eyes—he’d been played. Such cautious cultivators.
Buzz—
Buzz—
The vast fleet began its return, and the whirlpool in the sky once again shone with a radiant pillar. The ethereal shadow within Long Guanzi was drawn back into the vortex.
Only after the ancestor departed did everyone breathe a sigh of relief. The pressure had been unbearable; it was something ordinary people could hardly withstand.
Yu Chen lowered his head, shadows covering his face as his chest rose and fell heavily. Before the family, his personal gains meant nothing; no one would care.
Uncle Chu stepped forward, noticing his young master’s discomfort. But his words caught in his throat, unwilling to speak about the family’s ancient ancestor.
