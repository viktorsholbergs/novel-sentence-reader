The flesh and bones in the air swiftly condensed into chains, binding the limbs of the black-robed cultivator. Below, Jiang Yan completed the final hand seals of his spell. The cultivator was already in a state of shock and despair, watching as the black serpent slithered around his neck.
"Senior, since you know I am from Mount Wu and are aware of many secrets, you should also know that even if I cannot defeat you, I have plenty of ways to take you down with me!" he yelled threateningly.
With a resolute expression, the cultivator glared at the approaching black serpent. The serpent flicked its tongue and let out a cold laugh, taunting, "Why not give it a try?"
The black-robed cultivator's eyes widened in sudden realization, and he exclaimed, "This is... Blood Drinker! How is this possible?!... You!"
Strange, dark red mana lights began to rise from his body, obediently flowing toward Jiang Boqing, dancing and swirling around the serpent.
"Why is it impossible?" Jiang Boqing continued taunting as he flicked his tongue, his hissing voice calming down as he said lightly, "I, too, once sought the Supreme Shaman's Three Nine Blood Essence. Though I later abandoned that cultivation path to focus on other methods, I am still far stronger than a half-baked cultivator like you."
The black-robed cultivator could only make incoherent sounds, while Jiang Boqing's voice was filled with satisfaction as he exclaimed, "The Blood Drinker still recognizes me, but it holds you in utter contempt!"
Below, Jiang Yan watched the drama unfold lazily, saying, "Master! Did you not want that thunder attribute immortal foundation? What kind of metallic essence does this Blood Drinker have?"
The black serpent straightened its body, finally transforming into a long black whip that slowly fell to the ground. A dark cloud rose on the face of the black-robed cultivator, who began to babble nonsensically.
"Let's use this body for now and look for a better one to replace it! Although Duanmu Kui is dead, no one practices the Supreme Shaman's Three Nine Blood Essence anymore. Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree is nowhere to be found… Where can I find the remaining immortal foundations? There is no way forward with this Blood Drinker."
Jiang Yan nodded, and then heard Jiang Boqing's sinister voice from above, "It is still a Foundation Establishment Realm body, and it is not easy to take over. Guard me while I occupy it."
The black-robed cultivator sat down heavily, the dark cloud swirling on his face. Jiang Yan walked a few steps forward and took the black gourd from the cultivator's waist, saying with a light smile, "Baleful blood and resentment qi… how convenient, exactly what I needed!"
Though Jiang Yan's tone was casual, his eyes were filled with suspicion. He weighed the gourd in his hand, removed the lid, and glanced at the bright red baleful qi within it. He sat down cross-legged, placed his fingers together at his brow, and drew out a bright golden talisman.
This talisman was entirely golden, glowing with mana light. Jiang Yan poured out the crimson baleful and resentment qi and began to silently refine it.
Mount Wutu was close to Mount Lijing. It only took Li Yuanjiao the time to burn half a stick of incense to arrive by riding the wind. When he landed on the mountain, both Li Yuanping and Li Qingxiao stood up and greeted him respectfully.
"Big Brother!"
"Brother Jiao!"
Li Yuanjiao's eyes shone brightly, and his aura was vigorous. It seemed that under the support of the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman and his diligent cultivation on Mount Wutu, his strength had significantly improved over the past year or two. He nodded at his younger siblings.
Chen Donghe and his wife had been nearby and quickly returned to Mount Lijing. Li Jingtian looked worried, while Chen Donghe remained calm and thoughtful.
As they chatted, it was clear their minds were elsewhere, waiting for their sister, Li Qinghong, to arrive. However, no matter how long they waited, her heroic figure was nowhere in sight. After an hour, someone finally reported, standing respectfully at the courtyard entrance, "Reporting from Yuting Peak, the immortal master entered seclusion yesterday to attempt a breakthrough to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and has not yet emerged. I thought she might be at a critical point in her breakthrough and dared not knock on the door, so I came back to report."
"Qinghong is in the midst of a breakthrough..."
The group exchanged glances. Li Jingtian, unable to contain herself since Qingxiao was her daughter, spoke up softly.
"Xiao'er, come with me inside."
With a gentle nod to the others, she smiled and said, "We have some private matters to discuss, please wait a moment."
The group nodded in agreement, and the mother and daughter entered the room. Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and asked, "Uncle, what do you think?"
Chen Donghe shook his head and replied gently, "I have heard about Xiao Xian… He seems sincere enough. Qingxiao is my only daughter. I do not expect Xiao Xian to become a Foundation Establishment Realm immortal cultivator. As long as he treats my daughter well, that is enough."
Chen Donghe's voice was gentle but firm. Over the years, he had broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, becoming a mainstay of the Li Family. His dignified presence exuded authority as he continued, "If Qingxiao is willing, I have no objections to this marriage."
Yuanping and Yuanjiao exchanged glances, and Li Yuanjiao spoke, "Uncle, rest assured. The Mount Yu branch would not dare mistreat Qingxiao. If this marriage goes through, it will be a grand affair with betrothal gifts lining up as long as ten li!"
While the group outside discussed matters, Li Qingxiao followed her mother Li Jingtian into the room. Li Jingtian held her daughter's hand, her tone urgent and concerned. "This is a significant matter… Have you thought it through?"
Li Qingxiao lowered her head and quietly replied, "If I refuse Xiao Xian, not only will it be awkward for the family, but Mother… would you be able to find someone better for me?"
Li Jingtian frowned and was about to open her mouth to speak, but then shook her head and said, "Matters of love should always be about mutual willingness. It is not about whether he is good or not, but whether you want to... The family has never forced marriage upon anyone. Even if you want to marry a mortal without a spiritual orifice, your father and I will support you unconditionally."
Li Qingxiao blinked and suddenly laughed lightly, her smile radiant as she said, "Leaving the mortals aside, I have not even considered the prominent families in our household. Mother, you must be joking! This is not some fictional story. Naturally, our spouses must match us in social status. As for whether there is mutual affection… Given our family's current status, how many families can we even marry into? How many would dare to marry into ours? There are only a few families, scattered across a thousand li. Seeing each other once before marriage is rare enough, let alone discussing feelings. We should only consider their appearance and character."
Li Jingtian, who was well aware of this, sighed softly, her concern making her lose perspective. Li Qingxiao lowered her head, her voice calm and rational as she said, "Xiao Xian has shown enough respect… We shouldn't be too overcritical and pursue perfection in life."
After a private conversation, the mother and daughter emerged from the room, and Li Qingxiao agreed to the matter with a smile. Li Yuanjiao nodded and said, "Then I will report to the ancestor and write to Cloud Crowned Peak to finalize this matter."
Everyone nodded in agreement, but just then, a person hurriedly approached. Glancing at the group in the courtyard, he hesitated for a moment before bowing respectfully in front of Li Yuanjiao and said, "Young masters, someone from the Xiao Family has arrived, saying there has been a change within their sect."
"Who has come?" Li Yuanjiao asked.
The clan guard replied, "The eldest son of the Xiao Family, Xiao Guitu."
"Xiao Guitu?!"
Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping exchanged a look, then cupped their fists toward Li Jingtian and Chen Donghe before leaving in haste.
After seeing them off, Chen Donghe sat down in the room. Li Jingtian nudged her husband, glancing at Li Qingxiao who had gone out to collect the books, and said softly, "Xiao Xian is good, but he lacks ambition. He is clever but not decisive. I fear he will not achieve great things…"
"Great things..." Chen Donghe repeated as he shook his head, putting his sword into its embroidered pouch, and replied gently, "As long as he can live an honest life, what more can we ask for? Soaring eagles and sparrows that fly too high are soon shot down by hunters, leaving our daughter a widow."
Li Jingtian shook her head, her voice filled with worry as she said, "That's not necessarily true. Even if he does not soar, that doesn't guarantee that she won't suffer."
