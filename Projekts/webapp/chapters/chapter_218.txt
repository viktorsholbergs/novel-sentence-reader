Li Qinghong, with a white ribbon tied around her forehead, ascended the stone path leading up the mountain. Her white robe billowed in the wind. The spear she carried was no longer made of cheap wood, but instead was now made of white ash wood.
The spearhead gleamed coldly under the moonlight while the red tassel danced lightly in the breeze.
"Father has been in seclusion for some time now… I wonder how he's doing now. Breaking through from the Embryonic Breathing Realm to the Qi Cultivation Realm isn't too difficult—the main challenge lies in absorbing the Spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth. There shouldn't be much cause for concern..."
It had been a year since Li Xuanling entered seclusion to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. Despite various family matters arising during this time, no one had dared to disturb him.
Li Qinghong stuck her spear into the ground and paused. At thirteen years old, she had lingered at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for a while now. There was still quite some progress to be made before she could reach the fourth stage. With her high compatibility with the talisman seed and commendable talent, she easily outpaced her peers.
"I wonder why grandfather asked me to meet him on the mountain…"
Li Qinghong paid a visit to the family tomb and after having spent some time talking to the deceased Li Yuanxiu, she continued her ascent to the cave dwelling on Meiche Peak.
Meiche Peak was part of Mount Lijing now. While not particularly rich in resources, it was sufficient to accommodate Li Tongya—a Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer—as well as Li Xuanfeng, who was at the fifth heavenly layer.
With more Qi Cultivators present, their cultivation progress would be slowed, which was why Chen Donghe was relocated to Mount Huaqian and Li Xuanxuan was also reassigned to Mount Huaqian.
Although the cultivation conditions at Mount Huaqian were superior compared to Meiche Peak, its weak formations left it vulnerable. Thus, it was deemed best to station an external cultivator like Chen Donghe there.
If Father manages to break through and becomes a Qi Cultivator, he'll probably be assigned to the cave dwelling in the lake to cultivate. This means we'll have even less time together… Li Qinghong thought to herself.
The cave dwelling she was referring to was none other than the Snake Demon Cave, which was discovered by Li Tongya years ago. It was spacious, and over time, the Li Family had constructed numerous dwellings within its depths. However, frequent comings and goings might attract unwanted attention, so nobody had chosen to cultivate there.
As Li Qinghong mulled over these thoughts, the cave door slowly opened, drawing her curious gaze. Inside, the furnishings were minimal save for a stone table, a few stools, two shelves, and a small futon.
At the very center of the cave sat a figure with graying hair and a beard, deeply engrossed in a purple jade slip in his hands. A cup of tea sat on the table with wisps of white steam rising from it.
Li Qinghong bowed respectfully.
"Greetings, Grandfather!"
Li Tongya raised his head at her words, setting down the jade slip on the table. His cultivation was formidable, nearing perfection.
Over the past two years, he had managed to untangle the knots in his heart and condense his cultivation. It could be said that he was now at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, just a step away from forming his immortal foundation and attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm.
With the Essence Gathering Pill that Jing'er sent home, I can now attempt the breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm.
While Li Tongya was caught in his thoughts, Li Qinghong's cheery voice suddenly interrupted him.
"Congratulations on your cultivation progress, Grandfather."
Li Qinghong could not discern his progress herself. It was Li Xuanxuan who had informed her about the ancestor's significant progress in his cultivation and reminded her to congratulate him before sending her up the mountain.
"Thank you," Li Tongya responded as he nodded gently, reflecting on his upcoming challenges in cultivation.
The Qi Cultivation Realm consisted of nine heavenly layers, and there was no such thing as the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, nor was there a full mastery of the Qi Cultivation. What awaited cultivators at the end of the ninth heavenly layer was a life-and-death trial.
Many individuals found themselves trapped at the ninth heavenly layer, unable to progress further. Without access to the secret methods of the three sects and seven gates, over seventy percent of cultivators could not even gauge their likelihood of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. With such dire circumstances, only a few dared to attempt the leap.
For those who found themselves trapped in the ninth heavenly layer, they spent their days refining their cultivation. Those beneath their ranks would politely refer to them as peak Qi Cultivators in an effort to stay on their good side.
However, in esteemed sects like the Azure Pond Sect and the Golden Feather Sect, true recognition was reserved for those who reached the peak of Foundation Establishment or Purple Mansion Realms.
Qi Cultivation was not simply about accumulating an immortal foundation, so there was technically no such thing as a peak Qi Cultivator.
Observing Li Qinghong now, Li Tongya took note of her thoughtful demeanor and bright-eyed gaze, as well as her firm grip on her spear. It was evident that she had been training diligently.
He nodded approvingly at her and sighed gently before continuing, "I never anticipated that you would make the fastest progress among the generations of Yuan and Qing… Just last month, Jingtian's pregnancy was confirmed, but I'm uncertain about the child's innate talent. Xuan'er showed me Yuanping, but unfortunately, he's lacking in fetal qi… Cultivation may prove to be a challenge for the child. You will need to assume a guiding role in the future and impart your wisdom to them."
"Don't worry, Grandfather! I'll do my best to guide them!" Li Qinghong replied confidently.
Li Tongya acknowledged her statement before continuing, "I was the one who allowed you to learn spearmanship. I have a dharma weapon here, but it's quite powerful and no one has been able to wield it. When you reach the Qi Cultivation Realm, you can try it out. It might enhance your spearmanship skills significantly."
"Thank you, Grandfather!"
Li Qinghong's eyes lit up immediately at the prospect of such a powerful weapon, though she could not yet fathom its true strength.
However, the sparkle in her eyes disappeared as quickly as it came. She lowered her gaze and remarked glumly, "It's too bad that no one in our family knows how to wield a spear, so I've had no one to guide me. I've barely made any progress, and this has been going on for years now. Having no one to rely on and self-learning my skills has proven to be quite the struggle..."
Li Tongya's voice softened as he patted Li Qinghong's head.
"Your father told me about this before. The Fei Family by the lake is renowned for spearmanship, and I've asked you to meet me today for this very matter. We've found a skilled master for you and have already arranged for you to study there secretly… Now go pack your bags, you'll be leaving soon."
"Huh?!"
Li Qinghong's excitement was tinged with a hint of apprehension. The thought of leaving her family behind and spending less time with them filled her with reluctance, and the idea of living with the Fei Family meant that she would need to exercise great caution.
Ultimately, she bit her lower lip before finally responding, "Thank you, Grandfather… I have no issues with these arrangements."
Li Tongya nodded as he heard this and watched as Li Qinghong departed hurriedly. An hour later, she had appeared outside the cave dwelling again, this time carrying a wooden box on her back.
Li Tongya came out and lifted her into the air, casting a concealment spell as they headed toward the north coast.
"Remember, do not reveal your true surname to anyone except Fei Wangbai," Li Tongya reminded sternly.
As Li Qinghong marveled at the view of Lijing Town below, feeling the exhilaration of soaring in the skies, Li Tongya continued his explanation.
"You'll be staying with the Fei Family as a rogue cultivator… I've already discussed this with Fei Wangbai. Yu Mugao is dangerous, and if your identity is exposed, it could lead to trouble."
Li Qinghong nodded but hesitated.
"If it's too much trouble, I can continue cultivating at home by myself…"
However, Li Tongya shook his head and said firmly, "The Fei Family is far up the north coast, and Fei Wangbai rules his family with strict discipline. It will undoubtedly be safer for you there than remaining within the confines of the Li Family. Yu Mugao's actions are unpredictable, so it's unwise to rely solely on common sense to anticipate their actions. Besides, this decision also provides an additional layer of security for you."
He took a deep breath and let out a gentle sigh as he continued.
"Moreover, the Fei Family excels in spearmanship, and the spiritual qi on their mountain is much richer than what we have at home… This environment will greatly benefit your training. Fei Wangbai also intends to strengthen ties with our family, making this decision mutually beneficial and paving the way for a lasting alliance."
Li Qinghong nodded in understanding and tightened her grip on her spear as she looked onward bravely.
"When can I return home?"
Li Tongya contemplated briefly before replying.
"Until you've reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Once you're back and manage to break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, our family will have gained another formidable asset."
