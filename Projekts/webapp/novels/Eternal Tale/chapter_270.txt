Along the western coastline, countless warships formed an unbroken expanse. The sea roared fiercely, waves crashing in defiance.
Boom! Boom!
Massive ships surged into the ocean, raising towering waves. Their sheer number was overwhelming, impossible to distinguish one faction from another, a sight that made the scalp tingle.
Above the skies, colossal vessels hovered, bearing the true iron-blooded armies of cultivators. They would lead the charge, battling the sea beasts head-on.
On the sea, the endless fleet remained silent. The cultivators aboard exuded a steadily rising aura, brimming with killing intent.
The sea wind howled alongside towering waves, their relentless surge echoing like a stampede of ten thousand horses.
Among these massive vessels, countless small boats drifted in the gaps, carrying rogue cultivators, wanderers, and lone adventurers.
Chen Xun, the big black ox, and Little Red sat in one such shaky boat, surrounded by overwhelming shadows that pressed down like a storm.
“Exhilarating, brothers,” Chen Xun said, his face flushed as he gripped a crude yellow-tier axe. “This is the real battlefield!”
“Moo! Moo!” The big black ox shook its head, nestled between two giant warships, hoping the tiny boat wouldn’t capsize.
“Humans... so, so incredible,” Little Red stammered through spiritual transmission. “Brother Xun, how did our wandering end up... in a war?”
“You don’t get it. This isn’t war; this is blazing a trail!” Chen Xun’s eyes sparkled with excitement. He, too, shook his head alongside the big black ox. “This has a deeper purpose. You’re too young to understand.”
“Moo!” The big black ox shot a glance at Little Red. In terms of experience, you’re far behind.
Little Red nodded blankly, nervously licking his dry lips. The intense atmosphere made him tremble uncontrollably.
Chen Xun, however, was lost in thought, his heart stirred by the realization. Now he understood why forebears charged forward, even knowing death awaited them.
The atmosphere itself demanded courage. Even without the promise of immortality, this battlefield inspired him to fight. Here, dying would be an honor.
Rumble! Rumble!
From the distant western bay, a dark shadow loomed, shaking the heavens. All cultivators on the sea turned to look.
The scene fell into a moment of dead silence...
A boundless killing aura appeared on the horizon, yet it carried no direct hostility. The true army of the Baili clan had arrived!
Giant spirit beasts with snowy white fur, their colossal forms as indomitable as mountains, walked through the air behind the fleet. Their sheer physicality exuded an air of invincibility.
Blood-stained banners flapped under the blazing sun, their presence resounding deep within every heart.
“Jiuhua Demon-Sealing Apes! Ancient beasts! They’ve really come!”
“As expected of the Baili clan. To secure the friendship of the Jiuhua Apes—who in the Great Li Realm would dare provoke them?”
“With the Baili clan leading, we cultivators shall fear no filth spawn!”
Cheering erupted across the warships. Humanity’s strange nature shone through; though all feared death, a leader’s presence was enough to quell terror.
The big black ox and Little Red swallowed hard. Ancient beasts surpassed spiritual beasts by an entire tier.
Chen Xun raised a brow, gazing at the Jiuhua Apes stepping through the void. A glint of calculation crossed his eyes. He would have to prepare gifts and pay them a proper visit later.
As his thoughts wandered, his gaze suddenly shifted, and he saw two familiar strangers, a playful smile curling at the corner of his mouth.
Next to a warship, there were several smaller boats, likely belonging to its affiliated faction. Two men stood on one of the boats, communicating through spiritual transmission.
"Huang Shao, we're heading to the Heavenly Gate now. The Divine Fire Sect definitely won’t be able to catch up, right?"
"Yes, I didn’t expect that killing that elder would bring out the Sect’s Supreme Elder. I’ve also heard that the Divine Fire Sect has backing from some powerful sect."
Huang Shao’s expression was cold. The grudge of his destroyed clan was far from simple; he had many enemies, all of whom were on his kill list.
Dai Xinqing gave a wry smile, somewhat sentimental. Despite the dangers along the way, they had gained many opportunities, which had allowed them to break through to the Gold Core stage while being chased.
Especially that fateful encounter at the Heavenly Rift, which had given them an unexpected opportunity, allowing them to kill that Gold Core thief!
"Though we don’t know what ‘filthy lifespan’ really means, that place is widely regarded as a great opportunity. It only comes once every thousand years, and we must seize it."
Huang Shao spoke coldly, his killing intent palpable. "The Baili clan is escorting us. This chance is once in a millennium. If we can break through to the Nascent Soul stage there, when we return, it will be the day the Divine Fire Sect is destroyed!"
"Damn it, Huang Shao, are you planning to join the military?!" Dai Xinqing was startled, not knowing how disastrous the casualties might be. "The thousand-year Heavenly Gate challenge… no one’s ever returned from it…"
"Exactly. Only with the Baili clan backing us can we truly draw out the black hands behind them," Huang Shao’s voice was deep, his eyes now blinded by his deep-seated vengeance. "Xinqing, I will avenge this grudge myself. If I survive, I’ll protect you."
"Heh, what are you talking about? You saved my life, and I’ll join the army too!" Dai Xinqing waved it off casually. Through everything they had been through, they had become brothers in life and death. "You can’t talk. I might even outrank you in the military! When the time comes, I’ll pull you up."
Huang Shao frowned when he heard this. After crossing the Heavenly Gate, he had already decided to abandon Dai Xinqing. He couldn’t afford to let him drag him further down.
Only when his grudge was avenged could he return to the Great Li Realm openly, and from then on, it would be unsuitable for them to be together anymore.
Dai Xinqing glanced at the silent Huang Shao, his expression unreadable. Both of them had their own agendas.
Suddenly.
Both of them felt a gaze upon them. Instinctively, they turned toward the source of the gaze.
It was a small, shaky boat with a handsome young man standing on it, flanked by two spirit beasts.
But strangely, the young man was smiling at them, seemingly friendly.
Huang Shao’s heart skipped a beat. Had they been discovered?! Damn it, could they dare to make a move during the Heavenly Gate trial?
"Hmm?" Dai Xinqing recalled meeting this person, though he hadn’t seen him before. The man had only glanced at them for a moment before turning his gaze away.
Huang Shao and Dai Xinqing exchanged a wary glance, their eyes filled with suspicion. They no longer trusted anyone except each other.
Quickly, they moved forward, no longer staying at the edge of the large ship, where they could be casually seen by others.
On the small boat, Chen Xun’s eyes showed a hint of amusement. He didn’t think much of it and turned his gaze back toward the heavens, following the big black ox and Little Red.
