Li Yuanjiao and Fei Luoya exchanged a few words, both clearly in high spirits as they left the Great Jueting with smiles on their faces. Zhu Xian and Li Wushao, their followers, trailed behind.
Li Yuanjiao noticed Fei Luoya surveying the surroundings with keen interest and asked, "What plans do you have for the stretch of lush forests and fertile lands between Great Jueting and Eastern Mount Yue?"
Fei Luoya's slit eyes met Li Yuanjiao's gaze sharply as he replied, "When Fu Daimu was still around, all I could think of was running away at a moment's notice… I've never thought of overseeing Mount Yue. However, now that I have such a huge territory, I'll have to appoint several of my men to help gather spirit items, hunt demons, cultivate Spirit Paddies, and earn a certain amount of Spirit Stones annually..."
Li Yuanjiao chuckled and suggested, "My family excels in these endeavors. Why don't we share the land? Since the territory is yours, my family will manage the operations for you. I'm confident that in ten years, we'll see profits exceeding twenty Spirit Stones annually."
"Oh?"
Fei Luoya nodded slightly then asked a few more questions before subtly shifting the topic toward the Azure Pond Sect's Fuchen Peak. Noticing Fei Luoya's disinterest in a partnership, Li Yuanjiao exchanged a few more pleasantries before taking his leave.
Li Wushao, who had been silent, spoke only after they had flown a hundred li.
"Master, how severe is your injury?"
When Li Yuanjiao endured a dual sword strike from Zhe Ledai, Li Wushao feared for his life. Since his spirit was bound to Li Yuanjiao, any harm that befell him would spell the end for Li Wushao too.
Li Yuanjiao waved dismissively as he replied, "I'm fine. Once we return to the peak, you should enter seclusion and take the Clear Cloud Elk Fruit to regrow the two hooks on your tail."
"Thank you, Master!"
Li Wushao expressed his gratitude repeatedly, to which Li Yuanjiao simply responded, "You're part of the Li Family now; there's no need for such formalities."
Just then, a handsome young man in white approached them. With a sword slung across his back, he cupped his fist and greeted Li Yuanjiao.
"Congratulations on your success in exterminating another evil, Second Uncle!"
This young man was none other than Li Xijun.
Li Yuanjiao, eyeing him suspiciously, asked, "Is something amiss at home? What brings you all the way out here?"
Li Xijun replied softly, "I feared that Fei Luoya might attempt deceit or worse, so I couldn't help but watch from afar."
Li Yuanjiao turned to him with a puzzled look and asked slowly, "We were more than a hundred li away from here within a grand formation… You can see all the way over there?"
Li Xijun nodded, the frost and snow qi in his eyes swirling densely. He replied, "Thanks to the Radiant Snow Pine Ridge I received, my vision is exceedingly sharp, capable of dispelling illusions and discerning details. Even through formidable formations, I can glimpse the flowing mana lights and thus gauge the situation."
Li Yuanjiao's face lit up with pride as he nodded in approval.
"Excellent! You must try cultivating the Spirit Eye Perception when we return. With such a talent, you might be able to master it easily and wield it effectively."
As Li Xijun nodded in agreement, Li Yuanjiao continued, "Fei Luoya refuses to let our family intervene even though his territory could yield significant profits with our manpower…"
Li Xijun paused thoughtfully before realizing something and said, "Uncle, do not worry! Fei Luoya does not grasp the complexities of governance… He is alone; how will he manage every aspect by himself? He may think appointing a few Qi Cultivators will suffice, but when reality hits, he'll soon realize that he needs our help."
Li Yuanjiao nodded, adding, "Exactly. The ways of Mount Yue are entrenched—greed and fearlessness run deep. In Eastern Mount Yue, it took two Qi Cultivators and twelve Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators at Jade Capital from the Jade Court Guards enforcing strict discipline day and night to achieve what we have… Fei Luoya has no experience in these things and will definitely struggle."
The uncle and nephew conversed for a while before descending on Qingdu Peak. Upon landing, Li Xijun, with a solemn tone, said, "Clan Uncle! Our family has settled into Qingdu. Rogue cultivators now refer to us as the Li Family of Qingdu, thus solidifying our position. The old suffix Lijing no longer suits us… perhaps it's time for a change."
Whether Qingdu or Lijing, Li Yuanjiao was not concerned with titles and replied with a tone of indifference.
"As you wish, set it as you see fit."
As the group landed on the peak, a little girl squatting in front of the courtyard sprang up, smiling and running toward them.
"Father! Brother!"
"Xiang'er," Li Yuanjiao greeted. His daughter, whom he cherished deeply, had seen him rarely due to his years of seclusion and breakthroughs. This distance had caused some estrangement, and her bond with her cousin was evidently stronger, given how she grabbed Li Xijun's hand happily.
Observing them, Li Yuanjiao remarked with a chuckle, "Jun'er seems much more mature now."
With a warm smile, Li Xijun replied, "Uncle, Xiang'er will be tested for her spiritual orifice next year. I wonder if she will have one…"
Li Xijun wore a gentle and doting expression on his face. It was at this moment Li Yuanjiao realized that Li Xicheng and Li Ximing also had a gentle and subdued demeanor, which was strikingly different from his own fierce nature.
This generation is becoming more and more like those from the other prestigious clans out there… Li Yuanjiao mused silently with pride.
The Li Family's rapid ascent from humble beginnings to prominence meant they lacked the necessary wealth and connections. Due to various insecurities, the members of the first three generations were far from saints.
However, members of the generation of Xi and Yue, particularly Li Xicheng at the foot of the mountain, displayed a generosity and calmness typical of members from prestigious clans.
Li Xicheng, along with Li Xizhi and Li Ximing, were approachable and easy to converse with, but Li Yuanjiao was still uncertain as to whether this was their strength or weakness.
Yuan Chengdun and Xiao Ruyu also carry an air of submission, thanks to their substantial family backgrounds and influential connections… This made them adept at forming alliances and maintaining harmony.
These younger members had been fortunate to receive training in both cultivation and politics from an early age. It was only natural that they found the world to be sweet as honey, given that others deferred to them, showing respect to avoid conflict. They were also lucky to have the guidance of elders to keep them disciplined.
It's hard to determine whether being easygoing and generous or ruthless and cautious is better. Life is full of uncertainties, and it's challenging to make definitive judgments. As for Xijun…
Li Yuanjiao's thoughts trailed off as he turned his narrow gaze toward Li Xijun and suddenly called out to him.
"Jun'er."
Li Xijun lifted his head, his face noticeably more handsome than Li Yuanjiao. Frowning slightly in confusion, he tilted his head to express that he was waiting for him to continue.
Li Yuanjiao said softly, "It's often wise to keep a low profile. There's no need to be perfect. Make minor errors, suffer small setbacks…"
Li Xijun grew even more confused as he stared at his uncle, only to hear him say, "Even Ximing and Xicheng make mistakes, but I never worry because they always correct themselves. Yet you… I noticed that you have never faltered, and even hold a disdain for the world."
For the first time, Li Xijun felt the shock of being thoroughly understood. He could only stare back blankly, wordlessly.
Li Yuanjiao continued hoarsely, "My Big Brother was also a bright and gifted child since birth. He had only made one mistake in his life—picking up that thunder pearl. Good fortune often punishes the bold… Never underestimate this world."
The tragic fate of Li Yuanxiu served as a life lesson for all of them. His error had since introduced numerous troublesome rules to the Li Family and had shaped Li Yuanjiao into the skeptical and anxious man he was today.
Li Xijun bowed deeply, acknowledging his uncle's advice.
"I shall heed your wisdom, Uncle."
