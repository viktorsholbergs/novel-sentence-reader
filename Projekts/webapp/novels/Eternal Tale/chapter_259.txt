Chen Xun’s lips were dry, his mouth parched. He gathered the five elements of divine lights in his hand and unleashed a powerful strike!
Swish!
A giant palm infused with boundless spiritual energy condensed in the air and struck heavily toward the ancient grand formation. They widened their eyes, observing the result with bated breath.
However, as soon as the giant palm touched the formation, it was as though it was swallowed whole. No sound, no movement—there wasn’t even the faintest tremor.
“Moo?” The big black ox’s eyes were filled with confusion. The formation didn’t seem to operate using spiritual energy, and the formation core definitely wasn’t here.
Chen Xun suddenly felt a sense of powerlessness. Even the five elemental energies couldn’t harm it. Such an otherworldly power capable of isolating heaven and earth likely wasn’t crafted by the cultivators of today.
Moreover, this formation truly severed everything. Unlike the formations guarding the Tian Duan Plains, this one seemed designed purely to repel the God-killing Wind.
The big black ox’s eyes darted around, thoughts swirling. If they were to break the formation, they had to locate the formation core. Forcing their way through an ancient formation of this magnitude was beyond its current ability.
“This probably isn’t near the banks of the Heavenly River,” Chen Xun shook his head, sighing softly. “I didn’t expect the end of the Forbidden Sea to be like this.”
His gaze drifted downward. The sea surface here was still flowing, indicating that there might be a path behind the formation. The black sea seemed to originate from there.
But when his divine sense probed earlier, it too had been blocked beneath the sea’s surface. There wasn’t a single flaw in the formation. Their smuggling plans appeared completely thwarted.
“Brother Xun, this formation seems to extend quite far,” said Little Red suddenly, as Chen Xun and the big black ox were still contemplating the formation. Lacking understanding, it could only observe the surface. “Could it connect to overseas?”
“What do you mean?” Chen Xun raised an eyebrow. “There’s no way forward here unless we break the formation.”
“Moo~” The big black ox also turned to Little Red. Right now, finding a way to break the formation was clearly the top priority.
“Brother Xun, back in The Great Li Realm, we never heard of any grand formation like this isolating the area.” Little Red glanced toward the direction where the formation extended. “Wasn’t there talk of some Millennium Heavenly Barrier? Could it have something to do with the Four Immortal Mountains overseas?”
Throughout their journey, Little Red had been secretly calculating the distance from the Tian Duan Plains.
They had sailed from the Western Sea deep into the Forbidden Sea. If plotted as a straight line, they might have indeed reached the overseas region.
The Four Immortal Mountains might very well parallel their current location. However, no one had been able to confirm this, as the area had long since become part of the Forbidden Sea.
“Hmm, makes sense.” Chen Xun nodded thoughtfully. “When the Heavenly Barrier opens, we’ll cross the sea and see how the Heavenly River truly hangs upside down.”
“Moo~” The big black ox let out a sigh. Its knowledge of formations was still lacking, leaving it powerless before such a colossal formation.
Even now, it couldn’t set up a large teleportation array. The path of cultivation was indeed long and arduous.
“It’s fine, old ox. Take your time and learn,” Chen Xun said with a gentle smile, patting its shoulder. “There will always be times of powerlessness. Don’t take it too hard.”
“Moo~” The big black ox rubbed against Chen Xun, understanding.
“Exactly, Brother Ox! These formations—they probably required countless manpower and years to set up,” Little Red sneered at the ancient formation, pretending to be disdainful. “If they grabbed someone at random, they wouldn’t hold a candle to you, Brother Ox. Could they casually set up a medium-sized teleportation array? If you said so, would anyone in the human race believe it?”
“Moo moo!” The big black ox chuckled, clearly amused by its little companion’s words.
“Not bad.” Chen Xun nodded solemnly, his tone unusually serious. “Back when I was in the Five Elements Sect, I already saw your unparalleled talent as an Emperor of Formations.”
“Moo moo!!” The big black ox’s eyes widened in delight, feeling more and more satisfied.
Formation Emperor?
Little Red was baffled. Was there such a title in the cultivation world? It didn’t understand what Brother Xun and Brother Ox were discussing. Weren’t titles like ‘Emperor’ mundane terms?
Amidst the chatter, the branches of the Five Elements Spirit Tree extended toward them.
The big black ox raised its head, wagging its tail, feeling an odd sense of belonging. Big brother, third brother, fourth brother—they finally had family.
“We’ll study this formation and then find an island to set up a teleportation array,” Chen Xun said, outlining the plan as he gazed into the distance. “Old Ox, Little Red, the formation’s matter is in your hands. I’ll protect you while you work, and in the meantime, I’ll catch some fish and collect the essence blood of sea beasts.”
“Moo~~~” The big black ox roared, filled with determination.
“No problem, Brother Xun!”
Little Red shouted excitedly, feeling the thrill of adventure. This place was desolate and uninhabited.
The most dangerous place was the safest, after all. No one, not even immortals, would have guessed they’d make it to the end of the Forbidden Sea!
Buzz!
The giant ship set sail once more. Along the way, they encountered numerous islands, all exuding an aura of desolation and extinction. There was no sign of life, but as temporary bases, they were sufficient.
…
At the same time, an earth-shattering event was about to unfold in the Great Li Realm. Dinghui Prefecture, Chan Yin Temple.
Looking back at the old homeland, the scenery had turned to desolation.
It was already the depths of winter. From the temple’s exterior, one could see a few bleak, barren villages lying scattered under the pale yellow sky. There was no sign of vitality, no trace of human presence.
The temple gates stood wide open.
An old monk, his eyes shining with wisdom, walked out calmly, his palms pressed together in a gesture of prayer. For the first time in hundreds of years, he stepped beyond the temple walls.
Behind him followed five disciples, each with their own unique bearing. The eldest carried a lantern in silence.
The second and fourth disciples exchanged a glance, their expressions inscrutable. They knew only that their master had read a letter, but the contents remained a mystery.
The third and fifth disciples were visibly uneasy, their simplicity making them fretful about what kind of uproar their master might cause in the ten Buddhist prefectures.
“The Heavenly Barrier is about to open, and this old monk can only offer what little strength remains,” the monk said, gazing skyward with deep meaning in his voice. “Old age waits for no one. I ask only that I be allowed to go to the Ten Prefectures’ Dao Debate.”
As his words fell, the wind seemed to rise ominously. The fourth disciple’s eyes flashed with a murderous intent that he quickly buried within.
The second disciple snorted coldly. The sound rippled outward, signaling to the many cultivators already on their way from afar. From above, one could see a tide of Buddhist cultivators and members of various other factions converging on the Chan Yin Temple.
Dust rolled across the ground, and the heavens echoed with the sound of great beings clearing the air. Their destination was singular—the Chan Yin Temple!
Lowering his gaze, the monk began to walk forward. A faint scent of blood drifted in the air.
In a grand, majestic mountain range, an overwhelming aura filled the air. Countless powerful beings lay hidden here.
Behind the mountains lay a massive spirit beast, seemingly slumbering. Its colossal body stretched over a hundred feet—a sight both awe-inspiring and terrifying.
At this moment, a cultivator radiating a steely, blood-soaked presence approached, stopping at the base of the mountain and bowing deeply.
“Patriarch, the young master has emerged.”
“Escort him safely. Let us hope the Pure Buddha Sect abides by its rules,” boomed a commanding voice, reverberating through the forest with resolute finality. “Our Bai Li Clan has no time for the petty games of low-level cultivators.”
“Yes, Patriarch.”
The cultivator’s expression remained cold and unflinching, his energy surging. “I will make preparations immediately.”
As he departed, the mountain came alive with movement. Figures emerged one after another, all exuding extraordinary vitality—a level far beyond ordinary cultivators.
At the center of the ten Buddhist prefectures of The Great Li Realm, a grand sect stood atop a sacred mountain. An immense, illusory Buddha statue shone down upon the world, its golden radiance dazzling as though it were standing amidst the clouds, gazing compassionately at all living beings.
The mountain was adorned with countless Buddha statues, the air alive with surging Buddhist light. From an ancient temple at the summit, a voice echoed:
“He has arrived.”
“Prajna Bodhisattva, will you attend in person?”
“This is a battle of Dao. I have waited for him for a long time. On the eve of the Heavenly Barrier’s opening, he will surely come.”
“Yes.”
As the monk of Chan Yin Temple stepped forward, storm clouds gathered across the Great Li Realm. Countless powerful factions turned their gazes toward him as if they had long been waiting for this day. The Ten Prefectures’ Dao Debate—would Buddhism survive in The Great Li Realm?
Among the Buddhist sects, the gaze of the powerful monks turned cold. This man, a great thief of Buddhism, neither revered the Buddha nor feared authority. His origins were as extraordinary as they were enigmatic.
If his Dao heart faltered, the sects could crumble, their people would perish, and the path to immortality would be severed. At the Ten Prefectures’ Dao Debate, they awaited him!
On a yellow, windswept road, six figures walked slowly. Their determination grew firmer with every step. Aware of the peril ahead, they had already steeled themselves for the journey.
Meanwhile, at the edge of the Forbidden Sea’s demon nest, a desolate island lay in silence.
Chen Xun, utterly delighted, continued catching fish—never returning empty-handed.
