Li Xizhi understood that Cheng Jinzhu was likely wary of him pretending to be a member of the Li Family to deceive him. He placed his right hand on the hilt of his sword, gathering his energy before saying calmly, "All right, but I'll only demonstrate one move."
After all, I only know this single move from the Law of Celestial Moon...
While Li Xizhi was thinking to himself, Cheng Jinzhu grew serious. He drew his sword, its brilliant sword qi already shimmering and flowing, signaling that he was ready for battle.
Wanyu's sword technique legacy had been passed down through generations. As Cheng Jinzhu activated his sword, he observed Li Xizhi's movements keenly. Suddenly, the sword hanging at Li Xizhi's waist leaped into action, unleashing a massive sword arc that rushed toward him.
Clang…!
Cheng Jinzhu retracted his sword, shaking it to dispel the energy of the sword arc that had surged toward him. He stepped back a few paces with a thoughtful look on his face.
Li Xizhi felt a pang of unease in his heart.
He moved really quickly with his sword! Despite being in the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm, he effortlessly neutralized my strike, and that speaks volumes about his strength!
Meanwhile, Cheng Jinzhu stroked his chin and commented, "Your swordsmanship is quite peculiar… It's very interesting."
He was eager to see more of Li Xizhi's sword technique, but Li Xizhi refused and cut to the chase.
"I obtained a dharma artifact from Golden Tang Gate, and I would like to ask you to recast it so that my family can use it."
"Golden Tang Gate, huh? No problem, but is it a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact?" Cheng Jinzhu asked nonchalantly.
Li Xizhi handed him the Dinglin Piercer. Cheng Jinzhu took it and examined it before praising it.
"Very interesting design… it's a good treasure."
"Do you want to make it into a sword? What type of true essence can control it?"
The questions he asked showed his experience in his trade.
"Snow and pine," Li Xizhi replied.
Cheng Jinzhu considered this for a moment before nodding thoughtfully.
"Just bring all the cold jade or cold stone you have and I will recast it for you. It will take about... two to three years! This golden material is excellent. It would be a waste to keep it in its current form. It can easily be converted into a Foundation Establishment Realm sword!"
Li Xizhi thanked him gratefully and then asked, "How many Spirit Stones will it cost?"
Cheng Jinzhu casually stroked the Dinglin Piercer in his hand and said, "Just pay me however you wish. I won't take advantage of you. However, I do have one request—I must be the one to name this dharma artifact once it's done."
Li Xizhi did not mind this term at all and nodded in agreement. After exchanging a few more words, they bid farewell and parted ways.
Upon returning to the courtyard, Li Xizhi found his family preparing to leave. He felt a pang of reluctance, having only spent half a month with them.
He hurried over to Li Yuanjiao and asked, "Has your wound healed, Father? Why are you in such a hurry to leave?"
Li Yuanjiao replied gently, "My condition has stabilized, but I have hurt my tendons and bones… Such an injury cannot be healed in a day or two. I still need to go home and stay in seclusion for three to five years."
He adjusted his black robe and added in a serious voice, "I have a few things to discuss with you."
Li Xizhi nodded, but did not expect what Li Yuanjiao said next.
"You need to spar with your younger brother."
"Huh...?"
Li Xizhi immediately glanced at Li Xijun, who was holding a sword in his arms and was equally stunned. However, understanding quickly dawned on him.
As expected, Li Yuanjiao explained, "Let us see how my family's descendant compares to the disciple of the Azure Pond Sect!"
Feeling slightly awkward, Li Xizhi landed and noticed that Li Xijun, dressed simply in white, had long been stuck in the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. In contrast, he had just recently broken through and was wearing a brocade robe.
After a brief moment of thought, he removed his feathered robe and nodded at his younger brother.
"Please excuse me, Brother!"
Li Xijun soared into the air and executed the River Crossing Torrential Step, closing the distance between them while pressing his hand on the hilt of his sword. His expression was serious as flew toward Li Xizhi, white qi swirling in his eyes.
Li Xizhi, standing in midair with his sheath in hand, felt the colorful light beneath his feet growing dense and calm. He turned sideways and instantly pulled several feet away, shocking Li Xijun.
This footwork technique is too advanced! I can't seem to close the distance...
Resolving to act quickly, he drew his sword and unleashed a powerful white sword arc. Li Xizhi, not intending to overwhelm his brother, also drew his sword, responding with a Celestial Moon Sword Arc.
Li Xijun's sword was ordinary, but Li Xizhi's shone with mana light, dazzling and eye-catching—clearly indicating that it was far from ordinary. When their sword arcs collided, a loud explosion reverberated through the air.
Boom…!
The two sword arcs clashed in midair, sending smoke and dust swirling around them. Li Xizhi dispersed a wisp of sword qi with a wave of his sleeve, revealing a hint of surprise on his face as he nodded approvingly.
"Good!" he praised.
Though Li Xizhi was older and had trained for longer, while also possessing superior sword talent, his extensive study of spells in the sect meant he had dedicated less time to swordsmanship than Li Xijun. Despite having the advantage of a dharma artifact, he found himself at a slight disadvantage.
Li Xijun seized the upper hand with that one move, eager to close in and unleash sword qi. However, Li Xizhi shook his head with a smile, performed a hand seal, and a vibrant light burst forth.
Floating Light Gathering.
Colorful lights floated about, shimmering and flickering like lightning. In an instant, Li Xijun felt his grip empty and realized that his sword had flown into Li Xizhi's hand.
"What kind of spell was that?!" Li Xijun exclaimed in shock.
Li Yuanjiao, who had been quietly observing the fight, was taken aback. When he saw Li Xizhi snatch the sword from Li Xijun with a swift motion, his expression shifted to one of alarm.
I knew it… there's a method to counter weapon arts!
Rogue and clan cultivators typically could not practice these spells or techniques, relying instead on weapon skills like swords, spears, and sabers to fight against the immortal sects. These skills were easy to learn but had high potential.
Hence, Li Yuanjiao had long suspected that the Azure Pond Sect possessed spells specifically designed to counter them.
His heart raced.
If that's the case, how can we possibly win? It takes just a spell for them to disarm us!
Although Li Xijun was caught off guard, he was quick to react. He swiftly brought his fingers together and unleashed Slaughter Jun Kui Light. White light surged forward, aimed directly at Li Xizhi.
"Good spell," Li Xizhi complimented. He quickly performed a hand seal, bending his middle and ring fingers into his palm, raising the others to form a triangle shape, and reciting a brief chant.
"Enter, me, heart, cauldron."
As soon as he finished speaking, the Kui Light formed a white line, swirling gracefully before landing in his palm. With a gentle twist, he redirected it, causing the white energy to flow and freeze the ground beneath them.
After witnessing this display, Li Xijun could only sigh in resignation. Li Yuanjiao and Li Xuanxuan exchanged glances, both astonished.
Zhi'er is not a direct descendant of Azure Pond, yet the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique is a complete and comprehensive manual even by the standards of the Azure Pond is already this powerful! If he were part of the Chi Family...
Li Xizhi cupped his fist to his younger brother. Noticing the silent expressions of the two elders, he assured softly, "Zhi'er is not weak in the sect..."
Li Yuanjiao sighed and asked, "How many spells can an average Azure Pond disciple practice?"
Li Xizhi replied respectfully, "Three or four. If they attempt more, it might delay their foundation establishment."
Glancing at his father, he hesitated before adding, "Disciples in the sect typically establish their foundation in their fifties or sixties. It's not solely due to their talent but rather the time lost practicing spells while waiting for the opportunity to break through. If certain spells remain unpracticed during the Qi Cultivation Realm, achieving Foundation Establishment becomes significantly more challenging."
"Why is that?" Li Yuanjiao asked, frowning slightly.
Li Xizhi explained, "Once a cultivator establishes their immortal foundation, many divine wonders naturally manifest. If the spells they intend to learn do not harmonize with them, improvement becomes difficult…"
"Conversely, if those spells are learned before establishing the foundation, they may be influenced positively by the immortal foundation, leading to remarkable changes. Thus, disciples in the sect strive to push themselves as much as possible. Unfortunately, some end up aging without progress, resulting in numerous tragedies.
