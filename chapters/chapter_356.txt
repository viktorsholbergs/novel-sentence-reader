As soon as Li Yuanjiao put away the jade seal, he caught sight of a stream of light rising in the distance, quickly approaching them. A man and a woman were riding a flying shuttle and soon landed nearby. Several Azure Pond Sect disciples rose on their flying shuttles promptly, forming hand seals as they shouted in unison, "The Azure Pond Cloudliner is here, who goes there?"
The woman, riding the flying shuttle, furrowed her brows but did not stop. She bypassed the disciples, and the spells they cast were futile as they were blocked by a few talismans she threw out, causing them to fall heavily to the ground.
These disciples were outer disciples of the Azure Pond Sect, only slightly higher in status than attendants, and were all at the Embryonic Breathing Realm. The woman managed to barge through them, panting as she landed beside Li Yuanjiao.
"Brother!" she urgently called out.
"Qingxiao?!"
Li Yuanjiao was taken aback, greatly shocked. The female cultivator before him, her face slightly flushed, was none other than Li Qingxiao. She was only at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, yet she stood behind him with her hand on her sword, watching the others intently.
Li Yuanjiao, understanding that Li Qingxiao had come to support him, felt deeply moved but also slightly angered. He whispered sharply, "Why are you so reckless?!"
A man at the back hurriedly stepped forward, pulling Li Qingxiao behind him, and awkwardly cleared his throat before speaking in an apologetic tone.
"Xiao Xian of the Xiao Family greets the immortal sect's Emissary. My wife does not understand the rules and has been disrespectful… I hope you can forgive us."
"No matter." Yu Muxian's gaze lingered briefly on Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian before continuing, "I will not hold you here any longer. Feel free to go about your business!"
"Thank you, Emissary. Yuanjiao shall take his leave now," Li Yuanjiao replied as he discreetly glanced at Yu Muxian's robe. Li Qingxiao seemed bewildered and was about to say something but closed her mouth obediently after receiving a stern look from Li Yuanjiao.
The Li Family members, feeling as if they had received a pardon, quickly flew off. Li Qingxiao and Xiao Xian, unable to fly since they were not Qi Cultivators, followed on their flying shuttle.
After traveling a few li, Li Qingxiao complained, "Brother, how could you keep such a huge matter from me?! I only heard about it from home. Did Yu Muxian… give our family any trouble?"
"No, he did not." Li Yuanjiao shook his head and explained the situation to her briefly. Then, he turned to Xiao Xian and cupped his fist. "I apologize for my younger sister's ignorance!"
"No apologies needed!" Xiao Xian hurriedly replied, waving his hands.
"I am only an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator without much ability and rely on Xiao Family's influence. This was not only Qingxiao's impulsive decision; I've considered it as well."
Seeing Xiao Xian speaking up for Li Qingxiao, Li Yuanjiao thought more highly of him. Li Qingxiao, ignoring the politeness between the two men, nodded thoughtfully and said, "I heard Yu Muxian is the precious son-in-law of Daoist Master Yuanwu and usually does not involve himself with the Yu Family. From what I have seen, he seems quite unkind and unloyal…"
Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, distracted as he was still thinking about the jade buckle. Xiao Xian hesitated briefly before speaking in a low voice, "Not necessarily… I have a clan uncle who was close to the Yu Family. He mentioned knowing the younger generation of the Yu Family."
Feeling it was awkward to speak about the Xiao Family's past attempts to support the Yu Family, Xiao Xian reluctantly continued as both Li Qingxiao and Li Yuanjiao were looking at him expectantly.
"My clan uncle once said that the Yu Family has four successors! Yu Mugao is thoughtful and resourceful, Yu Muyuan is bright and courageous, Yu Mujian is pure-hearted, and Yu Muxian is gentle and generous… If Yu Muxian leads, with Mugao, Muyuan, and Mujian as his supporters, they will shine for generations. No one could oppose them."
He paused, feeling somewhat embarrassed. Now that Yu Muyuan was dead, Yu Muxian was heartless, and Yu Mujian had left the family, only Yu Mugao was left struggling to support the family. Xiao Xian could not help but think to himself, Clan Uncle said it with such confidence... no wonder he has not returned home for years. He must be afraid of becoming a laughing stock.
While he pondered silently, he spoke, "Judging by those words, Yu Muxian should not be this heartless."
Li Qingxiao looked thoughtfu as she said, "Who knows? Perhaps he feels he cannot afford not to be heartless, to gain others' trust, or maybe..."
Her voice became soft and eerie as she continued, "Perhaps Tang Yuanwu has cast some divine ability on him, planted some spell in his mind… I have heard that the Purple Mansion Realm's divine abilities are the most sinister. It is possible that one of the old ancestors from the Azure Pond Sect has taken over his body."
With these words, both of them felt a chill down their spines. After a brief silence, Xiao Xian whispered, "He's a Daoist Master… Let us not call him by name so casually."
Tang Yuanwu had been a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator for many years. He founded Yuanwu Peak and then went into seclusion to cultivate a second divine ability, passing the position of peak master to his son.
Tang Yuanwu's son managed the peak for many years and reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. It was only a few years ago that he perished in an attempt to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, forcing Tang Yuanwu to come out of seclusion to take over once more.
Xiao Xian explained all this and added, "Yu Muxian also married Tang Yuanwu's daughter. He is quite famous in the sect, and it will not be long before he becomes the master of Yuanwu Peak."
Li Yuanjiao finally realized why Yu Muxian was so eager to stabilize the situation around the lake—it was all to prepare for his ascension to peak master. He nodded slowly as it all came together in his mind. The group landed before the Li Family's mountain, where Li Yuanping was already waiting in the courtyard.
"Borhter Ping!" Li Qingxiao called out.
Li Yuanping was momentarily stunned upon seeing her but then greeted her happily, "Sister Qingxiao!"
Li Qingxiao, having been married into the Xiao Family for several years, had grown accustomed to their ways. Despite her ordinary looks, her elegant attire made Li Yuanping take a moment to recognize her.
After a brief chat, she smiled and said, "I have not seen our parents in years. I will first take my husband to greet them, and then come down the mountain to discuss matters with Second Brother."
"Of course," Li Yuanjiao responded with a tender smile as he nodded. After Li Qingxiao and her husband went up the mountain, he then hurried into the hall and asked in a low voice, "Has there been any unusual activity at home?"
Li Yuanping nodded calmly and replied, "Ximing, Xizhi, and Xijun all had visions. When I asked them carefully, they all described seeing a man in white holding a jade buckle."
Originally, Li Ximing had been cultivating in Lijing Town under Li Yuanping's watch. With Li Xizhi preparing to enter the Azure Pond Sect, he had been spending more time with their mother. Li Yuanping had already called the children back and hidden them on the mountain.
Li Yuanping himself had not received any talismans and thus felt nothing significant. However, Li Yuanjiao had felt it profoundly. He shook his head and said gravely, "This is... caused by the immortal mirror. Up the mountain we go!"
