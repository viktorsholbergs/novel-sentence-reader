Xiao Yuansi tapped the alchemy furnace in front of him and the final batch of Snake Essence Pills flew out instantly, glowing brightly as they circled in the air, before each landed neatly in the jade bottle in his hand.
"Alright… from these seven Snake Dragon Fruit, we've managed to produce forty-five pills. According to the usual rules we've established, I'll take nine, and the remaining thirty-six are for your family," Xiao Yuansi suggested.
Li Tongya shook his head repeatedly upon hearing this, having grown far beyond the young man he once was when he first stepped onto the path of immortality by the lake.
After three or four decades of cultivation by the lake, he was well aware of the usual shares in alchemy and insisted, "Senior! You're being far too generous to my family… In the realm of alchemy, if one provides their own materials and the success rate exceeds fifty percent, the remainder belongs entirely to the alchemist. There's no precedent for taking only after achieving a seventy percent yield! You've assisted my family greatly, how can we take advantage of you..."
Xiao Yuansi paused before a gentle smile crossed his face.
"I have already broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm; these Snake Essence Pills are of no use to me. Taking these nine is merely an effort to not break tradition. Your family has many younger members who need these pills far more than I do. There's no need for such formalities with me!"
"Absolutely not!" Li Tongya refuted immediately. He understood that it was Xiao Yuansi's sense of obligation because of what had happened at Chejing, and was simply wishing to make amends to the Li Family. He then continued graciously, "But you're right… we do indeed urgently need these pills. I shall accept your goodwill then!"
After saying this, he took out fifty Spirit Stones from his storage pouch and placed them on the table, respectfully saying, "Since these pills are of no use to Senior, these are the Spirit Stones you rightfully deserve… Please accept them!"
Xiao Yuansi calculated quickly and realized that Li Tongya was still valuing them based on a fifty percent share, and the fifty Spirit Stones were actually more than sufficient.
With a wave of his sleeve, he accepted them, not wanting to argue with him.
"Well, I won't make it difficult for you then… I'll accept them."
As he stood up preparing to take his leave, Xiao Yuansi suddenly remembered something and said warmly, "The Lixia Prefecture has been devastated with hardly any population left… My Xiao Family will need to migrate some people over from the various families along the Guli Road. A junior will come by later to discuss the details."
"Understood, Senior. Safe travels!" Li Tongya quickly replied, watching as Xiao Yuansi rode his flying shuttle away, disappearing into the horizon.
It was only then did Li Xuanxuan dared to come into the courtyard. Seeing the table filled with jade bottles, his face lit up with joy. "With these pills, the cultivation of our family members can advance further!" he exclaimed gleefully.
Li Tongya nodded, collecting the pills on the table with a wave of his sleeve.
"The Snake Essence Pill is known for its mild nature, suitable for those at the Embryonic Breathing Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm. They're just what our family needs right now," he remarked with an approving nod.
Li Xuanxuan estimated the timing and smiled, "I've been at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm for two years now… With these Snake Essence Pills, plus a talisman pill of each major realm, I have great confidence in breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm!"
Li Tongya handed him the pills, asking softly, "Have you decided on which cultivation method to pursue?"
"Though the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique is powerful, the required Profound Yin Thunder Liquid can only be collected during specific thunderstorms… and I can't wait that long. So, I'm choosing between the River One Qi Technique and the Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique. Both are unique in their own way, but I'm leaning toward the latter," Li Xuanxuan explained his decision in one breath, clearly having thought through this a long time ago.
Li Tongya simply waved his hand in response to this.
"...And your reasons?"
"The Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique uses the vitality-rich and nimble Cave Spring Clear Qi for qi cultivation, which will greatly aid in talisman crafting. Having delved into the art of talismans for over a decade, I believe it could significantly contribute to our family's needs. Moreover, Xuanling is proficient with the sword, and the River One Qi Technique suits him perfectly. If everyone in our family were to cultivate the River Pure Qi, our common traits would make us easy targets for our enemies..." Li Xuanxuan said thoughtfully, his face serious.
Li Tongya nodded in agreement and handed over a portion of Cave Spring Clear Qi he had collected over the past few years.
"Sounds like you have a good plan! Make all the necessary arrangements first before entering seclusion… If Yuanxiu can't handle the family affairs, then get Xuanling to do it," he advised.
Li Xuanxuan nodded firmly. Li Tongya then took out the Spirit Eye Perception jade slip, instructing him to deliver it to Xuanfeng in seclusion, and then retrieved another light purple one titled the Secrets of Alchemy.
"I've glanced through this. Not everyone is cut out for alchemy… it requires a certain talent. Copy the section on conjuring Pill Flame from this slip and distribute it among the family's disciples. In the coming years, if anyone manages to conjure the Pill Flame, have them seek me out on Meiche Peak."
Li Xuanxuan acknowledged the instructions and left. Li Tongya then picked up the sheathed Qingche Sword, gazing at it for a moment before firmly grasping the hilt and exerting a gentle force.
Clang!
A soft white light poured forth, illuminating the courtyard with a gleam of aqua and white sword light, casting ripples of light throughout the cave. In fact, the force was so strong that it caused the sword at Li Tongya's waist to tremble resonantly.
"Jing'er..."
The moment Li Tongya touched the sword, he had realized that using the initial stance of the Celestial Moon Slash technique would allow him to draw this spirit blade.
At that time, Xiao Yuansi was nearby, so he did not apply much force. Now, drawing the sword from its sheath, he saw the word "Qingche" engraved on the blade.
"I'm sorry that you've suffered…" he whispered, his voice pained.
The Qingche Sword hummed in his hand, radiating a cold brilliance. Li Tongya noticed a new word coming out from the sword tassel—Annihilate.
"Annihilate... Qingche..." Li Tongya pursed his lips and sheathed the sword, then flew toward Meiche Peak.
Li Xuanxuan, having made all the necessary arrangements, took the spiritual qi he received from Li Tongya and went to Meiche Peak for seclusion, leaving Li Xuanling and Li Yuanxiu in charge of the family affairs.
Li Qinghong and Li Yuanjiao had learned the Reception Method on the mountain and were now using the moonlight to condense the Profound Scenery Chakra.
Meanwhile, on Lijing Peak.
Knock, knock.
Li Yuanxiu entered the courtyard with a smile. Li Yuanjiao, who had just finished his cultivation, was practicing with his sword in the courtyard.
Seeing Li Yuanxiu, he quickly greeted him with a bright smile.
"Big brother!"
"Come here, Yuanjiao."
Li Yuanxiu ruffled up his hair and handed him a jade bottle. "This is the medicinal pill that your fourth granduncle sent back. Take good care of it and use it when you're about to break through," he said warmly, his gaze tender.
In order to keep Li Chejing's death a secret, Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan claimed the items Xiao Yuansi brought back as sent by Li Chejing. Li Yuanxiu and the others, not knowing the truth, naturally accepted them happily.
Li Yuanjiao, having received a talisman seed and rapidly breaking through the Profound Scenery stage with the help of moonlight, was privy to the family's secret. He had taken the spiritual oath and had been cultivating on the mountain since then.
Seeing Li Yuanjiao obediently nodding and accepting it, Li Yuanxiu felt relieved that he had personally delivered the medicinal pills as instructed by Li Xuanxuan before his seclusion.
"After all, the Snake Essence Pills are precious… It's better to deliver them personally to avoid any unsightly incidents and unnecessary trouble."
Li Yuanxiu's lips curled into a small smile.
Although the cultivators in the branch family had been obedient with no unsightly incidents occurring so far, he still did not trust them fully. Hence, he preferred to handle such important matters personally.
"Chief!"
While Li Yuanxiu was still deep in his thoughts, Li Pingyi and the others entered the courtyard hurriedly, coming up to him with several town managers following closely behind. Their heads were all bowed, and none of them dared to speak.
Since Li Yuanxiu was managing affairs in the Clan Affairs Courtyard, Li Pingyi naturally addressed him as the clan leader.
Hearing Li Pingyi calling him 'chief' instead of 'young clan head' with town managers behind him, Li Yuanxiu knew something had happened to the clan disciples.
"What's the trouble?"
I've just praised our disciples, and now there's trouble… How truly laughable!
Li Pingyi did not dare to beat around the bush, looking somewhat troubled as he responded hastily, "Clan Uncle Qiuyang has returned from the mines… He has already broken through to the Jade Capital stage and possesses a spiritual sense now! When he returned to town, he took a stroll on the street and…unexpectedly, with a sweep of his spiritual sense, caught several clan disciples in the courtyard... They… in the courtyard..."
"What were they doing?" Li Yuanxiu asked sternly, only to hear Li Pingyi grit his teeth and say, "Gambling on dog fights… Some were stripped naked and fooling around with women in the courtyard..."
"How dare they!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed in disbelief and shock. His expression darkened as he listened and watched Li Yuanxiu's expression contort with shame and indignation.
