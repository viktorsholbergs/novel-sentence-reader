In just a moment, they arrived at another gravestone, which bore the name Shi Jing.
"Senior Brother Shi, I hope we didn't disappoint you." Chen Xun bowed respectfully, a slight smile playing on his lips. "When we went to the imperial city back then, we discovered that the royal family had the surname Shi."
Shi Jing indeed had royal blood. The ancient records of the royal family mentioned the legends of superpowers, though they could no longer be verified.
"Moo~" The big black ox lowered softly. Shi Jing's map had greatly helped them, pointing them in the right direction.
"Old Ox, perform the rites. Senior Brother Shi is of royal blood; we can't treat him with just a cultivator's rites." Chen Xun adjusted his attire and brought out his prized possession, the 'King of Instruments' suona. "Senior Brother Shi's status is even grander than that of a high official."
"Moo~"
The big black ox shrank back, ancient fears welling up inside it, like sitting in a prison cell! It hastily brought out its special bells, attaching them to itself.
"Play the music, begin~"
Chen Xun took it very seriously, playing the suona. The mournful yet melodious tune brought him back to his meeting with Liu Yuan.
_Jingle, jingle_
The big black ox swung its bells in rhythm with Chen Xun's music, putting in a great deal of effort. It was rare for Chen Xun to play the suona, a skill he was quite proud of.
"Liu Yuan, Shi Jing, farewell."
Chen Xun looked up at the sky, silently wishing that if there were reincarnation, they could stay together forever, never to be separated by life and death again.
After another half an hour, they visited Senior Brother Le Feng, whom they considered a true master.
Lastly, they came across a tombstone that read 'Chen Xun,' which startled the big black ox, causing it to break out in goosebumps.
But Chen Xun merely smiled, looking at it for a long time, saying it was fine and not doing anything extra.
A mountain breeze blew past, and the two figures completely vanished from Xianyin Mountain, disappearing like smoke, leaving no trace.
In the ancestral hall of the Five Elements Sect, the plaques of various elders were enshrined. The guarding elder outside was trembling. Two powerful figures, dressed like bandits, were burning incense inside.
He had been warned by the sect master not to disturb these two seniors, who meant no harm and might be ancient ancestors of the Five Elements Sect.
He couldn't help but complain inwardly. He wouldn't dare disturb them, even with ten times the courage! His spiritual senses were blocked, and his internal power was suppressed.
He didn't dare to look inside, as everything was completely screened off.
The plaque of Zuo Yiying.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were burning incense with infinite sorrow.
She was a true benefactor in their eyes, and now no one else dared to give them techniques so generously. In the end, it was still the 'elder' sending off the 'younger,' and she had gone first.
"Sister Zuo, although it's impossible for someone with a mixed five-element root to break through to the Golden Core stage..." Chen Xun burned the incense, his eyes filled with sorrow. "But alas, the heavens did not favor us. In the end, you went ahead."
"Moo~" The big black ox shook its head, burning incense, and let out a snort.
"Old Ox, let's offer some tributes." Chen Xun finished burning the incense and sighed lightly. "Sister Zuo, travel well. But, hey, the spiritual medicine garden is indeed nice."
"Moo~" The big black ox grinned and nodded, taking a tray of Crane Spirit Tree offerings from its storage bag, and placing them there.
They paid their respects to the various elders of the Five Elements Sect and left quietly.
Later, when the guarding elder saw the wooden statue offering in front of Zuo Yiying's plaque, he fell into deep thought. Could it be some hidden legacy?
In the sect master's hall, Ding Qiu was restless, sitting cross-legged in the hall, unable to calm his mind. The passing of Peak Master Liu was a great loss for the Five Elements Sect.
Suddenly, the surrounding candlelight flickered, and a terrifying pressure descended.
Ding Qiu was shocked and quickly stood up, bowing his head. "Two seniors have arrived, forgive me for not welcoming you sooner."
Ji Haoxuan had mentioned this matter upon his return, and he could guess that these two might have some connection with the Five Elements Sect.
But as cultivators who had lived for centuries, how could they demand too much, or morally coerce the seniors? They could only let things take their course, doing nothing extra, hoping to gain favor.
"Here are five bottles of mid-grade Five Elements Pills, to be handed over to the sect master." Two shadows appeared in the hall, their eyes wandering around as if they had never seen the inside before. "We hope the sect master will use them wisely."
Ding Qiu's eyes filled with joy, but he still bowed his head, not daring to use his spiritual senses. If he looked up, he would see the two wandering around, touching everything...
"Remember the words of the seniors. I will use them wisely."
"Take good care of Liu Yuan's descendants, sect master."
"Seniors, you are too polite! We have never treated Peak Master Liu unfairly."
Ding Qiu spoke with righteous sincerity. Half of the sect's forces had been mobilized to avenge Liu Yuan; they had no regrets about this matter.
"Very good." Chen Xun's gaze shifted to a statue, feeling an itch to touch it. "If the descendants of Ji Kun and Shi Jing are found, they must not be neglected."
He almost mentioned Le Feng, but then remembered he was an orphan with no descendants or disciples. Ding Qiu's eyes darted around, thinking through his ancestors. He didn't recall anyone named Ji Kun, though he knew about Shi Jing.
"Senior... may I ask who Ji Kun is?"
"That would be me."
"Ah?!!"
Ding Qiu exclaimed in shock, looking up in confusion. What were these two seniors doing? What kind of outfit was this?!
The big black ox was wandering to the edge of the hall, examining the layout, paying no attention to Ding Qiu.
Ding Qiu's eyes widened slightly. Why did they look more like bandits than honorable seniors?
"The sect master seems to be a sensible person, so I won't say much."
With a wave of his hand, Chen Xun sent five bottles of mid-grade Five Elements Pills over. "We'll come back to visit when we have time."
The big black ox suddenly appeared next to Chen Xun, raising its head high and putting on an air of importance, subconsciously snorting.
Instantly, five bottles of pills appeared in Ding Qiu's hands. He bowed deeply, full of gratitude.
These five bottles of pills were a tremendous gift, enough to elevate the Five Elements Sect for a generation. Chen Xun nodded with his hands behind his back. A teachable young one. These five bottles wouldn't bring disaster to the Five Elements Sect, nor would they cause them to become too arrogant.
He had struck a perfect balance, helping his old home within his means.
"Sect master, we are about to travel far and wide. Manage the Five Elements Sect well and give more attention to itinerant cultivators." With those words, the two figures left gracefully, not even revealing their faces.
"Farewell, ancestors!!" Deeply moved, Ding Qiu bowed and shouted, "I will remember your teachings!"
Unconsciously, Ding Qiu had started referring to them as ancestors, subtly strengthening the relationship. For an entire incense stick's time, Ding Qiu didn't lift his head, still bowing in gratitude.
And the release of Wei Xun must have been the Purple Cloud Sect's consideration for these two ancestors. Truly, heaven blessed the Five Elements Sect.
"Someone! Summon the peak masters!"
Ding Qiu's eyes hardened, releasing his power from the hall. "Convene a sect meeting. The burial of Peak Master Liu must be discussed in detail and carried out with the highest honor the Five Elements Sect can offer!"
"Yes, sect master!"
"Yes, sect master!"
Several elders outside responded with bowed heads, suspecting those two ancestors had a connection to Peak Master Liu.
"Also, check the sect records for the lineage of Ancestor Ji Kun!" Ding Qiu rushed out of the hall, stepping into the air. "Whether they are descendants in the mortal world or within the sect, I will personally mentor them! Notify the outer sect's affairs hall to send disciples to retrieve Ancestor Ji Kun's descendants. Even if they have no spiritual roots, they should be brought back to enjoy the sect's offerings."
"Yes, sect master!"
"Yes!"
The entire Five Elements Sect seemed to become busy. Disciples from all peaks were excited, knowing that two ancestors stood behind their sect!
The next day, orders were issued by all peak masters.
"All disciples are to be cautious in their words and actions outside. Do not disgrace the name of Ancestor Ji Kun. Focus on cultivation and strengthen our Five Elements Sect!"
"Dishonoring the Five Elements Sect's name is the same as dishonoring Ancestor Ji Kun. Such a disciple will have their cultivation abolished and be expelled from the sect!"
This command struck fear into the disciples of the Five Elements Sect, immediately curbing any arrogance that had been growing, though pride remained in their eyes.
A strong wind of diligent cultivation swept through the Five Elements Sect, even reducing internal strife significantly.
Meanwhile, various sects in the outside world were on edge. They had heard rumors about the instant killing of three Golden Core cultivators from Tianwu Sect and had thought it an accident.
That Xia Yuan had been a well-known Golden Core cultivator, rumored to be nearing a breakthrough...
The two who acted were actually related to the Five Elements Sect!
Some major sects with intentions against the Five Elements Sect quietly withdrew their plans, laughing it off, prioritizing harmony.
Tianwu Sect had already paid dearly for compensation, but upon hearing this news, they were terrified. The sect master personally led a delegation to mourn Liu Yuan, expressing goodwill.
However, the true identities of those two remained a mystery. Even the Top Ten Sects couldn't find any clues, treating the Five Elements Sect with greater respect.
No one had seen their true faces, let alone imprinted their aura with spiritual senses.
