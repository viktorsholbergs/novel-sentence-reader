Upon hearing Li Tongya's words, Xiao Yongling's expression changed subtly. After a moment of hesitation, he whispered, "That's... Would this not be seen as disrespecting your clan? I fear it might not be appropriate!"
Li Tongya, fully understanding the implications of Xiao Yongling's words which were merely formalities. He cupped his fist and responded, "Our families have not yet made our matters public, and my breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm has not been announced. To sit so prominently would be to prematurely reveal our hand. Brother Yongling, do not worry! The friendship between our families transcends such formalities."
Xiao Yongling nodded, understanding the significance. He was concerned that placing Li Tongya at a lower seat might foster resentment between the two families. Thus, he had sought out Li Tongya early to specifically point out the spot reserved for the Li Family, awaiting the very reassurance Li Tongya had just provided.
He then said with a respectful gesture, "Brother Tongya is wise. I have already arranged another seat for you on the other side, and I have spaced out the seats for those from the Moongaze Lake families to keep them away from the lower ranks. With the clouds and mists enveloping us, no one will scan around with their spiritual senses so rudely… All should be well."
Xiao Yongling handled the matter cleanly, and Li Tongya nodded in gratitude, smiling warmly. He then proceeded to the lower seats, with Xiao Yongling personally escorting him before he returned to the high seats.
The area was still largely empty, and Xiao Jiuqing, following behind, praised, "Seeing Brother interact with Senior Tongya is like mountain echoes responding to each other, or moonlight reflecting on a clear stream—subtle but clear. It's truly amazing!"
Xiao Yongling chuckled and patted his shoulder, saying, "You have quite the way with words! If anyone could match your praise, I doubt they'd claim to be the best."
Xiao Jiuqing apologized profusely, though he had a smile on his face. Xiao Yongling laughed softly before becoming serious again, saying, "That's an exaggeration. Li Tongya and I both tend to overthink and speak circumspectly, which is why we can understand each other so well. Had it been Li Xuanfeng today, I would have had to explain everything to him the night before arranging the seats, instead of risking a conversation at the venue only today."
Xiao Jiuqing nodded quickly and then added, "I have learned much, brother. However, I heard that the Azure Pond Sect on the southern border has encountered demonic disturbances and is recruiting aid for Yi Mountain City… How true is this?"
Xiao Yongling shook his head and replied, "The Demon King of the southern border and the Azure Pond Sect are in cahoots; it's just a strategy by Chi Zhiyun. Fortunately, our family is not under Azure Pond's jurisdiction anymore, so we need not worry."
While the Xiao brothers were talking, Li Tongya had already found a seat and sat down. After a while, people began to trickle into their seats. A white-haired old man took the seat next to him and, after glancing around and noticing Li Tongya, his expression turned to one of surprise as he respectfully greeted him.
"Greetings, Senior..."
Li Tongya was surrounded by seats designated for those in the Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm. As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator sitting alone among them, those nearby were cautious and avoided him, fearing he might be some reclusive or eccentric rogue cultivator. The man greeted him but then turned away to drink his wine quietly.
Li Tongya was pleased with this arrangement, looking up as the platform gradually filled with guests. He then heard a name being announced, "Yue Cultivating Sect, Daoist Master Shangyuan arrives—"
"The first to arrive from the three sects and seven gates is the Yue Cultivating Sect."
Whispers filled the air around him. Li Tongya looked up to see a figure in the high seat—a Daoist Master dressed in loose white garments with a green jade pendant hanging in front of his chest, his face indistinguishable. A sword dangled at his waist as he sat on the high seat, quietly wrapping his pale fingers around a jade cup, appearing unassuming at first glance.
"The esteemed elder has troubled himself to come from afar! I am deeply grateful that you have accepted my invitation and are here to grace my humble peak with your presence." Xiao Chuting's voice echoed from the peak, making Li Tongya fall solemn.
The Daoist Master set his jade cup down and nodded slightly in response, prompting Li Tongya to muse silently, Xiao Chuting is putting on such a humble front... This person must be a late-stage or even peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator! Although the Yue Cultivating Sect usually maintains a low profile, it is still one of the three major sects, with deep foundations.
At the lower seats, people were whispering among themselves. The Yue Cultivating Sect, despite being one of the three major sects, was the least conspicuous. Its gates were elusive and ethereal, and it uniquely allowed its vassal families considerable autonomy, maintaining a stance of detached observation. It was also the only sect among them that had a Purple Mansion Realm immortal clan under its governance.
Li Tongya was still listening to the scattered conversations around him when a burst of red light suddenly appeared at the high seats, signaling the arrival of yet another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.
This new arrival, an elder with white hair and a youthful face, held a jade ruler and his white beard fluttered in the air. His presence was accompanied by another announcement.
"Profound Peak Gate, Daoist Master Changxi arrives..."
"Daoist Master Changxi greets the Senior!"
As soon as Daoist Master Changxi appeared, he hastily cupped his fist to the earlier guest. Daoist Master Shangyuan, dressed in white and wearing a green jade pendant in front of his chest, hummed in response. It was only then did Daoist Master Changxi dare to lift his head and turn around to offer his congratulations.
"Congratulations on your advancement to the Purple Mansion Realm, fellow Daoist!"
Li Tongya watched intently, feeling a sudden shock. He paid particular attention to the sword hanging at Daoist Master Shangyuan's waist, then quickly bowed his head, not daring to look further.
He thought to himself, This Daoist Master Shangyuan must be a sword immortal… Otherwise, the other Daoists Masters wouldn't be showing him such respect.
"Golden Tang Gate… Changxiao Gate..."
One by one, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators arrived and each cupped their fists to Daoist Master Shangyuan before taking their seats. Aside from Daoist Master Shangyuan of the Yue Cultivating Sect, the others brought along their Foundation Establishment Realm disciples.
Li Tongya carefully observed that, aside from the positions of the three sects and seven gates, there were a few other Purple Mansion Realm immortal clans present.
"Azure Pond Sect, Daoist Master Buzi arrives!"
With the arrival of the Azure Pond Sect's Daoist Master, the seats on the platform were all filled. Xiao Chuting, smiling broadly, exchanged a few pleasantries before celestial music began to play, creating a tranquil and peaceful ambiance.
Li Tongya looked up for a while, and among the people at the seats of the Purple Smoke Gate, he recognized a familiar face. That person was leisurely sipping his wine and savoring his meal with a pair of jade chopsticks, all while humming a tune.
"That guy… he's living the good life now!"
Li Tongya couldn't help but smile ruefully to himself, shaking his head as he watched the guy seated in front of the Daoist Master of Purple Smoke Gate below the platform, likely reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm by now.
He thought to himself, It really is not convenient right now, but I will see if I can find a moment to ask him. Lingyanzi once promised to send the Spirit Stones to my home, but there has been no word for years, and here he is… enjoying himself!
This individual was none other than Lingyanzi, a cultivator from the Purple Smoke Gate who had once fled to Mount Lijing. Li Tongya had agreed to help him eliminate two cultivators from Changxiao Gate in the past but ended up with two enchanted storage pouches he couldn't use. The guy had assured Li Tongya he would take them back and exchange them for spirit stones, promising to send the stones to him afterward.
Li Tongya had never expected him to deliver them personally, and indeed, after more than ten years, he had seen nothing of it. Now that he had seen him, he naturally planned to inquire on the matter.
"I suspect this old fellow might have welched on his debt, but I will ask. If it does not work out, I will consider it a loss!" he muttered to himself.
