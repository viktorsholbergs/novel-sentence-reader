"Oh?"
Li Xuanxuan glanced at the jade box, noticing the brilliant and glowing light emanating from it, suggesting the object in it was no ordinary item. He laughed and said, "Senior, you are too kind..."
"Ah."
Yuan Huyuan opened the jade lock and lifted the lid of the jade box. Inside lay a gleaming, cold green blade, appearing to be just under four chi long. The sword's blade was smooth and bright, and it was decorated with fine, scale-like patterns that ran along its surface, exuding a chilling light. Li Xuanxuan immediately recognized that this was an extraordinary sword and said hoarsely, "This is..."
"This sword is called the Coiling Dragon Pillar, three chi seven cun long, forged from Frostmire Stone and supplemented with serpent dragon blood. It is a top-tier item among Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts," Yuan Huyuan explained as he held the box with one hand and introduced the sword further, "This sword once belonged to the Chen Family of the Linyu Gate. After the Linyu Gate's demise, it passed into the hands of a rogue cultivator who was later killed by our ancestor, thus coming into our family's possession."
Li Xuanxuan, though not skilled in swordsmanship, was captivated by the sword. Yuan Huyuan continued, "Our ancestor heard that Senior Tongya's sword was barely at the Qi Cultivation Realm. Since our family does not specialize in swordsmanship, we felt it a shame for such a treasure to be wasted, so our ancestor asked me to deliver it to you on his behalf."
Li Xuanxuan repeatedly refused, expressing how he could not possibly accept such a valuable gift, finding it difficult to justify accepting it. However, Yuan Huyuan warmly insisted, pushing the jade box towards him and saying, "My clan sister manages Qingsui Peak alone, and our ancestor fears she may be oppressed. We hope she can rely on the Sword Immortal's reputation for some protection..."
Hearing this, Li Xuanxuan understood the intention behind the gift, thinking, This sword is not given for the sake of our Li Family or my second uncle, but purely for the sake of our fourth uncle. The Yuan Family, having dominated Mushroom Forest Plain for so many years, has deep foundations. Investing in a potential future Purple Mansion immortal clan is no trouble for them.
Seeing Li Xuanxuan still hesitant, Yuan Huyuan placed the jade box in his arms and said warmly, "Our ancestor also heard about the marriage between the Li and Xiao families. The Xiao Family and our Yuan Family have supported each other for years. With your family gradually establishing a foothold on the lake, we'll gain another ally. If things go well in the future, our families can strengthen our ties and communicate more closely."
For prestigious immortal clans like the Yuan and Xiao families, establishing a foothold meant more than just dominating an area—it meant being the strongest in the region with the clan and family maintaining extensive connections. Li Xuanxuan nodded, taking note of these words.
Li Xuanxuan and Yuan Huyuan chatted amiably before sitting down in the courtyard, enjoying tea. Li Xuanxuan, suddenly feeling a sense of doubt, hesitated for a moment before asking, "When I was young, I heard that the Golden Tang Gate invaded Mushroom Forest Plain, causing many deaths, but I never heard of any casualties among your esteemed family..."
"Ah, that matter…" Yuan Huyuan paused, seemingly contemplating how he could explain the matter before finally saying, "Our Yuan Family did suffer few casualties. Those who died were from minor families and among the commoners... Your clan must be aware of some of the secrets involved. I came here today to speak frankly."
Yuan Huyuan took a sip of tea and continued, "Every year, our Yuan Family plants a large quantity of spirit herbs and mines spirit ores for the Azure Pond Sect. The invasion was a way for the Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate to divide the blood and resentment. Killing minor families and commoners sufficed; there was no need to kill diligent slaves like us, was there?"
He wore a mocking smile on his face and made a self-deprecating remark, saying in a low voice, "The Azure Pond Sect has ruled for five hundred years. They have clearly divided among which small clans shall grow people, which clans would grow herbs, which tribes are to be controlled, and where devil cultivators are to refine pills. In five hundred years, only the Xiao Family has been an exception, perhaps because Chi Wei intentionally allowed it. Never underestimate those few Purple Mansion Realm cultivators on Azure Pond Peak. After five hundred years, even the dumbest demons have become extremely cunning!"
Li Xuanxuan felt a silent fear in his heart, finding it hard to speak. Yuan Huyuan glanced at him and smiled. "While the Azure Pond Sect feasts on the table, we are merely the small servants kneeling on the ground, enjoying the spiritual qi of heaven and earth and the blood and sweat of the common people. To be honest..."
Yuan Huyuan's expression turned serious, and his tone carried a hint of admonishment as he spoke.
"This is also our ancestor's sentiment. He is nearly three hundred years old and has seen many things. Since your family has a Sword Immortal, why not send more disciples into the sect? Your family's goal should be to secure a seat at the foot of Azure Pond, not to be just another item in their bowl. Reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm is only the first step..."
Li Xuanxuan pondered for a moment before finally letting out a deep sigh.
"I understand, Senior..."
Yuan Huyuan finally nodded slowly as he finished his tea, saying, "That is good. In the future, our Yuan Family will be in the east, the Li Family in the west, and the Ding Family, a long-standing branch of ours, will remain untouched by us, as will the Xiao Family."
He dipped his finger in the tea, casually drew a line on the table, then stood up. He cupped his fist and smiled.
"Today's conversation has been very pleasant… Please relay my words to Senior Tongya. I must visit the Xiao Family next, so I will take my leave now."
Li Xuanxuan quickly stood up and escorted him out of the formation. He returned to the courtyard, deep in thought, only to find someone already seated there quietly. His clothes were neat, and he was sitting upright, carefully examining the gleaming Coiling Dragon Pillar sword on the table.
Li Xuanxuan bowed respectfully and greeted the man.
"Second Uncle!"
Li Tongya hummed absentmindedly in response as he continued gazing at the fine scale-like patterns on the sword, running his fingers over them. A bright white sword qi glowed from the blade.
Li Tongya nodded and commented, "It is indeed a good sword."
Li Xuanxuan saw Li Tongya's expression and guessed that Li Tongya had heard his entire conversation with Yuan Huyuan. Standing with his fist cupped, he saw Li Tongya place the Coiling Dragon Pillar back into the jade box.
Li Xuanxuan said in a low voice, "Second Uncle, the Yuan Family's advice to us is… to align ourselves with the various peaks to truly maintain a lasting presence at the foot of the Azure Pond Sect. Even if we do not have a peak master in the sect, we must have a few insiders who can speak and hear for us. Our family must produce something valued by the Azure Pond Sect so that we will not be easily manipulated at any time..."
Li Tongya responded with a noncommittal hum and said, "Officially, Chejing is still at the southern border. Few except those in the Purple Mansion Realm know otherwise. In a few years, choose a moderately qualified disciple from the generation of Xi and Yue to send to the sect first."
"Yes!" Li Xuanxuan responded promptly.
Li Tongya then took two steps down and stopped at the table where Yuan Huyuan had been. He glanced at the faint water stain on the table and instructed, "Ding Xiding meant well. Send some return gifts with him when he leaves. While our family will not move against him, we should not get too close either. In situations like these, we must avoid giving others cause for suspicion."
Li Tongya glanced at Li Xuanxuan and shook his head, saying, "The Yuan Family is indeed cautious. They feared I might be unaware of the situation, so they came specifically to remind us."
Li Xuanxuan nodded, saying, "It also seems the Yuan Family is still unaware of the situation on the southern border. They think Fourth Uncle has the potential to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm and are somewhat wary of us. The Ding Family controls the entry point and acts as a buffer between our three families. I will ensure we do not disturb this balance."
"Good that you are aware," Li Tongya nodded. As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, he could be in seclusion for years at a time. If these matters were not handled properly and left to the younger generation to mishandle, it could result in enemies on all sides upon his emergence, which would be disastrous.
Being ever cautious, he added a few more words of advice, "The news of my breakthrough will spread. In a few years, when we pay tribute, our Li Family will be recognized as a prestigious clan. According to the Yuan Family's implications, the Azure Pond Sect's exploitation of prestigious clans is likely more severe than that of smaller clans. Use these years wisely to measure the spirit fields and allocate our manpower appropriately."
"Understood!" Li Xuanxuan responded, then added, "There is one matter I must report to Second Uncle. At the top of Mount Yuting, there is a jade well, perfectly round like the sun and large enough that it takes nine people to encircle it. The well water is icy cold, and several sets of copper armor are submerged in it. According to An Zheyan, this was how their ancestors had tempered cold armor to gather Courtly Frost Armor Qi throughout the ages!"
