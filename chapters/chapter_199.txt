Azure Pond Peak is the highest peak of Mount Azure Pond, known for its steep terrain. At the foot of the peak stood a stele inscribed with the characters Azure Chi, which often puzzled new disciples who wondered why it read Azure Chi instead of Azure Pond.
The older disciples, however, kept their mouths sealed and offered no explanations. Over time, no one asked about it anymore.
The cave dwelling at the summit of Azure Pond Peak was the place with the richest spiritual qi in the entire mountain range. Facing the east where the sun and moon rise, cultivating here could yield great results with minimal effort.
Chi Zhiyun, holding a sword, had been waiting respectfully in front of the stone door for a long time when it silently opened.
An elderly man with white hair and a benevolent face emerged, holding a jade alms bowl. His aura was undetectable, and he seemed like just an ordinary old man.
"Zhiyun greets the Ancestor! Congratulations on attaining mastery of your divine ability!" Chi Zhiyun called out respectfully.
The white-haired elder smiled gently and spoke in a low, aged voice.
"It's hardly any great achievement… I merely extended my life by consuming a treasured pill, and finally mastered my fifth divine ability—qualifying me to attempt a breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm."
Glancing at Chi Zhiyun, Chi Wei cleared his throat. Strangely, two voices emerged simultaneously—one sharp and fine, a woman's voice, and the other deep and aged, clearly belonging to an old man—saying in unison, "Middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, not bad at all!"
This was rather eerie, and Chi Zhiyun felt a shiver down his spine, though he dared not show it. Instead, he humbly replied, "My modest cultivation doesn't deserve such praise, Ancestor."
Chi Wei took a step forward, his voice returning to normal as he said in a low voice, "I have emerged from seclusion because that old bastard Duanmu is about to break through to the Golden Core Realm, and he has invited me to watch the ceremony. Although your immortal foundation has not yet shown signs of harboring divine abilities, it would be beneficial for you to observe."
Chi Zhiyun's eyes lit up at the suggestion as he quickly thanked his ancestor. Chi Wei watched him for a moment before small clouds formed under their feet. They ascended into the sky, heading toward Mount Dali.
Standing behind Chi Wei, Chi Zhiyun hesitated for a moment before asking quietly, "Ancestor, if I may inquire about Li Chejing…"
"He has already been refined into a pill, which has been delivered to me… to aid me when I break through to the Golden Core Realm," Chi Wei responded indifferently, and Chi Zhiyun sighed in relief.
Chi Wei then continued, "The techniques of the three sects and seven gates mostly originate from the Moonlight Origin Mansion, including that Moon Lake Autumn Reflection Technique that comes from the Moonlight Secret Decree. The immortal foundation it builds, known as the Lake Moon Autumn, has the ability to oversee all techniques. This immortal foundation greatly benefits my breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm."
Chi Wei shared these secrets which mesmerized Chi Zhiyun and greatly excited him.
Seeing his reaction, Chi Wei continued, "Unfortunately, Li Chejing was born fifty years too late. By the time he reached the Qi Cultivation Realm, I had already acquired four divine abilities and one immortal foundation. Had he been born fifty years earlier, I could have taken his Lake Moon Autumn instead of settling for the far inferior Spiritual Sustenance, and my chances of breaking through the Golden Core Realm would have been much greater."
Chi Zhiyun also shook his head regretfully. With the refined techniques of the Purple Mansion Realm, they soon arrived at Mount Dali.
They effortlessly crossed over Lijing Town and Eastern Mount Yue, causing Lu Jiangxian on the mountain to shrink back into his mirror, lying motionless on the stone platform like a lifeless being.
Fortunately, Chi Wei flew high, paying no heed to the situation below, and crossed over Eastern Mount Yue directly. He stopped near the white jade steps at the edge of Mount Wu and stumbled upon someone else riding on clouds.
The man was dressed in a glittering golden robe, with white hair and a beard—yet his face retained a middle-aged appearance. His aura also marked him as a peak Purple Mansion Realm cultivator.
Upon seeing Chi Wei, the man cupped his fist and greeted. "Brother Chi Wei, long time no see!"
"It's been seventy-three years… Brother Zhang remains the same as always!" Chi Wei responded heartily.
The middle-aged man smiled. Chi Zhiyun looked up and noticed another person behind him, seemingly of early Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation. This individual appeared unremarkable, carrying a long sword on his back and casting a provocative gaze toward Chi Zhiyun.
Chi Zhiyun snorted coldly, quite displeased as he thought to himself, Zhang... probably from the Golden Feather Sect. This person is merely at the early stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm, yet behaves so arrogantly… Does he truly believe anyone can use me to gain fame, just like Li Chejing?
The two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators chatted for a bit more until the grand formation on Mount Wu suddenly opened, revealing a middle-aged man dressed in a black robe.
He paused, observing that representatives from the three sects and seven gates, various rogue cultivators, and even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from neighboring states had all gathered. With cold eyes and an air of arrogance, he spoke.
"I, Duanmu Kui, am breaking through to the Golden Core Realm today. According to the cultivation world's convention over the last three hundred years among the four states, I have extended invitations to you all. Kindly give me some space and refrain from interrupting the process carelessly."
The people gathered in the clouds paused, and someone spoke.
"We understand these rules… Senior Duanmu is the eldest among us in the Purple Mansion Realm, whom we respect the most. We all have come to witness the ceremony."
Duanmu Kui sneered and looked down at Mount Wu, while the disciples below watched him nervously. He was well aware that these disciples had long been in collusion with the three sects and seven gates, and that they were ready to disperse should he fail. Yet, Duanmu Kui remained indifferent.
Establishing Mount Wu was purely to find some errand runners, and these disciples held no place in his heart.
Chi Wei watched quietly, his expression filled with emotion. He then said to Chi Zhiyun beside him, "Duanmu Kui is the sole survivor from the era when the Moonlight Origin Mansion was prominent… When I was young, I heard legends about him. He received divine teachings from an immortal under a mulberry tree in ancient Li City, rising from a beggar to a Purple Mansion Realm immortal cultivator, leading a life full of dramatic turns."
Chi Zhiyun hesitated for a moment before asking, "What are his chances of breaking through the Golden Core Realm?"
Chi Wei paused for a while before answering in a low voice.
"Greater than any of ours."
Duanmu Kui levitated into the air, his gaze fixed on the slowly rising sun. The pure qi of heaven and earth rose in the atmosphere, while the murky qi sank. The essence of the sun and moon intertwined, creating an ideal atmosphere for a breakthrough.
Divine lights began to rise around Duanmu Kui, his expression complex and unreadable.
Duanmu Kui, despite not possessing exceptional talent, had nonetheless dominated his era with techniques bestowed by an immortal. Having lived for 647 years, he had exhausted the sixteen life-extending methods from the book titled Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree, and eventually attained mastery of five divine abilities.
"He said... I could break through to the Golden Core Realm."
When Duanmu Kui was twenty-two years old, he had collapsed under a mulberry tree, nearly starving to death. An immortal had given him a bowl of noodles.
Duanmu Kui, expressing deep gratitude and claiming he had nothing to repay him with, was met with a simple response by the immortal—"Eat slowly."
After wandering aimlessly for eleven years, Duanmu Kui wept bitterly upon hearing those words. The immortal had then stuffed the book titled Answers to a Beggar's Questions Under the Mulberry Tree into his chest and said softly, "Breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm. I'll come looking for you in five hundred years."
As the essence of the sun and moon reached its peak in the sky, Duanmu Kui's spiritual sense stirred. A faint light flew out from his Shenyang Mansion, activating Locust Shade Ghost, a life divine ability.
His vision cleared, revealing two vague figures in the clouds. Duanmu Kui cupped his fist respectfully and said solemnly, "Please wait a moment, esteemed seniors."
As he spoke, the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators present stepped back in awe. Duanmu Kui listened intently and heard a sharp, high-pitched voice come from the distance.
"If your breakthrough fails, you will turn into smoke and dust… but if you succeed, we shall call you an immortal."
Duanmu Kui smiled softly, and his other four divine abilities emerged from his body, stirring the spiritual qi of heaven and earth which swirled around him.
"Untraceable Presence, Earth Shaman's Blessing, Fool's Mountain Chase, Blood Drinker."
Duanmu Kui called each of his abilities out one by one, sighing softly with a hint of resentment on his face. If only he had not lacked the Emperor's Mandate, he would not be in such a dire situation.
His gaze swept over the Daoist halls of Yue State angrily before he refocused himself. The first ray of light from Locust Shade Ghost ascended into the sky, drawing invisible flames in its wake.
