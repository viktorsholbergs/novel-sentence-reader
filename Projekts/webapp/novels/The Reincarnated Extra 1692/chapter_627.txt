【Tales of the Gods 28】The Adventure God Dorantos and Mitran
* * *
When he opened his eyes—
“…Huh?”
Mitran was sitting on a two- or three-seater sofa.
It’s a clearly expensive-looking sofa, with a soft, fluffy texture enveloping his body.
The frame, exposed on the armrests, is made of glossy, chocolate-colored wood. It’s definitely an expensive sofa.
“…………”
Mitran relaxed and sank into the sofa.
Across from him is a similar luxurious sofa.
And beyond that, a large desk.
It’s also glossy and chocolate-colored, definitely expensive.
…No one is sitting in either of them.
Mitran is alone in this room, which gives the impression of a stylish office.
Just a moment ago, he was standing in the desert, watching the sunset.
What’s going on?
Sunlight, clearly from the middle of the day, is streaming in through the large window behind the desk.
“Fuwaa…”
However, despite being caught up in a clearly supernatural phenomenon, Mitran’s demeanor is calm.
He yawned and stared blankly at the white curtains swaying in the breeze.
“…I guess you get used to it after a few times.”
Here.
A rattling sound came from behind Mitran, as if a door had opened, and then, he heard that voice.
Pulling himself off the sofa and turning around, he saw a tall, well-built man.
He looks to be in his early forties.
He has a brown mustache, and faint wrinkles around his eyes and mouth, but they don’t detract from his handsome appearance.
He’s wearing elegant khaki pants, and a checkered vest.
The white shirt under his vest is rolled up to his elbows, revealing his well-toned arms.
Simply put, he’s a hot older guy.
And that hot older guy, holding two steaming cups, entered the room where Mitran was.
He can tell what’s in the cups from the smell.
It’s coffee.
“…It’s been a while, Adventure God.”
Mitran stood up, and with a slightly tense voice, bowed his head.
…Yes, this hot older guy is the one who reincarnated Mitran into Ardyst.
It’s the Adventure God, Dorantos.
“It’s fine, it’s fine. Relax.”
Dorantos chuckled, waved his hand dismissively, and had Mitran sit back down on the sofa.
And then, he sat down across from Mitran, and placed the cup of coffee on the coffee table in front of him.
He also took out a tray with various sweets from a hidden storage space at the foot of the sofa, and placed it on the coffee table.
…Why is it hidden there?
Well, putting that question aside, as you can tell from the presence of the Adventure God Dorantos, this is his Divine Realm.
Mitran has been here several times, in his soul or spirit form.
Before his reincarnation, and when he was reluctant to leave his home village.
In other words, Mitran is currently in his spirit form.
His physical body is probably unconscious and sleeping on the ground.
“…Thank you.”
Thinking about that vaguely, Mitran, at Dorantos’s urging, took a sip of coffee.
A pleasant aroma filled his mouth, clearing his head.
He also remembered the things he needed to ask Dorantos.
“Is Emi-chan alright?”
After swallowing the coffee, Mitran immediately asked.
Dorantos, sinking deeper into the sofa, slowly nodded in response.
Seeing that, Mitran breathed a sigh of relief.
“Well… she’s not going to die that easily, so don’t worry. It’s you I’m worried about. You were reckless…”
Dorantos also sighed deeply after saying that.
It seems that he’d made him worry.
Mitran, feeling apologetic, shrugged his shoulders.
At the same time, he also has a question.
“Who… is Emi-chan, exactly?”
She’s incredibly strong, breathtakingly beautiful, and she has tentacles.
Even in the fantasy world of Ardyst, Emi is clearly an unusual existence.
Furthermore, this god before him seems to have been quite worried about Mitran, who fought against such an Emi.
A god acknowledges her strength.
It’s only natural for Mitran to have such a question.
“She’s a deletion factor.”
Dorantos, with a serious expression, responded to Mitran’s question.
“…Huh?”
“Ah, no, that’s our business. She’s… well, honestly, I don’t know the details, but…”
And after muttering something—
“On the surface, she’s… well, my… subordinate’s ‘daughter’. Yes… that’s what I found out after secretly investigating. Thanks to that, I now have some troublesome problems to deal with…”
And he sighed deeply again.
“Daughter…”
Mitran, hearing that, looked convinced.
A god’s subordinate… must also be a god-like being.
That means that Emi, her relative… her “daughter”, is also a comrade of a god.
That would explain her absurd strength.
…In reality, there’s no blood relationship between his subordinate, Lairine, and Emi, so it’s a misunderstanding.
“Well, that’s fine. Let’s put that aside. We don’t have much time, so let’s get to the main topic.”
Here.
Dorantos, after quickly finishing his coffee and placing the cup on the coffee table, looked at Mitran with a serious expression.
“The main topic…?”
“Yes. Mitran, what did you think of this adventure?”
Hearing that, Mitran’s heart jumped.
“What did I think…?”
Mitran scratched his cheek and averted his gaze.
But unable to lie to Dorantos, who was staring at him intently, he sighed softly.
“Well… I relied on my cheats… more than usual, I guess…”
He muttered his true feelings, which he usually keeps hidden deep inside.
“When we were attacked by the giant worm, when we jumped over the Great Canyon, when we charged into the stampede, when we defeated the Golden Pyramid… and when I saved Emi-chan. In the end, if it weren’t for 【Super Combat Instinct】 and 【Super Intuition】, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything.”
Mitran’s face, his eyebrows furrowed, was reflected on the surface of the steaming coffee.
“I… alone… can’t even protect one of my comrades. And that’s incredibly frustrating.”
Mitran, saying that, slumped his shoulders dejectedly.
Dorantos silently stared at Mitran’s face.
And after repeatedly trying to say something, and then stopping himself…
“You… idiot.”
He leaned forward slightly, and lightly chopped the dejected Mitran on the head.
“Ow…”
“Ah… seriously. So you were thinking about that, huh? It was the right decision to call you here.”
Dorantos, watching Mitran holding his head in pain, chuckled, crossing his legs.
“Listen, Mitran. The cheat abilities I gave you are very convenient. But… they’re not everything.”
“Eh…?”
“Abilities are just tools. Ahhh… how you use them to live your life is up to you.”
“But…”
“No buts.”
Dorantos, saying that, shoved a small sweet, like a bun filled with white bean paste, into Mitran’s mouth.
“You ignored what 【Super Combat Instinct】 and 【Super Intuition】 told you, and persevered against the tentacles, and in the end, you saved her. That’s undoubtedly your achievement. It’s undoubtedly the result of your willpower.”
“…………”
“Be proud, Mitran. You’re amazing, seriously.”
Saying that, Dorantos smiled.
Mitran… suddenly felt embarrassed.
Blushing, he hurriedly swallowed the sweet in his mouth.
“E-Ehehe…”
He chuckled.
And here.
Mitran’s vision suddenly started to blur.
The coffee in his hand, and Dorantos’s figure across from him, are hazy and unclear.
“Oh, it’s time for you to wake up.”
Amongst the blur, only Dorantos’s clear, deep voice reached his ears.
“Then… keep enjoying it, Mitran. Your life… filled with adventure!”
With those words.
Mitran lost consciousness again.
【…Why is it hidden there?】
To prevent his neighbor from stealing his sweets.
