The courtyard was now empty, with only Ning Hemian sitting softly beside him. She clasped his hand silently, her expression calm and patient.
He raised his eyes to look at her, but the words refused to come out. His throat felt like it was full of thorns. After a long pause, his trembling voice finally broke the silence, "Mian'er, the Daoist Master has ordered me to kill."
Ning Hemian, ever perceptive, lowered her gaze as she took the list of names from his hand. Slowly gripping his hand tighter, she forced herself to say, "This is… a token of allegiance."
Li Xuanfeng's heart felt like a cold stone, lodged deep and immovable, as he watched Ning Hemian, her face pale, begin to read aloud, "Xiao Fu… the sixth grandson of Xiao Guitu… Kong Gusun, the nephew of Kong Yu himself! Cheng Xun'en… an inner disciple of Sword Gate… though not highly regarded, still a member of Sword Gate… Daoist Master… what is he thinking?!"
Ning Hemian abruptly stood, her face as white as paper, as she prepared to rise with the wind. But Li Xuanfeng caught her wrist, his lips bloodless as he spoke in a low voice, "Our family killed Yu Muxian."
The words struck Ning Hemian like thunder. She slumped back into her seat, staring at Li Xuanfeng, who refused to meet her gaze, his eyes fixed on the ground. The two sat in silence, husband and wife with no words to bridge the gulf between them. Finally, Li Xuanfeng spoke, "There is no other way forward. If the heavens and earth condemn me, let the punishment fall upon me alone. I will not allow it… to implicate others."
Ning Hemian's hands slowly fell to her sides as she sat quietly, watching him. Under the moonlight, his temples had turned completely white.
In September, the rain fell incessantly.
The population of Lijing Town had dwindled over the past few years. With unceasing rain, the crops could not grow and instead rotted in the fields, leaving them black and useless.
Famine had already begun to spread in the surrounding areas. Stable factions managed to survive better. As long as Qi Cultivators could soar with the wind, they could always trade for abundant grain elsewhere. In the fertile lands of Jiangnan, starvation could be avoided with effort.
The Yu Family had fragmented into six or seven smaller clans, allowing the townsfolk to live slightly better lives. With their population thinned, these newly established clans were eager to recruit cultivators of humble origins. Additionally, under the warnings issued by the Li Family, they generously distributed grain to avoid conflict.
Li Chengliao was in the main hall, holding his young heir on his lap as they read together. Suddenly, a figure entered from below.
The man, clad in armor and carrying a massive golden hammer in one hand, was tall and imposing—Li Wen.
As a rare talent among the Li Family's branch members, Li Wen had steadily risen to the peak of his power. Loyal and steadfast, his twin golden hammers had guarded several generations of clan heads, though they were rarely needed.
Li Chengliao had gradually taken over authority from Li Xicheng, and Li Wen had become a banner under his command, signaling his clear succession as the family's head.
Li Chengliao treated the old retainer with respect. After setting his son, Li Zhouwei, down from his lap, he looked up. The burly man spoke, "Master, Lord Lu has come to see you."
"Master Lu?" Li Chengliao wasn't surprised. Master Lu was the one responsible for Yu Mugao's death and the Yu family's subsequent fragmentation.
He was about to ask further when Li Wen continued, "He has been intercepted by Senior Wushao over the lake. Unable to advance or retreat, Senior Wushao has summoned Ancestor Ximing, and the three are currently at a standoff."
Li Wen, despite his rugged demeanor, spoke slowly and deliberately. The gravity of the situation was clear. Li Chengliao raised an eyebrow, quickly stood, and hurried outside. As he ascended with the wind, he asked, "He is merely a Qi Cultivator. How could he warrant the attention of two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators?"
He hesitated briefly but soared into the sky, observing from a distance.
Master Lu, dressed in flowing white robes and holding a fan, landed gracefully on the lake's surface. He faced the Foundation Establishment Realm demon before him without a trace of fear.
Taking a few steps into the air, he noticed a man in golden daoist robes flying in his direction. Once the two joined together, Master Lu finally restrained the frivolity on his face, offering a fist cup with a smile, "A visit from an old friend—would the two of you invite me in for a seat?"
Li Wushao's expression darkened as he fixed his gaze on Master Lu. This man was clearly at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm, making it impossible for him to be just a guest cultivator of the Yu Family. Li Wushao stood ready, awaiting Li Ximing's command.
Li Ximing, though feeling uncertain in his heart, forced himself to stand firm. Despite being out of practice, his upbringing in etiquette gave him just enough composure to respond appropriately. With a calm demeanor, he gestured and said, "Please, Fellow Daoist."
Master Lu showed no sign of concern and followed the two into the formation. Once inside, he chuckled softly and cupped his fist again. "I am Jiang Heqian. I once had the honor of joining hands with Daoist Tongya against a mutual enemy. I wonder if your esteemed clan still remembers."
These words sent a chill down Li Ximing's spine. He had read the family histories and was well aware of who Jiang Heqian was.
Years ago, during the Yu Family's peak prosperity, with two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators overseeing their affairs, they had established the Milin Marketplace to further expand their influence. However, this had simultaneously infringed on the interests of many factions, even drawing the dissatisfaction of the Xiao Family.
In response, Li Tongya had united various forces, not only killing the ancestor of Yu Family but also destroying their market. During this assault, he had collaborated with Fei Wangbai and Jiang Heqian, a descendant of the Jiang Family. This partnership had dealt a severe blow to the Yu Family.
Jiang Heqian played a pivotal role in the incident, enabling the Yu Family's grand formation to be easily breached. Li Ximing had only read about this name in the family's history books, yet now, seeing the man in person, he felt as though a figure from history had stepped into the present, bringing with it a profound sense of the passage of time.
However, this feeling was soon replaced by an intense sense of dread.
This man is the last survivor of the Jiang Family. The Jiang Family was founded by outer disciples of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Countless factions have sought him over the years, but his whereabouts had always remained unknown. And to think… to think he disguised himself as a mere Qi Cultivation Realm guest cultivator, endured decades in the Yu Family, orchestrated the death of Yu Mugao, and ultimately caused the Yu Family's fragmentation…
At this thought, a moment of realization dawned on Li Ximing.
No wonder… no wonder the Yu Family, once a big clan, lacked any means of maintaining stability and crumbled so easily. If not for Yuanwu Peak's intervention, the Yu Family wouldn't have lasted this long! So it was all his doing, pulling the strings from the shadows… an eye for an eye, blood repaid with blood!
Back in its heyday, the Jiang Family had been a powerful force. The Yu and An families had been subordinate branches of the Jiang Family. However, after the Jiang Family's main lineage fell from power, several surrounding immortal gates had quietly pushed its downfall, leaving it shattered.
The Yu Family had been the greatest beneficiary of the Jiang Family's collapse, producing numerous talents over the following decades and rising to prominence. Yet Jiang Heqian, through a century of patience, had methodically delivered his revenge, returning the favor in full.
As the initial wave of disbelief passed, Li Ximing mulled it over and found that the plan was indeed feasible. The Jiang Family's inheritance likely included techniques for concealing one's aura. While these techniques might not fool Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of equal rank, they were more than enough to deceive Qi Cultivators.
After Yu Xiaogui's death, the Yu Family no longer had any Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. No one remained who could uncover Jiang Heqian's true cultivation level. Even spies from other factions, at most possessing moderate cultivation, would not have been able to see through him.
Ingenious… truly ingenious… Li Ximing praised inwardly.
Jiang Heqian seemed thoroughly satisfied with the expression on Li Ximing's face, as if savoring the gratification of a long-sought revenge. He let out a hearty laugh, pointing northward, and said with a smirk, "Well? With Yu Mugao's head and this grand gift, does your clan find it satisfactory?"
His laughter grew wilder, carrying a hint of madness, but he eventually calmed, his tone turning somewhat regretful. "It is just a pity… Daoist Tongya and Wangbai cannot witness this with their own eyes. It would have made the revenge all the sweeter!"
