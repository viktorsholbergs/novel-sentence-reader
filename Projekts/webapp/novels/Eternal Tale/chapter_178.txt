In the Snow Listening Valley, Chen Xun and Jin Yu sat facing each other, with a big black ox crouching beside Chen Xun, staring blankly at Jin Yu. It was the first time it had observed a Nascent Soul Ancestor at such close range, feeling quite curious.
Along their journey, they had encountered many Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, and Golden Core cultivators, but the Nascent Soul Ancestor gave it the most relaxed feeling...
The two people and one ox sat on the peak of a snowy mountain, with light snowflakes drifting in the sky, and smiles flickering in their eyes.
"Daoist Jin Yu, I'll get straight to the point." Chen Xun spoke very politely, placing a storage pouch on the table, "A small token for visiting you."
"Moo~" The big black ox grinned, its tail swaying in the snow.
"Daoist Chen, what is this?" Jin Yu showed hesitation in her eyes, wondering what this meant, as it was unusual for a Nascent Soul cultivator to bring gifts when visiting...
Standing at a distance, Jiang Xuechen was also slightly speechless, thinking this senior truly acted unconventionally.
"Daoist Jin Yu, my brother and I come with sincerity, and I hope you'll take a look." Chen Xun smiled at Jin Yu, thinking that although giving gifts might not win friendship, it could certainly strengthen their relationship, "I believe you won't be disappointed."
"Oh?" Jin Yu's eyes brightened slightly as she sent her divine sense into the seemingly ordinary storage pouch.
Suddenly, her expression changed subtly, her heart trembling, as it contained two five flowers and a low-grade Nurture Pill!
"Daoist Chen, what a generous gift!" Jin Yu couldn't help but praise, "I wonder what Daoist Chen requires; Nine Palaces Mountain will do its best."
"Daoist Jin Yu, you're too polite, it's just a meeting gift."
"Moo moo!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox nodded slightly, thinking that even if they received nothing in return, this small token was just to show Moon Tower's respect for them.
This statement left Jin Yu at a loss, as these two were overly polite, not at all like Nascent Soul cultivators.
But she couldn't deny that this gesture and gift made her more favorably inclined towards Chen Xun and the big black ox.
"May I know the name of this Daoist Ox?"
Jin Yu looked at the big black ox, her eyes flashing with curiosity, as a Nascent Soul spirit beast should be able to speak...
"Ximen[^1] Black Ox! Daoist Jin Yu, its name is Ximen Black Ox!"
Chen Xun's tone suddenly rose with joy, quickly taking out a small booklet to write the name, "That's its name, we are sworn brothers."
"Moo moo!!" The big black ox called out happily, standing up and leaning directly on Chen Xun's shoulder.
Jin Yu's eyes widened slightly, watching her counterpart's sudden change in expression, feeling as if she understood something.
With a smile at the corner of her eyes, she looked at the booklet: "I see, 'Ximen' implies the quietness of all things in the west as the light fades."
"A door can lead to good or bad, with many destinies, like the path of cultivation, full of obstacles, 'Xi' and 'Men' combined, truly a good name."
Jin Yu's white hair fluttered in the snow as she analyzed each character in the booklet.
"Old Ox, did you hear that!"
Chen Xun was somewhat excited, turning his head to look at the big black ox, thinking that it really made a difference to speak with culture.
The big black ox was already stunned, realizing that the name Chen Xun gave it was so meaningful.
"Moo~~"
It snorted, quickly taking out a small booklet to jot it down, liking it more and more as it looked.
Jin Yu slowly stood up, her eyes showing a peaceful look at the big black ox, softly saying: "Daoist Ximen, I am Jin Yu."
"Moo?!!"
The big black ox's pupils contracted as it imitated Chen Xun by bowing its hooves, "Moo moo moo!"
Chen Xun burst into hearty laughter, thinking that coming to Nine Palaces Mountain was indeed the right choice, feeling very comfortable.
"Daoist Jin Yu, we have come today with a request, but we will definitely provide something of equal value."
"Please speak, Daoist Chen." Jin Yu had already sat down, her wariness unconsciously lowered significantly.
"Hehe, we were wondering... does Moon Tower sell Nascent Soul cultivation techniques?" Chen Xun raised an eyebrow, feeling uncertain and worried that he might be encroaching on someone's interests, "If not, we will not impose further."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded along, already feeling a sense of goodwill towards Jin Yu.
"Nascent Soul cultivation techniques?" Jin Yu glanced at them, pondering for a long time, "May I ask more about this? If it involves secrets, Daoist Chen, please don't mind."
"Please go ahead." Chen Xun's gaze was filled with hope; if they couldn't find it here, they would seek elsewhere.
"Do you two not have a master?" Jin Yu asked softly, her expression very calm, giving no hint of her thoughts.
However, her heart sank like a stone into the abyss. If these individuals had no master and had still managed to cultivate to the Nascent Soul stage, it would overturn the entire cultivation world's expectations.
"To be honest, Daoist Jin Yu, we did, but it has declined." Chen Xun sighed softly, showing sorrow in his eyes as he thought of Old Sun and Master Ning, "We are now just wandering cultivators."
"I see." Jin Yu observed Chen Xun's expression, which didn't seem fake, and noticed he carried no hostility, appearing quite straightforward.
He seemed like someone from those hidden sects in the cultivation world, though with the passage of time, such sects were no longer heard of.
"I have a heavenly fire attribute spirit root, so an ordinary Nascent Soul fire attribute technique will do. Daoist Jin Yu, you can set the price." Chen Xun laughed heartily again, his emotions shifting swiftly, "I won't trouble you. I'm not picky."
Jin Yu found Chen Xun's easygoing manner hard to decipher. How could an ordinary technique produce spiritual pressure?!
She thought for a moment and then said, "I assume Daoist has only recently broken through to the Nascent Soul stage. We do have techniques in Moon Tower."
Chen Xun felt quite embarrassed upon hearing this, remembering that night of pretending to be a master, but Jin Yu did not mention anything about it.
"I broke through some time ago, but due to the northern war in the cultivation world, I couldn't find a suitable technique and had to wait until now." Chen Xun sighed deeply and patted the big black ox, "My brother and I dislike conflict and are not skilled in combat; we have no ties with the major powers."
"Moo~" The big black ox extended its hoof and patted Chen Xun back.
"I see." Jin Yu's smile deepened, believing his words. One's lack of hostility is evident in their behavior and demeanor.
_It wasn't just Daoist Chen; even Daoist Ximen had such a characteristic._
"Would Daoist Chen and Daoist Ximen consider joining Moon Tower? I have been in the Nascent Soul stage for hundreds of years and could discuss the Dao with you two." Jin Yu spoke without any condescension, "If you two are unwilling, Moon Tower would still be willing to personally present the Nascent Soul techniques."
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged a deep look. The three major powers in the cultivation world were currently at war; they dared not join any fighting force lightly.
