Chapter 22: Who Said There Isn’t a Poison Targeted at Skin?
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
After being hit in the face, Steward Zhang spun around, dissipating the force of the blow. He couldn’t understand how the poison he took pride in, which killed many cultivators, failed to work on Peach Blossom Leaf. She didn’t answer his question. Having realized the parrot actually belonged to Miss Shang, she had been on high alert since then.
The entire village knew about a talking “demon bird,” and had the Shang family sent someone to search, they could have easily found the parrot. The Shang family’s behavior defied logic, suggesting something was amiss. Furthermore, Miss Shang’s distant attitude seemed not so much to shoo them away but to warn them of danger in the Shang house and urge them to leave quickly.
A lazy voice from behind answered for Peach Blossom Leaf, “The compulsory course for Dao Seeking Sect disciples includes ‘1,800 Common Poisons and Their Antidotes’. Do you want to have a look?”
Steward Zhang’s proud poison was a joke in the eyes of the Dao Seeking Sect. No matter how good he was at concocting poisons, could he surpass the poisons crafted by the sect’s Pellet Cauldron Peak?
Turning sharply, Steward Zhang saw Lu Yang leaning against the doorframe, sword in hand, smiling at him. Realization dawned on him – he was the prey, not Peach Blossom Leaf.
He asked “How did you both discover it was me?” He had controlled everyone in the Shang house and no one could have revealed his secret. While listening to Lu Yang and Shang Yuan’s conversation, he learned they were from the Dao Seeking Sect. But even then, Shang Yuan hadn’t revealed his identity.
Lu Yang replied, “Do you know what the parrot said in the village? ‘Who are you, where is Zhang Guanjia?'”
Initially, they thought the parrot was seeking Zhang Guanjia, but realized it was merely repeating what it heard. Lu Yang speculated, “What if the parrot wasn’t saying ‘Where is Zhang Guanjia?’ but ‘Where is Steward Zhang?'” (TL Note: Steward and the name Guanjia in chinese are pronounced very similar)
Lu Yang painted a picture: Twenty days ago, Miss Shang accidentally discovered that Steward Zhang had been replaced. She confronted him, asking, “Who are you, where is Steward Zhang?” The startled parrot flew off, repeating this last phrase it heard. Whether due to mispronunciation or Village Head Huang’s assumption about Zhang Guanjia, the parrot’s words turned into “Who are you, where is Zhang Guanjia?”
Enraged, Steward Zhang lamented the parrot’s meddling in his plan. If only he had killed it from the start! It was not his first day in the Jianghu, Steward Zhang faced the duo with a laugh: “As a late-stage Foundation Building cultivator, do you think you can stop me from escaping?”
Peach Blossom Leaf worried that if he escaped, they’d have to report to the sect, with no guarantee of tracking him down. This would be embarrassing for her, as it was only her third mission, and already complications had arisen.
Lu Yang remained composed: “Did you ever consider that if you could poison us, we couldn’t poison you?”
Disdainful, Steward Zhang relaxed, “Poison, what use is that against me?”
As he spoke, his skin loosened and sagged, peeling off like a shedding snake, revealing a complete human shape standing in the middle of the room, empty-eyed and staring at Peach Blossom Leaf. His skinless body fell to the ground with a thud.
A painted skin ghost. (TL Note: The painted skin ghost is based off a story called the painted skin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Painted_Skin)
Peach Blossom Leaf’s expression grew serious as she understood why Steward Zhang’s poison was ineffective. Poisons usually target organs, muscles, and meridians. Steward Zhang, being a painted skin ghost with his true form being just a skin, wouldn’t be affected by conventional poisons. And who would develop a poison specifically targeting skin?
Lu Yang had an answer.
Steward Zhang, about to boast about his invulnerability, was horrified to find blisters the size of green beans on his feet, peeling off layer by layer, swollen and itching painfully. A yellowish fluid oozed out at the slightest touch.
“What is this?!” Steward Zhang’s voice carried a hint of panic.
He had never encountered such a situation before. When had he been poisoned?
“Athlete’s foot,” Lu Yang replied.
Steward Zhang was baffled, thinking he had misheard.
“You think I was chatting with you? No, I was waiting for the disease to take effect.”
“I figured you’d come after Peach Blossom Leaf, so I prepared a poison that triggers athlete’s foot in this room in advance!”
Steward Zhang’s face turned pale.
Peach Blossom Leaf’s expression darkened.
Lu Yang grinned menacingly, approaching Steward Zhang, who retreated frantically and ended up sitting on the ground.
“You… how did you know I am a painted skin ghost?” Steward Zhang couldn’t fathom how they had specifically poisoned him, considering his unique nature.
He had never heard of a painted skin ghost contracting athlete’s foot!
Now, his feet were so itchy he almost went mad, even considering amputating them. The poison forced him to divert most of his energy and magic power to suppress it, making escape impossible.
Suddenly, Steward Zhang’s vision blurred, and Lu Yang disappeared.
“How is that possible!” Steward Zhang was incredulous. Lu Yang, merely a new Foundation Building cultivator, couldn’t possibly have eluded his sight.
“It’s an illusion!” Steward Zhang realized too late and tried to roll away.
But it was too late. A cold flash appeared, and in an instant, Steward Zhang was split in half from forehead to groin, a perfect cut made by Lu Yang’s sword.
“Well done,” Lu Yang gave Peach Blossom Leaf a thumbs-up.
She had used her Thousand Illusion Umbrella to trap Steward Zhang in an illusion. Imperfect as it was, Steward Zhang, experienced in the Jianghu, could break free in a moment of distraction.
Lu Yang needed just that moment to strike.
The painted skin ghost, known for its eeriness, had no advantage in defense, especially against a sword cultivator like Lu Yang. Unprepared and not defending, he was easily defeated.
In disbelief, the painted skin ghost stared at Lu Yang, mouth opening and closing, seemingly asking: How did you recognize my true form?
Peach Blossom Leaf looked at Lu Yang, curious about the answer.
Lu Yang didn’t speak but swung his sword again, cutting the painted skin ghost into quarters. He poured spiritual wine over it and set it aflame, reducing it to ashes amid its painful howls.
Better to eliminate such a creature first and explain later, as one could never be sure of its tricks.
