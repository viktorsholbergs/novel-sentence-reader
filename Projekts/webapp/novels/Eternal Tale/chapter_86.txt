This person is named Xu Wenlin, the manager of the Chushuang Lake Herb Garden.
He used to help manage the Huiquan Jian Herb Garden, but moved out when he heard that Chen Xun had come.
He doesn't want to miss this centennial event, and there are also some private matters that will keep him away for at least a few years. He wants Chen Xun to take care of the herb garden for him.
Chen Xun inquired and heard from two senior brothers guarding outside that this person's temper is not strange, just that his behavior is a bit quirky.
"Senior Brother Xu, I can agree to this, but we need a witness, right?"
Chen Xun looked a bit hesitant, then smiled, "And the Chushuang Lake Herb Garden also has an owner..."
"You don't need to worry, Junior Brother Chen. As long as you agree, I will report to the Alchemy Hall immediately."
Xu Wenlin remained calm, understanding Junior Brother Chen's meaning, "Your contributions every year will naturally count as Junior Brother's, and this is not an assignment from the sect."
And he didn't want to owe anyone favors; settle the accounts clearly; that's true mutual respect.
"Senior Brother Xu, I promise." Chen Xun nodded abruptly, appreciating straightforward people. If this Senior Brother Xu wanted to take advantage of him and the old ox, he would immediately find a reason to leave.
They weren't friends, and there was no camaraderie. He had learned enough lessons in the mortal world.
"Junior Brother Chen, straightforward!"
Xu Wenlin arched his hand, relieved. He had approached several people, all of whom were rejected; no one wanted trouble during this once-in-a-century event.
If it weren't for some private matters, he wouldn't have asked Chen Xun, and the herb garden wouldn't have major issues if left unattended for a year.
"Senior Brother Xu, shall we go to the Alchemy Hall then?"
"Junior Brother Chen, please."
Xu Wenlin's attitude changed, and his tone became more sincere. He was no longer that calm person.
Two days later, Chen Xun and the big black ox, along with the people from the Alchemy Hall, thoroughly inspected the Chushuang Lake Herb Garden. They did quite a bit of research on the growth of herbs.
Now, without careful examination, they might face problems in the future. It was best to be cautious.
Xu Wenlin and the elder of the Alchemy Hall were stunned, finding Chen Xun and the big black ox excessively cautious.
"Junior Brother Chen, you can rest assured. There are restrictions in all the caves here, and we won't touch anything."
"Moo~"
"Alright... Senior Brother Xu, you can go now. The annual contributions will be taken care of by Junior Brother, and it's not an assignment from the sect."
"Thank you, Junior Brother Chen." Xu Wenlin arched his hand, calmly stating that this person understood Junior Brother Chen's meaning.
Two days later, after finalizing everything at the Alchemy Hall, Senior Brother Xu left, leaving only a token and a sound transmission talisman.
At the Chushuang Lake Herb Garden.
In the center, there was a large lake, like an unblemished piece of jade, sparkling with reflections of the blue sky and white clouds. Various herbs grew in the lake.
The herbs here were completely different from those in their herb garden, but the quantity was about the same, if not fewer but more precious.
On the shore, drooping willows swayed with the wind, standing quietly. A gentle breeze swept across the azure lake, creating faint ripples and bringing a sense of tranquility.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood by the lake, smiling in understanding.
"Old Ox, let's cultivate some of the seeds from here. We will need them in the future."
Chen Xun stood with his hands behind his back, taking a deep breath, feeling comfortable.
The big black ox wagged its tail, calm and content. It enjoyed the scenery, especially when it was with Chen Xun.
"Old Ox, observe for a while. Don't do anything unnecessary for now. We've received contributions, and we need to take good care of the herb garden."
"Moo~"
Chen Xun and the big black ox started to get busy. From now on, they would come here every day.
Not only did they take good care of the herbs, but they also attended to flowers, plants, and trees, maintaining their original state.
...
Time passed swiftly, and a year had gone by. They added the Immortal Points to the Essence of All Things today.
Today, the momentum of the Five Elements Sect was magnificent. Giant boats soared across the sky, and spiritual beasts soared through the heavens, creating a breathtaking scene. The rainbow lights of various colors shimmered in the Jade Bamboo Mountain Range.
Except for the cultivators in seclusion, other realm cultivators stood in various places.
Some disciples boarded the sect's favorable wind boats, traveling with their seniors to see the real world.
Buzz—
Buzz—
...
The continuous rumbling echoed in the sky, with countless disciples standing in various places on the mountain range, their eyes filled with envy. They didn't have the qualifications to board these favorable wind boats.
Most of the Foundation Establishment disciples who could go were descendants of the elders and inner disciples, noble and not comparable to themselves.
Only the true disciples of the Five Elements Sect had the qualifications to set foot on them—those who were registered.
On a mountaintop, two figures raised their heads to the sky, smiling.
"Old Ox, our Five Elements Sect is indeed powerful. This scene is comparable to the top ten immortal sects, isn't it?"
Chen Xun sighed with admiration, feeling envious, "When we have the chance to earn spirit stones, let's go to Yuxu City. It should be super large there, the city of cultivators."
"Moo! Moo!"
The big black ox stared wide-eyed, nodding enthusiastically. After so many years in the Five Elements Sect, it was the first time it had seen such a grand scene.
After a while, no one else came to the sky. The giant boat and the spiritual beasts headed west. All the cultivators were standing on them, and a vast wave of magical power swept up, causing a gust of wind.
Buzz—
Roar—
The giant boat and spiritual beasts emitted thunderous roars, tearing through the sky. Layers of magical shields opened up, heading toward the west.
The calm sky instantly turned into a rotating, furious ocean, with sand and stones flying.
Several towering trees on mountaintops rustled in the fierce wind, and even the beasts in the mountains became silent.
However, in the blink of an eye, everything disappeared, leaving Chen Xun and the big black ox dumbfounded and unable to react for a long time.
"Awesome..." Chen Xun finally uttered the words he seemed to have held in for a long time.
"Moo~" The big black ox also nodded approvingly, still looking westward at the incredible speed.
"Old Ox, let's go."
Chen Xun smiled slightly, leading the big black ox down the mountain.
...
Time passed silently, and countless people in the cultivation world experienced ups and downs; some had great joy, and some faced great sorrow. But no matter what, countless people, tempered by time, became more extraordinary.
Now, more than fifty years have passed since the invitation to the grand event in the Qian Nation. The entire cultivation world seemed to be on edge, preparing for something big.
Countless wandering cultivators from major sects were recalled; even the Five Elements Sect's war weapons were being prepared in a high-spirited manner.
All major cultivators came out of seclusion. In the past few years, it was officially announced that the sects were sealed. No one was allowed to enter or leave, except for the grand event.
The whole Qian Nation was filled with an extremely tense atmosphere, as if the heart-pounding sound of the imminent war was right next to the ear...
It seemed that even the mortal world was affected by this upcoming catastrophic battle. People were uneasy, and everywhere, there were individuals burning incense and praying to immortals for blessings.
Five Elements Sect, Huiquan Jian Herb Garden.
The big black ox had already packed its bags. This time, they were definitely going to war, and they were ready to go to the battlefield!
Chen Xun and the big black ox added Immortal Points to the Essence of All Things and speed.
Their current Immortal Points: Strength 21, Speed 44, Essence of All Things 50, Spiritual Energy 51, and Defense 50.
