“Mana has condensed into Azure Essence.” Li Tongya dispersed the pale white moonlight which was the Azure Essence from his hand with a wave, his heart swelling with excitement.
The Azure Essence Chakra, though not a significant milestone, represented the fourth chakra of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. The smooth condensation of his mana over the past six months left him deeply satisfied.
“This Azure Essence mana seems rather unusual. Its growth is impressive, almost similar to the Jade Capital Chakra cultivation described in the Azure Essence Meridian Nourishment Technique. Looks like my family’s Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra is really something special.”
Holding a sharp sword up, Li Tongya carefully wiped it with a piece of white fabric. In the Guli Road region, people mainly used sabers and poles.
He had searched four villages before he finally acquired this valuable sword from his wife’s family in Jingyang Village.
Upon learning of Li Tongya’s quest to find a sword, they eagerly offered it and refused payment from him, insisting that it was part of Liu Rouxuan’s dowry.
“After half a year of cultivation, I’ve finally made progress. Now, I can wield this Profound Water Sword Aura with confidence,” Li Tongya murmured to himself as he gently ran his fingers along the blade of the sword, causing it to emit a light gray sword aura. It was as thin as a cicada’s wing, yet lent the blade an air of sharpness.
He exited the courtyard and then found a secluded spot in the mountains to practice with his sword in solitude.
“Ha!” He fluidly moved through the motions, then raised the sword in his hand and flicked his wrist. With a swift motion, he sliced through a large curtain fig tree, which fell with a loud crash, raising dust off the ground.
“Incredibly sharp,” Li Tongya commented as he observed the cleanly cut stump before him. He was impressed by how effortlessly his sword had sliced through the large tree.
Pleased with his sword’s performance, he continued practicing for a while before returning it to its scabbard. He took a moment to cultivate and replenish his mana before heading back to the small courtyard in Lijing Village.
The White Essence Fruits in the small courtyard were ripe, dangling attractively from the pale yellow shoots.
Unlike the more labor-intensive Spirit Paddies, these fruits were easily harvested using mana and then stored in jade boxes. Li Tongya had borrowed two such boxes from Wan Tiancang, just enough to fit the fifteen White Essence Fruits he had picked.
“Brother Tiancang, about the tributes…”
Upon hearing Li Tongya’s inquiry about the tributes, Wan Tiancang immediately elaborated, “Just travel east along the Guli Road and all the way to the Xiao Family’s Cloud Crowned Peak. Families in Lixia Prefecture gather there to pay their tributes, bringing their surplus goods for trade at the foot of the mountain.”
“The market at the foot of the mountain is overseen by the Xiao Family. While robbing and murders are rare within the market, all transactions are final and not reversible as soon as you leave the stalls. So, the success of the trade depends on your own judgment,” he cautioned.
“I see.”
After a thoughtful discussion with Li Xiangping and Li Mutian over tea, Li Tongya gathered the Pine Yue Fruit provided by the Wan Family, along with a few cultivation techniques and spells.
He then meticulously packed the Spirit Rice and White Essence Fruits from his home and set out for the Wan Family’s territory.
The Wan Family’s carriage was parked discreetly at the side of Guli Road. To avoid alerting the Ji Family and risking a surprise attack, they had sent only Wan Yuankai, an Azure Essence cultivator, and a carriage driver to meet Li Tongya at the designated spot.
Li Tongya efficiently loaded his belongings, including the Spirit Rice and White Essence Fruits, onto the carriage.
Under the veil of night, they embarked eastward on their journey.
“The golden autumn in the lake demands a journey of 1,500 kilometers to its shores, where the autumn hues turn golden under a clear sky and a luminous night. Using the breathing method, a single night yields a portion of autumn qi. Eighty-one nights will yield a wisp of Golden Autumn In Lake. It will take ten years to amass ten such wisps, so ten wisps make a portion, which is sometimes also referred to as a decade’s worth of Autumn Lake Qi.”
Li Chejing was engrossed in his book, absorbing the details recorded in it.
This Seventh Month Qi Cultivation True Technique provided by my master is remarkably comprehensive. I wonder if it includes a method for refining the Supreme Yin Moonlight.
He carefully went through the book, mumbling to himself, “Supreme Yin Moonlight... Supreme Yin Moonlight… There it is!”
“The Supreme Yin Moonlight, white as frost and fluid like water, shines bright when the moon is full and dims when it wanes,” he read.
Perplexed, Li Chejing flipped a few more pages and then gasped in dismay, “That’s it?”
He let out a disappointed sigh.
After condensing the Nascent Spirit Chakra recently, Li Chejing was on the brink of reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm. Seizing the opportunity, he began delving into a few essential techniques of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
“If I can’t find clues about the Supreme Yin Moonlight, I’ll have to settle with the Clear Essence Rain Control Technique.”
By the time Li Chejing looked up, he saw that a specific task listed outside the Martial Propagation Pavilion was no longer there. He had been waiting for three days outside the pavilion before someone finally took on the task of collecting tributes from Lixia Prefecture.
Just then, the pavilion door opened, revealing a figure. Seeing the person preparing to depart on a flying shuttle, he quickly called out, “Fellow Daoist!”
The person lowered her head and softly inquired, “Yes?”
It was at this moment that Li Chejing realized the person in front of him was a woman with delicate features, dressed in a pale blue dress.
He offered an awkward smile and asked, “Have you accepted the task of traveling to Lixia Prefecture to collect the tributes?”
“Indeed, I have.” The woman looked at Li Chejing and her expression immediately softened upon realizing that he was just a sixteen-year-old boy.
“Is your family in Lixia Prefecture?” she asked softly.
“Yes! I’m Li Chejing from Qingsui Peak. May I know your name?”
“I’m Ning Wan, from Moon Lake Peak,” she introduced herself and nodded for him to continue.
Li Cheijing cupped his fist and said with due respect, “As you’re going to Lixia Prefecture to collect the tributes, I’d be truly grateful if you could look after my family there. I hail from the Li Family of Lijing Village, located near Moongaze Lake.”
“Of course, it’s natural for fellow disciples to help each other.” Ning Wan nodded but then gave him a puzzled look and asked, “If you’re from Moongaze Lake, which is under the governance of Moon Lake Peak, why didn’t you join Moon Lake Peak?”
Li Chejing smiled and explained, “Master Si Yuanbai happened to be traveling through Mount Dali when he stumbled upon me. Fortunately, I was honored with his favor and ended up being brought back to the sect to cultivate.”
Ning Wan huffed in annoyance then grumbled, “Si Yuanbai never stays put in his Mushroom Forest Plain. He’s always poaching people from my Moongaze Lake. How annoying.”
Li Chejing could only chuckle awkwardly, choosing not to respond to her comment.
Ning Wan pursed her lips and then changed the topic. “All right, do you have anything you want me to take along?”
Li Chejing was initially contemplating how to make the request, but he was relieved to hear the woman make the offer first. Li Chejing eagerly accepted, “Yes, I do! Thank you so much for your kindness, Fairy!”
He then handed her a small pouch. Ning Wan weighed it in her hand and then heard the clinking of what seemed like four or five Spirit Stones.
“You’ve never received provisions from home while cultivating in the sect, yet you’re sending items home instead? Why is that?” she asked, slightly puzzled.
Li Chejing quickly shook his head and replied, “My family has sent me some pills before. Everything I need is available on the peak, so I don’t really need to spend these Spirit Stones anyway. Besides, using them for cultivation seems like a huge waste, so I figured it’s better to send them home to support my family.”
“I see. You’re very thoughtful,” Ning Wan remarked, her voice warm with newfound respect. “I’ll make sure this gets there.”
