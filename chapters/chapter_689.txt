Several months later, at the royal court of Northern Mount Yue.
Blood dripped down the steps, pooling below. The silver-crafted throne gleamed, while toppled lampstands lay extinguished in the bloody water. Two rows of family soldiers stood silently.
Since the great defeat of Xian Du, Chen Yang and Dili Youjie had led two separate forces, sweeping through the entire Northern Mount Yue like a storm. Crushing all resistance, they reached the royal court.
The bright Radiant Origin Pass shone in the sky. Anyone in Northern Mount Yue could see its radiance upon looking up. With Eastern Mount Yue and the Li Family’s forces attacking simultaneously, the already crumbling Northern Mount Yue quickly fell entirely.
Dili Youjie knelt quietly at the foot of the steps, looking up at Li Zhouwei standing before the throne, silently contemplating, I wonder which prince they intend to support for this throne… or will they simply erase Northern Mount Yue and hand it to Li Jiman? That would be overly cumbersome…
As he was lost in thought, Li Zhouwei spoke in a low voice, "Dili Youjie, step forward."
The Mount Yue warrior hurriedly got up and ascended the steps in a few strides. A strong premonition surged in his heart, his blood rushing to his head. Then, he saw Li Zhouwei point his halberd at the silver throne and say softly, "Sit down."
Dili Youjie sat down in a daze, his mind exploding like lightning with thoughts racing through him. For a brief moment, he hallucinated spear tips pressing against his neck. Looking up, he saw the dazzling radiance above.
"Dili Youjie, the letter says you are young and capable. A grand fortune is being bestowed upon you, be sure to seize it!" said Li Zhouwei.
In just two short months, Dili Youjie had risen from a destitute family outside Great Jueting to the ruler of Northern Mount Yue. No matter how wildly he had imagined his future, he never thought grand fortune would mean this. He had assumed it was reserved for the esteemed families.
Li Zhouwei said nothing more, merely watching him in silence. Dili Youjie wiped away his tears and dropped to his knees with a thud, solemnly declaring, "The Dili Family will never betray its kin! The Dili Family will forever be the loyal hounds of the Grand Concord of Radiance…!"
He murmured his vow twice, but Li Zhouwei did not put much faith in mere words. Holding his halberd, he listened silently. Then, the sound of footsteps echoed from the courtyard, and several figures entered. There were some burly men wielding golden hammers and other elderly men with heads full of white hair. Leading them was a young man clad in a wolf-fur cloak, radiating a powerful aura.
Li Zhouwei put away his weapon, glanced at him and ordered, "Step down."
Dili Youjie was stunned but hurriedly withdrew. He then saw Li Zhouwei put away his weapon and descend quickly from the high platform, bowing respectfully. He said, "Minghuang greets father."
Li Chengliao nodded. Before anyone could speak, a subordinate stepped forward and reported, "General Chen has arrived!"
Chen Yang strode forward, his sword still dripping with blood. His demeanor had changed after the fierce battles. Looking toward the highest position in the hall, he saw a young man standing there, lost in thought.
"Peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."
Chen Yang had advanced to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, developing his spiritual sense and finally gaining the ability to perceive others’ cultivation. When he examined Li Zhouwei, he realized that Zhouwei was already prepared to enter seclusion for the Qi Cultivation Realm at any moment. This caused his heart to pause.
As he hesitated, he quickly noticed another figure in the hall. A broad-shouldered man draped in wolf fur, standing with his hands behind his back. He was at the Qi Cultivation Realm.
"Chen Yang greets the Patriarch!" said Chen Yang.
Li Chengliao nodded and before anyone could speak, he said with a chuckle, "Not bad."
Li Chengliao glanced around, then sat at the head seat and spoke softly, "In these past months, the Mount Yue territories have nearly been settled. I will keep this brief."
As he entered, he had already seen the scene of Dili Youjie seated on the royal court’s throne. Li Chengliao understood that his eldest son had chosen Dili Youjie as the ruler of Northern Mount Yue and immediately declared, "Dili Youjie shall be established as the ruler of Northern Mount Yue. The borders shall remain unchanged. Cultivators from our family will enter to survey the spirit fields and examine the spiritual energy. All governing systems will follow the precedents set by Eastern Mount Yue.
"The former territories of Huo Luo'e and Fei Luoya shall all be incorporated under Eastern Mount Yue’s domain. As for the eight easternmost towns of Eastern Mount Yue, which are now largely populated by Easterners. They shall be restructured into a new prefecture and placed under the governance of Wutu Peak."
These matters had been agreed upon before the expedition but repeating them ensured that Li Zhouwei heard them clearly. Seeing that he had no objections, Li Chengliao waved his hand and instructed the gathered officials to take their men and begin surveying the spirit fields. He said, "You may all leave."
Dili Youjie, still kneeling, glanced around carefully. Not seeing Li Jiman’s figure, he let out a deep breath of relief.
Realizing that this future rival, whom he would inevitably have conflicts with, had not only lost the most prosperous lands but wasn’t even given a seat in the family discussions. Dili Youjie felt a great sense of satisfaction and secretly rejoiced in his heart, Li Jiman, your era is over. Now, it is the second lineage that holds the family power. The Grand Concord of Radiance personally appointed me as ruler. The only thing you surpass me in is cultivation…
Having only just ascended to this position, his mindset had already shifted. Brushing the dust from his robe, he left the hall and began his own silent calculations.
As the others departed, only Li Chengliao and his son remained in the hall. At last, a trace of concern appeared on Li Chengliao’s face as he spoke softly, "There are two matters I must inform you of… First, the senior White Ape has entered seclusion to attempt a breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm."
"Hm?" Li Zhouwei was slightly taken aback. The White Ape had protected him since childhood, and he had deep feelings for it. Now hearing this news, he asked, "There likely isn’t an Essence Gathering Pill, is there?"
"Of course not." Li Chengliao sighed and replied, "This pill has long been controlled by Azure Pond. Even a powerful family like the Xiao Family must rely on connections within the sect to obtain it… When your granduncle made his breakthrough, he may not have even had this pill to aid him."
Li Zhouwei lowered his gaze slightly, but then saw Li Chengliao gather his thoughts and deliver an even greater piece of news. He said, "Your grandfather… has entered seclusion to attempt a breakthrough to Foundation Establishment Realm. Several of your uncles have already returned to witness it…"
Although Li Xicheng’s innate ability was not as high as his brothers’, he was more than ten years their senior. After years of tempering himself, he had long since reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Now, it seemed he had finally decided to attempt his breakthrough.
