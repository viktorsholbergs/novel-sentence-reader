"Moo~"
The big black ox let out a sound. Chen Xun's words made sense; in the world of cultivating immortality, there were countless spells to practice, an endless journey.
But in the eyes of the big black ox, there was a hint of joy. It had already made progress on the path of array formations and caught a glimpse of inspiration.
The two figures grew farther and farther away, disappearing outside the medicinal herb garden in the blink of an eye.
Today, the weather was gloomy, with drizzling rain falling. Many disciples quickened their pace, and even the whispers were much fewer.
Chen Xun led the big black ox to pass by them quietly. Raindrops fell on the faint glow of their magical shields, unable to get close.
"Old Ox, it's already late autumn when you calculate the time."
"Moo~"
They spoke softly, with a calm expression, as they walked past the roadside. The corners of their eyes glanced at the many indescribable scenes in the mountains. The leaves were falling everywhere, and the once lively scenes were no more.
After walking for an unknown time, Chen Xun led the big black ox to the residence of the law enforcement disciples. A wooden house was surrounded by people, all with a somber mood.
Le Feng had left quietly, like smoke dissipating with the wind—not even time for farewells.
Although many disciples found Senior Brother Le Feng too talkative and meddling, at the moment of his departure, countless people came to see him off.
"Old Ox, although we haven't interacted with him much, Senior Brother Le Feng was truly an impressive person."
"Moo? Moo!"
"Senior Brother Le Feng spent his entire life practicing for his ideals and has now achieved success."
Chen Xun looked at the overcast sky and happily arched his hand. "This is the Dao that Senior Brother Le Feng pursued, not the so-called realm of cultivating immortality..."
"Moo? Moo, moo~"
The big black ox also looked at the sky, not fully understanding but also happy for Senior Brother Le Feng.
Whether in the Nine Stars Valley or the Five Elements Sect, countless people were chasing after the elusive realms and powers.
Only Le Feng seemed to be chasing after those who were chasing. He urged his junior and junior sisters every day to cherish time without being swayed by longevity and benefits.
Chen Xun and the big black ox had seen too many people with average aptitude. Who would willingly accept their fate, even though they might have a carefree life in the mortal world?
Le Feng was just an ordinary cultivator with mediocre aptitude. He did insignificant tasks in the sect, receiving little appreciation. Sometimes, he was even secretly ridiculed and mocked by his disciples.
But Le Feng was destined to be a glimpse into the long years for Chen Xun and the big black ox.
They felt neither sorrow nor sadness, just like quietly appreciating a meteor falling from the sky—from prosperity to demise, and then to shattering.
A faint smile appeared at the corner of Chen Xun's mouth. His eyes seemed to have gained insight. It turned out that parting didn't necessarily bring only pain, sorrow, and regret. There was no need to deliberately avoid it; just let it be natural.
"Old Ox, let's go. Seeing so many people see him off, I feel at ease. Senior Brother Le Feng must also be comforted by this. What he did was meaningful."
"Moo, moo~"
They both had smiles in their eyes as they walked toward the Contribution Hall.
In the face of parting, heavy with resentment, easily withering away, and countless ruthless storms, the autumn rain was drizzling, and the two figures gradually disappeared in the misty rain.
In the distance, countless people didn't notice anyone passing by. The two figures seemed to leave no trace.
However, when they passed by a spiritual tree, their steps suddenly stopped. Their aura suddenly became extremely sharp, Chen Xun's mountain-opening axe trembled at his waist, and the big black ox's horns vibrated.
Their gazes seemed to be attracted, staring fixedly at this spiritual tree. Suddenly, they roared:
"He Ling Tree, Old Ox, what are you waiting for? Take action!"
"Moo~"
Boom, boom—
Boom, boom—
A huge dust cloud rose, and the two figures gradually disappeared. Only countless raindrops continued to hit the fallen He Ling Tree, making a patter-patter sound.
Inside the Contribution Hall, some elders felt a headache. Why did this junior bring the black ox spiritual beast again? Within these thirty years, if it weren't for the backup copies, all the minor spells in the sect would have been exchanged for nothing.
The key was that this junior was still tireless, like he had gone crazy. They couldn't persuade him. What use were these minor spells for Foundation Building stage cultivators?
However, today Chen Xun did not exchange minor spells but instead traded for some pill formulas for the Foundation Building stage. Many elders breathed a sigh of relief, indicating that this junior's interests had changed again.
They had inquired and knew that this junior managed the medicinal herb garden. They could understand his somewhat peculiar personality.
However, Chen Xun's true purpose was not to study those pill formulas but to exchange the formula for the 'Three Elements Pill.'
The Three Elements Pill greatly benefited the cultivation of mid-Foundation Building stage cultivators, but its toxicity was intense, and it should not be taken in excess. Chen Xun heard about this while assisting in the alchemy hall.
However, this formula was exceptionally expensive, requiring ten thousand contributions. But they were not in a hurry; they didn't want to arouse suspicion and invite unnecessary trouble.
Regarding the so-called toxicity, Chen Xun had researched it. It seemed that the pills he refined did not have this issue.
They had cultivated seeds for each medicinal herb in the herb garden and planted the same-year medicinal herbs. The grand array showed no reaction; they had thoroughly probed it.
Many of these medicinal herbs had unknown effects that were recognized only by sight. Still, they were sure that there were no such herbs in the pill formulas for the Foundation Building stage. It was better to be prepared.
Back at the medicinal herb garden, the grassy ground undulated continuously.
Chen Xun changed into a set of clothes and picked up a suona, and the big black ox was adorned with bells. They then lifted the coffin again.
"Old Ox, a sense of ceremony is essential in life. Following the highest etiquette of our small mountain village, let's send Senior Brother Le Feng off to ascend!"
"Moo, moo!"
As the words fell, a mournful sound of the suona echoed, and the big black ox violently shook the bells, starting the ritual. They looked solemn; such matters couldn't be treated lightly.
After a busy half-day, the departed were gone, and matters had reached this point. It was time to have a meal.
Carrying the mountain-opening axe, Chen Xun, along with the big black ox, went to the wild. The relieved birds in the medicinal herb garden watched them leave.
In the mountains, a series of loud, rumbling sounds echoed again. Disciples flying on their swords had their eyelids twitching, quickly avoiding the route so as not to disturb Senior Uncle who was logging.
Deep in the forest, giant trees have fallen everywhere. Chen Xun looked at the fallen He Ling Tree, sneered, and suddenly turned to ask, "Old Ox, do you still have any merit left?"
"Moo, moo?"
The big black ox was startled by Chen Xun's question, and a surge of spiritual energy emitted from its hooves, instantly bringing out the merit booklet they had prepared for years.
In Chen Xun's words, the big black ox was too casual with merit and needed to keep a record.
Its pupils dilated nervously, constantly flipping through the merit booklet. Sweat appeared on the ox's head, as if it had used up everything during the last ritual for the Qi Condensation stage, Senior Uncle.
"Moo, moo~" The big black ox kept making low sounds, looking at Chen Xun expectantly.
"Ah, it seems there's none left."
Chen Xun sighed softly. Suddenly, he remembered something. "Old Ox, we can only owe merits to the heavens and Buddha. Le Feng Senior Brother's matter is urgent."
"Moo? Moo, moo?"
"Of course, we can owe, but we must repay in the future. It's not easy for us to accumulate merits in the sect right now, and Buddha and the heavens will understand us."
"Moo!"
The big black ox stood up excitedly. Heaven and Buddha would surely forgive it. "Moo, moo~"
"Old Ox, set up the altar for the ritual. Le Feng Senior Brother will definitely have an extraordinary spiritual root in the next life—one day to Foundation Building, one month to Gold Core, invincible in the world!"
Chen Xun sat cross-legged on the ground, eyes slightly closed, chanting words, and spiritual energy quietly emerged. A faint green smoke surrounded him, becoming more and more professional.
"Moo!"
The big black ox forcefully exhaled, took out a censer, petals, and a few talismans from the storage bag. It moved around Chen Xun, continuously making low sounds, creating an atmosphere. It filled the surroundings.
They spent half a day in the forest. Chen Xun carried wood, and the big black ox carried wild beasts. Their eyes were filled with contentment as they returned to the medicinal herb garden.
The two guards outside the medicinal herb garden increasingly found it hard to understand them. This junior, Chen Xun, had absolutely no aura of a cultivator; he seemed entirely like an ordinary person.
As for his black ox spiritual beast, it was even more absurd. It had no appearance of a Foundation Building stage spiritual beast, resembling an old village ox.
