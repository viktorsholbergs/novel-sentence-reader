“Do I need to pay?” Lu Yang asked nervously, knowing the most valuable thing he owned was probably his intellect.
“Pay?” The senior brother glanced at the book in his hand and then at Lu Yang, his eye twitching sharply.
Technically, compensation in spirit stones was required, but this book’s exposure could draw the wrath of the dragon and phoenix clans from the Monster Realm, possibly leading to a direct conflict in the Central Continent and the Dao Seeking Sect.
While the sect wasn’t afraid of the two clans and knew that dragon’s liver and phoenix marrow can nourish one’s body, harboring such a book could tarnish its reputation as a righteous sect.
Considering this, the senior brother discreetly hid the book in his sleeve, appearing nonchalant. “Pay for what? You dirtied a book? I didn’t see anything.”
He decided it was better to dispose of the book outside the pavilion, as destroying it inside would trigger the protective formations.
Lu Yang quickly grasped the situation – the senior brother wanted to keep the book for himself. So, as far as they were concerned, nothing had happened.
They exchanged a glance as if they both shared a mutual understanding. The forbidden book was a mere episode, and Lu Yang didn’t forget his original purpose in the Scripture Pavilion.
He finally found the book he was looking for – “Treatise on the Land of the Central Continent.” Excited, he began to read attentively.
“The world is home to humans, monsters, ghosts, and more. The Central Continent is a hub for humans, dominated by the Great Xia Dynasty, the only nation there, embodying the human race’s orthodoxy.”
“Honestly speaking, although my house is near the Dao Seeking Sect, it is considered part of the Great Xia Dynasty.”
“To the east of the continent lies a vast ocean dotted with islands, occasionally visited by ancient beasts like Kun Peng.”
“To the west is the Golden Buddha Country, a land of infinite pure lands and numerous temples.”
“To the south lies the Monster Realm, ruled by the dragon and phoenix clans, where cruel and bloodthirsty monsters constantly clash with the Great Xia Dynasty.”
“To the north is the frigid Northland, where sparse life endures in the harsh environment, and only the strongest survive.”
“The Central Continent, with its multitude of humans and cultivators, is where many choose to serve in the court or establish sects and schools, including the Dao Seeking Sect and the other four major Immortal Sects, the leaders of righteousness.”
“The book also mentions that each of the five major Immortal Sects likely has a Tribulation Crossing stage powerhouse or possesses equivalent power… Could it be that the Sect Leader is such a powerhouse, or is there a hidden elder in my Dao Seeking Sect?”
Considering he might be apprenticed to such a powerhouse, Lu Yang felt a surge of excitement. He got up to pour a cup of water, using the act to calm his excitement before sitting back down to continue reading.
“The demonic cultivators, who grow their power by sacrificing lives, are even more dangerous than the monsters. Hiding in dark corners, they dare not reveal themselves due to the combined suppression of the Great Xia Dynasty and the five major Immortal Sects.”
Apart from demonic cultivators, the book vaguely mentions ‘evil demons,’ describing them as heartless beings born from the shadows of humanity, advising to steer clear of them.
“Civilians use gold, silver, and copper as currency, while cultivators use upper, middle, and lower-grade spirit stones.”
Lu Yang then delved into common knowledge of the cultivation world, like the criteria for various cultivation stages, the types of magical arts, types of magical beasts, levels of cultivation techniques, and the history of the Central Continent…
His knowledge, gained from storytellers in teahouses, was insufficient for survival in the cultivation world.
Lu Yang, immersed in profound knowledge, only realized he hadn’t eaten all day when he felt hunger pangs in the evening.
At the Scripture Pavilion’s entrance, a senior sister had replaced the senior brother. Lu Yang respectfully asked, “Excuse me, Senior Sister, I’m new and unfamiliar with the Dao Seeking Sect. Is there a place to eat here?”
The senior sister, startled by Lu Yang’s approach and avoiding eye contact due to her shyness, whispered, “You’re new? There is a dining hall, but as a senior, I advise against eating there.”
Lu Yang, puzzled, asked, “Why? Is there something wrong with the dining hall?”
“It’s located on the Hundred Refinements Peak under the Fifth Elder.”
Lu Yang was taken aback, as the name didn’t sound like a place for cooking: “May I ask what Hundred Refinements Peak is?”
“Fifth Elder specializes in weapon forging, so Hundred Refinements Peak is naturally for that purpose. The dining hall’s chefs are top-tier weapon forgers. Their buns can break mountains, rice grains can be used as hidden weapons, and their deep-fried dough sticks can even smash steel.”
Lu Yang was speechless: “…Why are chefs also weapon forgers?”
The senior sister explained softly, “Consider this, both professions value precise control of heat. They’re more closely related than you think.”
Lu Yang nodded earnestly: “Indeed, closer than I thought.”
Noting Lu Yang’s simple attire, the senior sister hesitated, then mentioned: “Also, eating at the dining hall requires spirit stones, and you don’t seem to have many.”
Lu Yang’s clothes, unlike typical cultivators’ garments made from materials like heavenly silkworm silk, were simple and patched, clearly indicating his mortal origins.
Lu Yang smiled awkwardly, having no spirit stones.
“Don’t feel bad; there are many disciples from mortal backgrounds,” she reassured softly.
“There’s another way to eat. You could visit Pellet Cauldron Peak. They might have discarded Fasting Pills, which you can ask for.”
“Pellet Cauldron Peak has high standards for pills. Discarded ones are just not of high quality but are still safe to consume.”
“But be careful around the Seventh Elder, Senior Brother Wu Ming, Senior Brother Wen Da, Senior Sister Qing Kong, Junior Brother Long Yan… just be cautious in general.”
Lu Yang, puzzled but grateful, thanked her: “I’m Lu Yang. Thank you, Senior Sister. May I know your name?”
“I’m Zhou Lulu.”
