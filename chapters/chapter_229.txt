Li Tongya took the main seat in the courtyard, with members of the Li Family sitting neatly below him. Everyone wore joyful expressions, chatting and laughing heartily with one another.
Li Tongya smiled gently from his position at the head of the table, with Li Xuanfeng at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm on his left, and Li Xuanxuan at the second heavenly layer on his right. Below them sat Li Xuanling and Chen Donghe, and at the bottom were Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanyun. Together, they spoke in unison.
"Congratulations, Second Uncle/Father/Granduncle, on successfully establishing your immortal foundation!"
Li Tongya nodded and said with a smile, "During my seclusion this time, I've formed the Boundless Ocean and advanced to the Foundation Establishment Realm… Our family is now a clan and consequent changes must be made."
After saying these words, he then looked at Li Xuanxuan and asked, "Xuan'er, how have things been on the lake these years?"
Li Xuanxuan stood up and cupped his hands respectfully before replying, "Second Uncle, you were only in seclusion for a month when a geological upheaval struck the Milin Prefecture. It caused the ground to crack, towns to collapse, and it left Yu Mugao at a loss. Soon after, the three main roads leading out of Milin Prefecture were attacked. Relay stations and narrow passes were targeted, people were killed, roads were destroyed, and the mountain passes were blocked. Yu Mugao was furious but had to handle things alone. The younger generation of the Yu Family is hardly promising, and Yu Mujian remains in seclusion… Do you remember the one who harmed Yuanxiu?"
Li Tongya nodded slowly. That person was clever, quickly using others' corpses to create diversions and disposing of two storage pouches to prevent giving resources to enemies. Knowing escape was impossible, he had used talismans to destroy his own body.
Quite a feat, indeed.
Li Xuanxuan nodded and continued, "That man, Yu Muyuan, was Yu Mugao's capable assistant—keen and decisive… With Yu Muyuan gone, Yu Mugao is now overwhelmed and struggling. The next year, before the market in Milin Prefecture could be fully restored, a rogue cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Realm arrived among the families on the eastern shore, previously considered the Yu Family's exclusive domain. He seemed intent on establishing a clan, stirring discontent among the Qi Cultivation Realm families, which left Yu Mugao with a severe headache."
Li Tongya nodded and murmured, "This must be Fei Wangbai's doing… Yu Mugao is ruthless and cunning, but now he's completely overwhelmed, rendering him unable to be the usual troublemaker."
The others nodded in agreement as Li Yuanjiao clenched his fists, sighing bitterly. Li Tongya then continued, "It's always easier to harm than to defend. If the foundation of one's rule is unstable and the larger the territory, the more challenging it would be to control."
Li Xuanxuan nodded and brought Li Yuanping and Li Qingxiao forward. Li Qingxiao looked adorable with her rosy cheeks, and she greeted each elder.
Li Yuanping was similar in age but appeared much smaller, still needing to be held by Li Xuanxuan's first wife. He seemed timid and was too afraid to speak.
Li Tongya first pulled Li Qingxiao closer and stroked her head for a while, before taking Li Yuanping from Li Xuanxuan, frowning slightly.
Li Xuanxuan raised his head guiltily while his wife slowly lifted her head and spoke softly, "When I was pregnant with Ping'er, it was right when Xiu'er had his accident… It led to a premature birth, leaving him weak and showing signs of congenital deficiency."
Li Tongya first raised an eyebrow at her and praised, "Xiangping and I arranged the marriage with you and Xuanxuan back when because we admired your dignity and resourcefulness… You have spent these years in the family residence, helping Xuanxuan a lot, and your cultivation has now reached the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."
"Second Uncle, you're too kind," the woman nodded meekly, handing the child to Li Tongya who inspected him carefully. He performed a series of hand seals, and almost immediately, a pleasant fragrance wafted through the air which attracted everyone's attention.
Li Yuanping looked up at Li Tongya innocently as small crystal-like particles appeared in mid-air, twirling around in the air as before entering his little mouth. Li Yuanping smacked his lips and let out a soft hum.
Li Tongya stopped casting the spell, and with Li Xuanxuan and his wife watching him expectantly, he shook his head and explained, "All it does is replenish some vitality. With innate essence missing, only a divine ability can restore it fully…"
The woman took Li Yuanping back quietly and bowed before retreating from the room. Li Xuanxuan lowered his head and murmured, "That's good enough."
Li Tongya glanced at everyone's faces and said warmly, "Since I've broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, there are a few matters that need to be scheduled."
"Donghe."
Chen Donghe took a step forward as Li Tongya continued, "You should visit the Xiao Family and deliver the news. Don't go empty-handed; bring some spirit items from the clan, though they need not be too valuable… spirit items suitable for the Qi Cultivation Realm will suffice."
"Understood!" Chen Donghe responded respectfully and quickly left the courtyard, heading down the mountain.
Only then did Li Tongya turn back and say softly, "Elder Xiao Chuchou of the Xiao Family and I once had an agreement that if I broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, our families would form a closer alliance through an arranged marriage. If I failed, the agreement would end. Now that my immortal foundation is established, the marriage shall be arranged."
Everyone's faces changed, revealing mixed emotions. Li Xuanfeng cupped his fist and said, "This marriage arrangement will be fine if we are to wed someone. All of the Yuan generation is of age, but if we are to marry someone off, only Qinghong is of suitable age..."
Li Xuanling, being Li Qinghong's biological father, grew increasingly anxious. "Absolutely not! Qinghong has been bestowed with the talisman seed, and her talent is the highest among the generations of Yuan and Qing. How could we have her marry into another family?" he protested earnestly.
Li Xuanxuan shook his head, equally troubled. "Indeed, it is not possible… But the Xiao Family is wealthy and influential, and their willingness to arrange a marriage with our family is already a sign of respect. They would never agree to have someone from their side marry into ours! Bringing in a husband is certainly out of the question, and Qinghong cannot be married off either!" he added with a frown.
Li Tongya shook his head, setting the tone of the conversation before continuing, "Although the marriage has yet to be finalized, our family's power is weak. Logically, it makes sense to marry a daughter into their family… There is actually a solution to this."
He took a sip of tea and continued, "We can have our legitimate son marry their concubine-born daughter. Such a compromise is enough and should satisfy the Xiao Family."
"You're right, Second Uncle!" Li Xuanxuan agreed, then continued, "One more matter has yet to be reported—The Yu Family used our family as an excuse to kill off many members of the An Family and installed a puppet to make them a vassal. An Jingming is dead, and only An Zheyan managed to escape. He fled to our household and has now joined our clan, offering several techniques and spells."
"An Zheyan…" Li Tongya hummed, pausing for a brief moment.
"Let him come up and see me."
Everyone immediately nodded in agreement. After chatting a bit more, they all took their leave. Some went back to drawing talismans while others returned to their cultivation practice, each becoming busy with their own tasks.
