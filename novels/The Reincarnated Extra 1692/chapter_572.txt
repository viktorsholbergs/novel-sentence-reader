【Beautiful Girl Detective Akashiterika!】The Old Imperial City Frozend Museum Murder Case 10
* * *
DOGOOOOOON!!!
Behind her, Steel Index exploded.
Akashiterika was pushed by the blast.
Until then, she had been fighting with all her might… no, beyond her limits, thanks to the Superbad Divine Jeweled Crown, but in reality, she was completely exhausted.
Now that the enemy has been defeated, and the crown’s support has ceased, she can barely stand.
Pushed by the intense wind pressure, she swayed.
Akashiterika fell face-first onto the floor… and then—
“You’re always so reckless…”
Her body was lifted and held in strong arms, accompanied by a slightly angry voice.
It’s Director Rakigataa.
“The Superbad Divine Jeweled Crown is a double-edged sword. It grants the user supernatural power, but the backlash is strong. There have even been emperors who died because of it. You know that, don’t you? Your father, your mother, and your older brother are all worried about you. And so am I. I’d prefer it if you didn’t push yourself so hard…”
Director Rakigataa, kneeling on one knee, supporting Akashiterika’s body with both arms, went on and on.
“…It’s been a while since I’ve been lectured by the director.”
Akashiterika, ignoring his lecture, smiled and said that.
Director Rakigataa, seeing that smile, his anger seemingly dissipating, opened his mouth, and then shook his head.
“Well… however.”
And then, turning up the corners of his mouth slightly, he looked around and said—
“Thanks to Akashiterika-sama, everyone was saved… gufufu, thank you.”
Around them, the police officers who came as backup were carrying the injured police officers on stretchers, and extinguishing the flames caused by Steel Index’s explosion with water magic.
Although there are many injured, it seems that no one died.
On the other side, Jimmyyak, who caused Steel Index to go berserk, was being pulled out of the wall.
Although he’s unconscious, he’s still alive.
A harsh interrogation awaits him.
The Restorationists will suffer a great loss.
“Everyone was saved…? No, not yet…!”
But Akashiterika’s expression tightened, she pulled away from Director Rakigataa’s arms, and stood up, trembling.
“Emi… Emi is missing. She protected us, and fell into the sewer… I have to save her…!”
Muttering that.
Staggering.
Akashiterika took one step at a time, towards the large hole in the entrance hall.
But.
“Guh… !?”
The next moment, a sharp pain shot through Akashiterika’s body!
It’s the backlash from using the Superbad Jeweled Crown!
Her body, pushed beyond its limits, is screaming!
“You can’t push yourself any further! Leave the rest to the police!”
Director Rakigataa, catching Akashiterika, who was about to collapse again, shouted.
“No… I can’t… I’m the envoy of justice, who will not tolerate injustice…”
But Akashiterika, with her weakened strength, struggled to escape from Director Rakigataa’s grasp.
Director Rakigataa, seeing that… involuntarily raised his voice.
“Forget your pride as a detective! Akashiterika-sama, your body is at its limit!”
Akashiterika, sternly rebuked by Director Rakigataa, widened her eyes.
However.
Akashiterika, still, tried to pull away from Director Rakigataa, and move forward.
“No… That’s not it… I want to save her. Not because I’m a detective, but because I…”
And then, tears streaming down her face—
“Because I’m… Emi’s friend…”
She muttered that, and finally—
Lost consciousness.
Director Rakigataa, holding Akashiterika’s limp body, exhaled deeply.
Before him is the large hole.
The sound of rushing water is echoing from the bottom.
“…………”
Director Rakigataa, holding Akashiterika, stood up, and started walking, to take her to the hospital.
Turning his back to the hole.
Now, Arc 24, which has been long…
From the … finally!
The final battle!!!
I apologize to those of you who thought ‘Isn’t it over yet? Isn’t this the epilogue?’… but it continues.
However, although it’s the final battle, it won’t be intense, and I plan to end it quickly.
I hope you’ll continue to enjoy it.
