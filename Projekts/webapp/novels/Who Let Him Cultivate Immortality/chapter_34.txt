Chapter 34: The Little Medicine Kings
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
“I once roamed the Central Continent, making a significant name for myself,” reminisced the ginseng child. “If it weren’t for someone revealing my effects as an aphrodisiac, forcing me to seek refuge in the Dao Seeking Sect, I would still be traveling.”
“The person who traveled with me is also a notable figure among your human race, known as Householder Ancient Moon. (TL Note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Householder_(Buddhism))When he brought me to the Dao Seeking Sect, he mentioned writing about me in his book so that people would remember me.”
Householder Ancient Moon was a famous traveler in the Central Continent. He loved exploring and had adventures in the Central Continent, the Demonic Realm, the Buddhist Lands, and more, leaving his mark and tales in each place.
According to legend, he was a historian in the Xia Dynasty, detailing the Emperor’s romantic escapades and his numerous illegitimate children.
In the Demonic Realm, he was abducted by a Dragon Princess and forced into marriage, which he fled from, leading to a pursuit that ended in the Buddhist Lands.
In the Buddhist Lands, he masqueraded as a monk, deceiving people. Whenever he was caught in a logical fallacy or faced an unsolvable question, he would reply with “Buddha says it’s unspeakable.” This phrase later became widely known in the Buddhist Lands.
The Householder Ancient Moon compiled his observations and experiences into books that were quite popular in the cultivation world.
Although there is no clear record of Householder Ancient Moon’s cultivation level, Lu Yang presumed it must be high – otherwise, he would have long been defeated.
The ginseng child was an excellent teacher, sharing many stories from its experiences, including several herbs in the garden discovered during its travels with Householder Ancient Moon. Lu Yang listened intently, fascinated by the tales.
As they reached a hut made of plants and flowers, Lu Yang felt an almost tangible life force emanating from it, causing his heart to race.
“Not right!” Lu Yang clutched his chest as his body uncontrollably trembled.
His heart beat faster and faster, as if numerous insects were buzzing in his ears. Listening closely, Lu Yang realized those weren’t insect sounds but voices inside his body, clamoring to escape.
The ginseng child, noticing Lu Yang’s distress, loudly cautioned, “Hey, hey, hey, we have an outsider here. Everyone, tone down your life force, quickly!”
Lu Yang calmed his boiling blood through his cultivation practice, and the voices gradually faded.
He knelt on the ground, gasping for breath, realizing that what he experienced wasn’t an illusion. Something was indeed inside him. But what was it?
The ginseng child, putting down a piece of ethereal stone, apologized to Lu Yang. “Sorry about that. I didn’t realize you hadn’t reached the Nascent Soul stage yet.”
Unlike humans, the age of Medicine Kings, not their cultivation level, is what matters. The ginseng child couldn’t discern Lu Yang’s cultivation level but found him agreeable.
“What just happened?” Lu Yang asked, still shaken as if he had just returned from a trip through hell.
“The woman and Old Ba from your race have too high cultivation levels, making me overlook the impact of our life force on you,” the ginseng child explained.
“Our life force is so robust that it can cause each of your organs to develop their own will and become separate entities. Once you reach the Nascent Soul stage, with your acupoints fully developed and a leak-proof golden body, you’ll no longer be affected by our life force.”
Hearing the ginseng child’s commotion, numerous three-inch-tall herbs hopped over to Lu Yang.
“King Ginseng, is this a human? Why is he so small?”
“What do you mean ‘so small’? He’s the same height as us. Are you saying you’re small too?”
“It’s definitely some technique. Human’s techniques are mysterious. What’s so special about changing size?. I’ve even seen people changing from male to female, and human to demon. It’s nothing unusual. I’ve seen it all,” the ginseng child said.
“This human doesn’t seem to have a high cultivation level, not even reaching the ‘Pregnant Phase’?”
“It’s not ‘Pregnant Phase’, Qilin King, your memory is failing you. It’s called the ‘Nascent Soul Phase’.”
“He looks like he can’t even stand properly. Let’s carry him into the house.”
The Little Medicine Kings discussed among themselves in hushed tones, creating a buzzing discomfort in Lu Yang’s ears. They lifted Lu Yang above their heads and carried him into the hut made of flowers and plants.
The King of Understanding Trees stood outside, scratching its trunk, causing leaves to rustle loudly. It was too big to enter the hut.
Once inside, Lu Yang realized it wasn’t just a hut made of flowers and plants but one constructed from ancient woods. Under the influence of the Little Medicine Kings’ life force, the ancient woods blossomed with new leaves and flowers, concealing their original appearance.
Lu Yang felt much better. He slowly got up and began to recognize the Medicine Kings around him.
As it turned out, he didn’t recognize a single one.
“What’s your name, human?” asked a small plant with three tender leaves, shimmering silver with speckles of starlight, resembling a miniature universe.
“I am Lu Yang, may I know who you are…?” Lu Yang politely inquired, understanding that these Little Medicine Kings were not just his seniors but ancestors to everyone in the Dao Seeking Sect.
“That’s the Three-Leaf Star Medicine; we call it Star King,” interjected another Medicine King swiftly. It was a colorful flower with petals corresponding to the five elements and a center divided into black and white. The center resembled Tai Chi, creating an ink painting-like beauty that captivated anyone who saw it.
“I am the Flower of Time’s End, just call me End King. Everyone says I’m the most beautiful flower. I think it’s just envy of my charm, a way to kill me with praise. As a humble Medicine King, I consider myself the second most beautiful in the world…” The Flower of Time’s End rambled on and on.
Lu Yang stared at the Flower of Time’s End for a couple of seconds, his pupils dilating with disbelief. He might not know the appearance of the Flower of Time’s End, but he had heard of its grand reputation.
“The Flower of Time’s End, is it really the flower that blooms only when the world ends, causing time to freeze with its beauty?!”
It was no wonder Lu Yang reacted so dramatically. According to ancient texts, the blooming of the Flower of Time’s End was tantamount to the end of the world, essentially reshuffling everything.
Yet, according to historical records, such a cataclysmic event had never occurred!
The Flower of Time’s End scratched its nectar glands and remarked, “Well, some say that. But I remember blooming peacefully, with everyone happily around me. I didn’t see any disaster. It’s probably just a rumor about my blooming.”
Just as Lu Yang was about to inquire further, another Little Medicine King spoke up.
“Lu Yang, why have you come to the Medicine Garden? Did Old Ba send you to pick herbs?” a small emerald Qilin asked, carved as if from fine jade, exquisite and otherworldly.
Another shock for Lu Yang. “A Qilin?!”
A qilin, one of the most mystical beasts, so rare that the entire world might not have one or two. Only ancient texts hinted at their existence, and the Dao Seeking Sect had one?
The depths of the Dao Seeking Sect’s heritage were far beyond Lu Yang’s imagination.
The ginseng child explained, “It’s the Qilin Immortal Medicine. Its current form is its magical manifestation. With your current cultivation, you can’t see its true form. Once you reach the Divine Spirit Stage and cultivate the Heavenly Eye, you’ll be able to see its true body.”
