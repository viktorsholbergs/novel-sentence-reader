Li Qinghong had just arrived at the courtyard when she noticed a female cultivator standing quietly there, holding the hand of a little girl. Her face was veiled with spirit gauze. Upon seeing Li Qinghong, she greeted him with a warm smile.
"You're here, Qinghong!"
The woman, Xiao Guiluan, appeared to be in her twenties despite her actual age being over forty. It was no surprise as the Xiao Family was an immortal clan and she was at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
"Hello, Sister-In-Law," Li Qinghong replied with a gentle nod as a smile involuntarily appeared on her face. The generations of Yuan and Qing were all very close to each other. Xiao Guiluan, both tactful and capable, had always maintained a harmonious relationship with her in-laws.
The little girl, Li Yuexiang, was Li Yuanjiao's youngest daughter. She affectionately hugged Li Qinghong and called her auntie sweetly.
"Have you been studying well, Yuexiang?" Li Qinghong asked gently.
Xiao Guiluan turned to Li Qinghong with a smile and asked, "You've reached the eighth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm at just forty-two or forty-three, right?"
"That's correct," she responded with a nod.
"You might establish your foundation by fifty then… you truly are a prodigy," Xiao Guiluan praised.
The later stages of Qi Cultivation demanded substantial time, often at least five years. Unfamiliar with talisman pills, Xiao Guiluan estimated that Li Qinghong would reach the Foundation Establishment by fifty. However, Li Qinghong herself believed that she could achieve it by forty-five.
The women conversed for a bit before Li Qinghong frowned and said, "I don't understand why my brother went into seclusion without saying a word… It's unlike him."
Xiao Guiluan shook her head and began, "In the Xiao Family history, out of 376 Qi Cultivators breaking through to Foundation Establishment, 170 did so abruptly, without prior notice. When one's spiritual energy is ripe, unless suppressed by secret techniques from immortal sects, it's often best to break through immediately."
Li Qinghong furrowed her brow, prompting further explanation from Xiao Guiluan.
"Our elders are baffled too. After years of investigation, they learned of a rumor circulating among the three sects that may be tied to the activity of Metallic Essence. Within the same Dao lineage, it's common for several members to establish the same immortal foundation within a few years. Yet, curiously, after some more years, several among them may fail..."
Li Qinghong nodded gently, her keen intellect evident as her eyes lit up. She then spoke thoughtfully, "Mastering the activities of Metallic Essence could significantly enhance the chances of our disciples' breakthroughs. If one could cultivate Metallic Essence effectively then that means..."
They could control the Dao lineage at will? To determine who achieves breakthrough...
She suddenly fell silent and looked at Xiao Guiluan, only to notice a subtle shift in her expression. The two exchanged a silent, knowing look.
No wonder the prestigious clans of the Xu State were decimated by a reincarnated being... Just the sight of a hint of Metallic Essence instills terror in anyone...
The two stood quietly in the courtyard, listening to the soft flowing sound of spring water flowing nearby. Xiao Guiluan continued in a gentle voice, "Those are probably just false rumors… In the ancient texts, no sect within the first three hundred years has mentioned any Dao lineage that could control foundation establishment."
Looking at the shimmering water ripples in the cave dwelling while engaging in their speculative conversation, they were startled by a sudden loud explosion.
BOOM!
The sky outside the courtyard burst into a brilliant display, with clouds turning a radiant gold. Streams of light danced through the air as numerous mana lights streaked across the sky. Li Qinghong looked up and swiftly ascended, riding the wind upward.
The golden lights in the sky merged into the distant red hues of sunset and the brilliance in the east shone intensely for several moments before gradually fading away.
More mana lights appeared, belonging to cultivators of various sizes and colors, all converging toward the east.
Li Qinghong hovered and observed for a moment before a cultivator in the early stages of the Qi Cultivation Realm approached. Li Qinghong stopped him with her spear raised, prompting a look of annoyance from the man. However, upon recognizing her advanced cultivation realm at the eighth heavenly layer, he quickly softened his tone.
"What assistance may I offer, fairy?" he asked.
"If I may inquire, fellow Daoist… What is happening in the east?" Li Qinghong asked.
The cultivator, impatient yet respectful, responded swiftly, "Senior must have been in seclusion for a long while. This spectacle marks the collapse of a grotto heaven, likely the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven in Yufu Prefecture that has been the recent talks. If you're heading there, perhaps you could bring me along."
"Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven?" Li Qinghong pondered aloud.
Li Xuanxuan often relayed the news from Kong Yu to everyone in the family. When Li Qinghong learned that the disturbance originated from Yufu Prefecture, she shook her head slightly and quickly made up an excuse.
"This sounds too good to be true! The three sects and seven gates have probably claimed everything… As long as the grotto heaven's forbidden mechanisms remain intact, we are just pawns being used as scouts."
The rogue cultivator shook his head and replied, "You must be joking, Senior! How could we simply enter the grotto heaven? The spiritual energy released upon its fall scattered various essences like spiritual qi, spirit water, and spirit fire across Mount Dongli. There's plenty to go around for those who simply wish to gather spirit materials and depart."
Li Qinghong frowned slightly but allowed him to pass. Xiao Guiluan caught up and gazed toward the east, then explained, "It must be Chu Yi, the Li Fire Spear, who opened the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven… That incident had indeed caused quite a stir. Judging by the date, this was expected."
Puzzled, Li Qinghong asked, "Where did this Li Fire Spear come from? I've never heard of this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."
For someone like Li Qinghong who had a passion for spears, it seemed improbable that she would be unaware of a notable spear-wielding Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.
Xiao Guiluan explained, "You may not know, Qinghong, but this person only rose to fame recently. He received the legacy of the Dongli Sect at a young age and achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm by thirty-one and is considered a top-tier genius."
"Chu Yi was originally a rogue cultivator from Yufu Prefecture. After his legacy was exposed, he was framed by the Han Family of the local clans. Within just a few years, he achieved a breakthrough and eliminated two Foundation Establishment Realm ancestors in Jiangnan. His reputation has resonated throughout the region, earning him the nickname Li Fire Spear."
She paused briefly before adding, "Now, all of Jiangnan is aware that he has the legacy of Dongli Sect… It's also widely rumored that he will soon enter the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven."
After absorbing this information, Li Qinghong mused internally, Such a genius! He must be a True Monarch...
As she contemplated this, an elderly man with a wrinkled face and white hair ascended hastily. His expression was anxious as he called out, "Hong'er, you must not go!"
Li Qinghong flew toward him and smiled reassuringly.
"Uncle, you worry too much! Qinghong is not one to be blinded by greed," she replied.
Xiao Guiluan also approached, respectfully greeting the man.
"Father!"
Li Xuanxuan sighed softly and said, "Indeed, you are not one to act rashly, but you'll never know if any divine ability is at play. I fear you might be led astray, just like Yu Yufeng was."
With concern on his face, he continued, "The moment I heard Chu Yi is Li Fire Spear, I was shocked. Despite all the news we've received, we never dared to interrupt your seclusion..."
The three then descended and seated themselves in the courtyard. Xiao Guiluan brought Li Yuexiang away as Li Xuanxuan continued speaking.
"As Guiluan mentioned, this Wander Fire Spear, Chu Yi, is likely the True Monarch awaited by the Azure Pond Sect. The Han Family's actions are merely a repeat of what the Kong Family faced."
"Outside of the three sects, seven gates, and a few immortal clans, most other families remain in the dark, clueless about the current state of affairs..." he added after a brief pause.
Li Qinghong stared at the mana light streaking across the sky, shaking her head skeptically.
"You're saying those are disciples from the three sects and seven gates that are heading there? Those lights seem enhanced by their escape spells... I don't think there are so many clans practicing escape spells…"
Li Xuanxuan paused when she said this, observing intently. Realizing that Li Qinghong was right, he grew puzzled too.
"But Kong Yu didn't look like he was lying," he said with a frown.
