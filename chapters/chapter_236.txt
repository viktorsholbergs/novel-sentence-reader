The evening wind swept through the mountains, drifting through the forests of Azure Pond Peak before reaching Chi Wei on the mountaintop. His white hair fluttered in the breeze, and his wrinkled eyes squinted.
He reached out to touch his face. He could have used a younger visage, but after living for hundreds of years, Chi Wei no longer cared about beauty… or ugliness.
Scattered figures stood among the clouds. Chi Wei's reputation was not as prominent as Duanmu Kui's, but Purple Mansion Realm cultivators from the three states of Yue, Wu, and Xu still came to observe him.
Standing behind him was Chi Zhiyun, his face full of sorrow and reluctance. He watched Chi Wei's moon-white patterned robe fluttering in the wind and said softly, "Ancestor, the matters in the sect have been resolved…"
Chi Wei remained silent, standing on the mountaintop, facing the evening breeze while he reminisced. He smiled and said, "Zhiyun, what do you think of this man named Chi Wei?"
Chi Zhiyun was puzzled but cupped his fist respectfully and answered, "The ancestor is the cornerstone of the Azure Pond Sect… With immense power, he dominates an era, learned beyond mortal comprehension, profound as a deep pool, and possessing extraordinary bearing…"
Chi Wei laughed heartily and shook his head as he heard this, then waved his hand. "Dominating an era? I cannot compare with Duanmu Kui and Li Jiangqun. As for being learned beyond mortal comprehension, that is nonsense! I am not even a match for that old flood dragon and am inferior to both Xiao Xianyou and Tang Yuanwu," he replied rather bitterly.
He paused, his expression thoughtful and his gaze sharp. He laughed, "...And as for being profound as a deep pool, I'm nowhere near Xiao Chuting."
"Xiao Chuting?!"
Chi Zhiyun searched his memory for this name before finally recalling it, leaving him stunned. He mumbled, "Xiao Chuting… Xiao Chuting… from the Xiao Family in Lixia."
Chi Zhiyun wasn't stupid. He looked up abruptly and exclaimed, "Xiao Chuting has broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm?!"
"Hmm…" Chi Wei smiled broadly, then nodded toward a point in the clouds.
Chi Zhiyun mumbled in disbelief, "How could that be?! How did he obtain Purple Mansion Realm techniques, let alone find secret divine abilities… or even have the courage to do so?!"
"Courage…" Chi Wei chuckled hoarsely, "Do not think of Azure Pond Sect as some superior sect that treats all beings like pawns. The world is full of talents scrambling to climb up like fish crossing the river. For the Azure Pond Sect to hold its current position…"
Chi Wei paused, sighing.
"It is like sitting on a hot pan over burning coals!"
Chi Zhiyun simply stuttered, unable to speak, and Chi Wei continued, "You young ones have grown up hearing my name, believing me to be a hero who dominated an era…"
"Is that not true?!" Chi Zhiyun protested indignantly, saying firmly, "You prevented the calamity, drove away the demons, swept across the southern border, and eliminated the monsters… Ancestor, you have saved millions of people. Even if tens of thousands were sacrificed for your cultivation, so what? These people should remember that without our protection, they would not be alive…"
"Humph!" Chi Wei scoffed, shaking his head, "I am but a petty man. From the age of seventeen, when I stole Li Jiangqun's pouch, to now… at 377 years old, swallowing human pills to extend my life… it is all the behavior of a scoundrel! Shameful to behold!"
"I borrowed Li Jiangqun's influence and collaborated with various sects to eradicate two gates. I destroyed Lingyu, and eliminated Xiao Xianyou. Every year, I harvested families and refined the disciples who absorbed the foundation of moonlight… The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have all seen this," Chi Wei said as he looked up and smiled, calling out to the dark night sky.
"Everyone above can hear me clearly… Tell me, does that not make me a scoundrel?!"
In the sky, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators looked at each other with varying expressions. Some sighed softly, some sneered in disdain, while others hummed coldly.
After a while, a cool female voice spoke, "If you are not a scoundrel, then who else is worthy of the name?"
"You!" Chi Zhiyun was enraged but remained silent, wary of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators above. Chi Wei simply nodded with a smile. The sunrise was already on the horizon, but he stood still.
The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators also watched him silently. They had all lived for at least a century and were in no rush—at least not as much as Chi Wei was.
The rising sun gradually illuminated the world as pure qi floated upward and murky qi sank. The essence of the sun and moon blended harmoniously, creating the perfect conditions for a breakthrough. Divine light began to rise from Chi Wei's body, and his expression remained calm.
As the celestial energy of the sun and moon reached its peak, Chi Wei's spiritual sense activated. A faint glow flew out from his Shenyang Mansion—his divine ability, Heavy Murk—now in full effect.
Chi Wei took a step forward, and his vision cleared. Two indistinct figures appeared among the clouds. Chi Wei laughed heartily and called out, "So, you two are here to collect my remains!"
The two figures had long grown accustomed to the varied scenes of Purple Mansion Realm breakthroughs and hence were not offended by his jest. One of them laughed sharply and called out to him.
"Chi Wei… your day has finally come!"
Chi Wei waved indifferently as his appearance grew increasingly youthful and handsome, but there was still a sinister air about him. Four more divine abilities flew out from his body, stirring up the spiritual qi of the heavens and earth that danced around him.
The five divine abilities combined into one radiant light, weaving together and transforming into five colors: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. They merged and soared, and one figure from above muttered, "He's using the Five Elements Command Metal Technique…"
Chi Wei flicked his fingers, and a pill appeared in his hand, radiating colorful light and emitting a rich fragrance. Its brilliance illuminated the surroundings, and the observers above craned their necks, murmuring in curiosity.
"Oh?"
The two indistinct figures noticed this phenomenon as well. One of them asked sharply, "What kind of pill is that?"
The other squinted and replied softly, "Judging by its appearance, it should be Lake Moon Autumn."
"Indeed."
The first figure, after examining Chi Wei's other immortal foundations, laughed and said, "That is also a viable method!"
Chi Wei put the pill into his mouth and waited for a few breaths, but only felt faint movement. Panic set in, and his expression shifted rapidly. He was clearly going through a range of emotions. Anger and fear appeared on his face as he shouted in anger, "Old flood dragon! How dare you deceive me with a fake pill?!"
The five-colored light drawn by the divine ability continued to burn, gathering into a bright point of light. The two indistinct figures above snickered in unison. "Chi Wei! You've been swindled!"
All the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators widened their eyes, pointing at the glowing light. Chi Wei quickly adjusted his mindset and sighed with closed eyes. He pushed his palm forward, summoning the essence of the sun and moon to pour into the light.
Five bright and light-colored beams gradually emerged above the light, floating downward before slowly fading away. The light point grew brighter while the colored beams vanished.
"Indeed, not as good as Duanmu Kui…"
Those above exchanged thoughts through their spiritual senses, while the two indistinct figures in the sky prepared their techniques, awaiting the emergence of the metallic essence.
