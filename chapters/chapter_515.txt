Li Xizhi recalled the records he had read in the sect and said softly, "I have studied Golden Tang Gate thoroughly. There are many secrets revolving around it. He had probably joined the Azure Pond after his lineage was destroyed because he had no other choice… It's no surprise for them to raise an orphan to preserve the lineage. Situ Mo should be the son of Situ Yi. As the survivor of his lineage, it's understandable that he would be valued."
Li Xuanxuan interjected quietly, "If that's the case, he will be even more difficult to deal with. If we openly kill him, we risk inciting a furious retaliation from Golden Tang Gate. It would be best to devise a plan…"
Li Xuanxuan's implication was clear, and Li Yuanjiao had his own opinions. Though the family preferred to keep a low profile, they were never hesitant. The appearance of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator did not instill fear or impatience; rather, they contemplated the ways they could deal with him discreetly.
Troubled, Li Xuanxuan murmured, "But we can't confront him directly… Even if Master Monk and your siblings join forces, they can only stand a chance to take him down. Besides, we don't know how many trump cards he has up his sleeve. As a direct descendant of Golden Tang, he's bound to have many life-saving artifacts!"
Everyone fell silent, lost in their thoughts as they arrived at Libu Prefecture, where rolling hills and various villages peppered the landscape. Li Xizhi illuminated a jade talisman, infusing it with mana as he instructed his family, "Wait a moment."
After a brief pause, they spotted two figures riding the wind toward them. Both appeared to be at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, more mature and possessed an air of grace as if they had been raised in luxury.
They stopped before the group as one of them asked respectfully, "May I ask which of you is the envoy of the immortal sect?"
Li Xizhi tossed the jade token over to them and replied softly, "Qingdu Li Xizhi of Qingsui Peak… My master is Yuan Tuan, from the Yuan Family of Mushroom Forest!"
After hearing these words, the two men immediately grasped Li Xizhi's background. They bowed their heads respectfully and said, "Greetings, my lord! Please follow us… The helpers in the market are ready for your inspection…"
Li Xizhi waved his hand dismissively and replied, "No hurry, let them wait for now… These are my family members; they were attacked by bandits on the road and suffered some minor injuries. Please take care of them first. Arrange for the best spirit medicine and put the expenses on my account."
The two men quickly replied, "You must be joking, my lord… We can't possibly put the expenses on your account! We'll handle that right away!"
Li Xizhi smiled as he said, "I insist."
The two exchanged glances, their expressions shifting to one of obedience as they stammered, "Y-Yes… understood…"
Li Xizhi had no intention of leaving anything behind here that could be used against him in the future. He was not a direct descendant of the Chi Family and had not aligned himself with any faction within the clan, so he could not afford to exploit the situation without hesitation.
What a grand display!
Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan looked at each other before following one of the attendants downstairs. The old man turned to Li Xuanxuan, a look of uncertainty crossing his face.
"Have we met before, Senior?"
Li Xuanxuan smiled and replied, "I once ran a small store at Cloud Crowned Peak."
"Oh… oh! I was in charge of that place back then!" the old man exclaimed, recognition dawning on him.
As the old man recalled the past, he paused awkwardly. Li Xuanxuan utilized a secret technique to communicate quietly, "I remember those two… Back then, my family wasn't a clan yet, and I was selling talismans. They came to my store before… and were full of arrogance! But now…"
Li Xuanxuan could not help but snicker inwardly. The old man soon presented several spirit items. Li Yuanjiao selected a few inexpensive ones and said in a deep voice, "I'll take some time to rest in seclusion and prepare to depart in a few days."
Li Xijun nodded and followed him into seclusion. Meanwhile, Li Xuanxuan remained in the hall, dealing with the man's flattery, thinking to himself, "Azure Pond Sect's disciples… are truly cool!"
Li Family, Wutu Peak.
Li Ximing guided the flame in the furnace gently. It leaped into his palm and turned into Long Marching Fire Essence, and he opened his mouth, swallowing the flame into his belly.
"It's been a while since I reached the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm!"
He had stabilized his cultivation over the past few days and found the opportunity to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, entering the late stage and now becoming a powerful asset of the Li Family. He was another step closer to the Foundation Establishment Realm.
Meng Zhuoyun, who was standing nearby, was half undressed, revealing her snow-white skin. She lounged lazily on the ground, supporting herself with her elbows. In her left hand, she held a slender brush, while the other hand pressed down on a portrait.
She appeared quite relaxed, adding strokes to her artwork from time to time. Her feet were high up in the air, half of her body basking in the sun, her delicate skin glowing and her waist slender.
Li Ximing loosened the collar of his robe, rolling up his sleeves to reveal his own snow-white skin before pulling her into an embrace.
Meng Zhuoyun groaned as he turned her to face him, her brush momentarily forgotten.
"You've made another breakthrough… With your talent, it's no wonder the Li Family keeps a close eye on you," she remarked softly.
Li Ximing was usually quiet during intimate moments, but Meng Zhuoyun was always chattering. Her red lips and pearly whites glinted in the sunlight like blood-red jade as she spoke, captivating Li Ximing's attention.
"Don't seek revenge. He's dead already; just stay in here and live a peaceful life," he murmured.
"Hm?" Meng Zhuoyun exhaled softly, her cheeks flushing slightly.
Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she teased him, "What? Be your cauldron for life..?"
"What nonsense are you spouting?"
Li Ximing brushed a wet strand of hair from her forehead, revealing her smooth forehead. He rarely offered advice but now said with tenderness, "It's not a bad life for you… Your ex-husband was only with you for half a year due to a matchmaker's arrangement. Is he stronger than me?"
A trace of sadness crossed Meng Zhuoyun's face as she replied softly, "You are a genius; he can't possibly compare to you."
"That's right. Since you don't have any strong feelings for him, what's the point of clinging to revenge…?"
Li Ximing was about to offer more advice when his thoughts shifted abruptly.
This woman has a rare talent for alchemy. If she joins my family, her cultivation will accelerate year after year. On top of that, I won't have to waste my time refining those Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realm pills! It's a win-win situation!
"You're right, I didn't spend that much time with him... I only married him because it was arranged by the matchmaker," she replied, gasping for breath.
Her tone changed as she continued softly, "But he treated me like a person…"
Her soulful eyes locked onto his as she gently explained, "He was an intelligent man, but had no powerful background. He wasn't exceptional and the Foundation Establishment Realm was beyond his reach. Naturally, he couldn't compare to you… but he treated me like a human being, unlike you… You never show me any sincerity."
Li Ximing froze for a moment, staring into her eyes, which had suddenly regained their clarity amidst the haze of pleasure and intoxication.
"You treat me like a dog, like a tool… like an object. When I screamed in pain, you merely coaxed me. Once your needs are met, you cast me aside. I can only regain some dignity once you're happy…" she added with a hint of bitterness.
Li Ximing did not respond to her. But instead, he strangled her. Both of them groaned at the same time—one of pain and one of pleasure.
Li Ximing took a few moments to compose himself before casting a Purifying Spell to clean himself up.
"The pills needed today are Tranquility, Qi Nourishment, and Mind Calming. Don't forget to refine them," he instructed softly.
After saying that, he turned away without looking at her expression. Meng Zhuoyun, too weary to clean up herself, laid on her back for a moment before turning over to retrieve her half-wet painting. She picked up her brush and added a few more strokes.
The black ink melted away, leaving a finger-sized blotch on the paper. As Meng Zhuoyun sat up naked, beads of sweat glistened on her snow-white skin, rolling down the delicate curves of her legs.
She hung the painting up and scrutinized it closely. It depicted Li Ximing sitting comfortably in a large chair with her standing beside him, both smiling sweetly.
"Heh..."
She let out a lingering cold laugh that sounded almost like a groan. The pale blue orchid in her hair shimmered in the sunlight.
