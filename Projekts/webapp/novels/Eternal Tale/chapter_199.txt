"Let me tell you youngsters a story," Chen Xun said, raising his gaze to the night sky, a look of reminiscence in his eyes. "Do you know about the great war between the Qian Nation and the Wu Nation's cultivation world?"
The three looked puzzled. Wasn't the Wu Nation's cultivation world always part of the Qian Nation?
Jiang Xuechen also had a moment of confusion, recalling a few vague records she had read long ago, though the details were fuzzy. The war had happened before they were born, and their elders rarely spoke of it.
"Back then, the Wu Nation was not part of the Qian Nation. It was conquered by the Qian Nation's cultivation world."
"What?! Ancestor, did a great war really happen in the Qian Nation's cultivation world?" Liu Han's eyes widened in disbelief. The other two had equally shocked expressions, unable to imagine such a thing.
"At that time, we thought it was an invasion by the Wu Nation, and our blood was boiling as we prepared to go to battle," Chen Xun chuckled and patted the big black ox. "Some of our friends went as well; they were only at the Foundation Establishment stage, I think."
"Moo," the big black ox nodded slightly, its eyes holding an inexplicable meaning.
"Senior, did you experience that war? Did they return?" Jiang Xuechen asked, her eyes filled with hope, though her heart was shocked—just how old were these two seniors?
"Back then, the Qian Nation's cultivation world was at its peak, so of course, they returned," Chen Xun said softly, his gaze still fixed on the sky. "But after they returned, their foundations were damaged, and they could no longer progress in their cultivation."
The four listeners trembled at this revelation, fully understanding its implications. The atmosphere instantly grew heavy, and no one dared to speak.
Under the night sky, by the campfire, sparks flickered in the air.
Chen Xun continued his story at a slow pace. The big black ox shifted closer to him.
"Later, I thought about it—Foundation Establishment cultivators participating in a Nascent Soul-level battle, where even the aftermath could kill them. Weren't they just marching to their deaths?"
He suddenly burst into laughter. "So, the old ox and I started preparing funerals, receiving the bodies that were sent back from the battlefield."
"Of course, there were many nameless friends whose bodies were never recovered."
"Senior..." Jiang Xuechen hesitated, glancing at Chen Xun before lowering her head.
"It's fine. Just listen to the rest of the story," Chen Xun said, his tone calm. "Then you'll understand Jin Yu's situation better. The path of cultivation is inherently cruel."
"Yes," Jiang Xuechen nodded.
Chen Xun continued his tale, and the big black ox couldn't help but chime in, taking out a small booklet to add a few details.
The four listeners were more and more astonished, their eyes widening as they realized just how much these two had experienced. To them, it seemed like the pair had witnessed the entire rise and fall of the cultivation world—a living history.
Jiang Xuechen's chest heaved, and some of the knots in her heart quietly unraveled. Compared to these two seniors, her own concerns seemed trivial.
As the night deepened, bathed in the cold moonlight, shadows of trees stood desolate, and the campfire flickered dimly. The five figures' shadows gradually stretched longer.
"Heh, we avoided the great war of the cultivation world, and we also avoided the Northern War," Chen Xun said, his tone tinged with sadness. "But those who follow us must stand in front of their descendants. It's unavoidable."
"And what about you?"
"What kind of Nascent Soul cultivator doesn't have a home to protect, eh?" Chen Xun chuckled.
"Ancestor!"
"Ancestor…"
"Ancestor!" The three shouted in shock and anger. What was their ancestor saying? Their hearts were filled with urgency and frustration, but they didn't dare to speak out.
"What do you little ones understand?"
Chen Xun glanced behind him and sternly admonished, "Focus on your cultivation and don't end up like us."
For those who attain immortality, being rootless and wandering the world is inevitable. However, thinking of that great ship, Chen Xun felt a sense of comfort—it seemed that they might finally have a real home in the future.
The three disciples' faces turned a deep shade of red, embarrassed as they thought about their ancestor's longevity.
"Moo~" The big black ox let out a simple call, patting Chen Xun affectionately, understanding him better than anyone else.
"Xuechen, we might not stay here for much longer. When the time comes, I'll send these three youngsters down the mountain, and they will return to the Five Elements Sect."
"Senior, I understand," Jiang Xuechen replied, suddenly feeling an emptiness in her heart as she nodded solemnly. She knew that the seniors planned to cross the Tian Duan Plains and wouldn't stay here for long. But she also made a mental note of the Five Elements Sect, resolving that the Moon Tower must establish good relations with them in the future.
"Thank you, Senior, for resolving my doubts tonight. I will always remember the kindness you've shown to Moon Tower," Jiang Xuechen said as she stood up, bowing deeply to Chen Xun with genuine respect. "If you leave, please let me know."
"Of course."
"Moo~"
Chen Xun and the big black ox responded, both showing mutual respect.
Taking a deep breath, Jiang Xuechen lifted off into the air and gracefully departed.
The three people standing behind Chen Xun felt an emptiness in their hearts. They had grown genuinely fond of these two ancestors, who had treated them with sincere kindness, devoid of any ulterior motives.
"Liu Han, Shi Wujun, Ji Zhao."
"Ancestor!" The three stepped forward, raising their heads, and bowing.
Chen Xun looked at each of their faces in turn. "You two boys should take good care of Liu Han and listen to her advice."
"Yes, Ancestor," Shi Wujun and Ji Zhao replied in deep voices, the empty feeling in their hearts growing stronger.
"Ancestor, are you leaving?" Liu Han asked anxiously. "When will it be? I—"
"It’s alright; parting is inevitable," Chen Xun replied calmly, resting one hand behind his head. "I’ll watch over you until you reach the Golden Core stage. Then, I’ll send you down the mountain."
**Thud!**
**Thud!**
**Thud!**
Three kneeling sounds echoed as the three disciples knelt down. Though the two ancestors had never formally taken them as disciples, they had long since considered themselves their students in their hearts.
Chen Xun felt a bit dazed, his eyes perhaps not seeing clearly in the flickering firelight.
For a moment, he thought he saw Liu Yuan, Shi Jing, and Ji Kun.
"Stand up. I need to enter seclusion," Chen Xun said as he turned his gaze away, focusing on the big black ox. "Old Ox, you've put on quite a bit of weight, haven’t you?"
"Moo?!" The big black ox snorted in surprise, unsure if that was true.
"Yes, Ancestor."
The three slowly rose, their eyes dimmed with sorrow. As they were about to leave, Chen Xun suddenly called out:
"Come here once a month, and I’ll cook for you."
"Yes, Ancestor!!" They replied joyfully, remembering how, when they first arrived, the Ancestor cooked for them every day, saying that fasting pills were useless.
"Hurry up and go! You're making a fuss like country bumpkins," Chen Xun waved them off with a chuckle. "When you return to the Five Elements Sect, don’t tell anyone that I taught you."
The three laughed as they pulled out their magical artifacts from their storage pouches and flew towards Snow Listening Valley. They glanced back unintentionally.
In what seemed like an instant, the cliffside was empty and desolate, with only a few scattered campfires gradually burning out.
The two ancestors still sat in those rocking chairs; their expressions serene as they gazed silently at the vast starry sky.
Between their temples, it seemed as though a sense of quiet joy from the passage of time would forever linger…
