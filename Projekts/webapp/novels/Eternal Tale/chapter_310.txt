Once Meng Sheng had completely disappeared from sight, Chen Xun and the big black ox suddenly stopped in front of a thousand-year-old Crane Spirit Tree, their expressions turning indignant!
"Brother Xun? Brother Ox?"
"Damn it, Little Red, you didn't actually think we got here through the teleportation array, did you?"
"Uh… yeah?"
Little Red looked puzzled. If they didn't use the teleportation array, then how did they get here? Brother Xun had even admitted it before…
"Old Ox, chop it down!"
"Moo!"
Chen Xun suddenly pulled out a Mountain-Opening Axe, while the big black ox lowered its horns. Their movements were swift and precise—boom! The thousand-year-old Crane Spirit Tree was cleanly severed and crashed to the ground!
"Teleportation array, my ass! We ran here!"
"Moo! Moo! Moo!"
"Ah?! Brother Xun, you ran here?!" Little Red was completely stunned, exclaiming in disbelief, "You ran here?!"
"Moo!" The big black ox nodded honestly. Back in Qian Nation, they hadn't encountered any significant cultivation opportunities. Instead, they had just trudged their way here.
They continued moving forward, their voices carrying through the mountains, cursing at their misfortune. Once again, they had played the part of ultimate suckers—other people had great luck, even using large teleportation arrays, while they had to make do with sheer effort.
Little Red nervously glanced back at the fallen Crane Spirit Tree. He couldn't shake the feeling that Brother Xun and Brother Ox had some personal vendetta against it.
Over the next month, Chen Xun and his companions roamed all over the Ten Thousand Mountains, befriending many spiritual beasts along the way.
He had already obtained the fourth and fifth levels of the Water Spirit Art, even making a copy of them. However, he noticed a strange flaw in Yu Jingxin’s cultivation method—it seemed to contain some sort of divine sense imprint as if it were designed to be tracked.
With his late-stage Nascent Soul divine sense, he could now perceive many hidden details.
The cultivators of the Great Li Realm had better not try to trick him. Against absolute divine sense suppression, all deception was meaningless!
Instead of resorting to robbery and murder, he trusted more in his own spiritual herbs and spirit stones—honest transactions were the true path.
As for the Chaoyuan Red Treasure Tree, even the Jiuhua Patriarch had granted them access, allowing them to exchange for a few branches. He planned to cultivate them later, as the essence of all things was never truly bound by its environment.
"Roar! Roar!"
Little Red was playing happily in the distance with a Golden Core-stage Jiuhua Sealed Demon Ape. His mischievous gaze darted around, but he never strayed more than a mile from Chen Xun.
The big black ox had ventured deep into the Ten Thousand Mountains to discuss the Path with the Jiuhua Patriarch, only returning at mealtimes. It was essentially free-range at this point.
The first time Little Red followed along, he was so traumatized that he swore he'd never go again. Discussing the Path? That was not what was happening; what he had witnessed was all-out combat!
For the past month, the depths of the Ten Thousand Mountains had been rocked by earth-shaking booms, leaving all the spiritual beasts on edge. At the mere sight of a large black ox, they would immediately flee.
Meanwhile, Chen Xun sat cross-legged on the ground, making his final calculations. Compared to before, his progress had sped up dramatically.
A misty fog surrounded him, where Five Elements Divine Light flickered, and within the fog, five shadowy figures flickered in and out of existence, all engaged in deducing profound truths.
"Nascent Soul techniques… Five-element spiritual roots are far more complex than single-element roots, but my methods have also multiplied accordingly."
Chen Xun smiled slightly and pointed at one of the golden-element figures. The figure’s expression twisted in pain as its body underwent transformation, forcefully reverse-engineering the Five-Element Nascent Soul technique.
The other four figures nodded slightly and began cultivating forcibly, the sounds of breaking meridians continuously echoing from their bodies.
Chen Xun pressed his two fingers together at his chest and slowly closed his eyes. The elemental energy of heaven and earth surged toward him, radiating an oppressive force in all directions.
Little Red and the Golden Core spiritual beast, terrified, immediately prostrated themselves on the ground in silence.
The five primordial spirits showed increasing signs of agony, dark lights flashing above their heads. Using his divine sense, Chen Xun meticulously observed every change occurring within them.
Meanwhile, his Five-Element power was rapidly repairing their bodies, boosting his efficiency by manyfold. His comprehension of cultivation techniques had skyrocketed.
The Path is vast with countless paths, and there are billions of cultivation techniques. Only through the transformation of the soul can one break through the threshold, glimpse its essence, and understand the self through the Great Demon Heart Tribulation. One must also comprehend the heavens and earth through their primal energy!
Chen Xun’s mind was filled with an unprecedented, strange sensation, as if he had truly grasped the essence of the technique, no longer merely following a formula like before.
His entire body emitted thick, turbid energy as he felt the breath of mountains, the rushing of rivers, and the tranquility and naturalness of every grass and tree.
This sensation had first appeared when he was training with the axe, but now, while deducing the technique, it seemed to complement his earlier experiences in an extraordinary way.
Chen Xun was immersed in this feeling, almost intoxicated. A soul-transforming expert could call upon the primordial energies of heaven and earth, and the techniques were created based on the sensations derived from these energies.
Using this as a medium, he no longer forcibly opened meridians to expand acupoints but began to comprehend the Five Elements' energies within the soul transformation realm, paving the way for his true path.
Half a day later, a small white booklet appeared before him, and gradually, a line of text began to materialize: Five Elements Soul Transformation Technique.
The six words appeared with a flash, and at that moment, the heavens and earth seemed to resonate in unison, and the mountains trembled with immense force!
"Boom!"
A violent shockwave rippled through the Ten Thousand Mountains, and the overwhelming pressure of the Five Elements condensed into tangible form. The spiritual veins of the earth trembled, and the spiritual energy screeched.
Five Elements Divine Light erupted from where Chen Xun was seated, shooting up into the sky, and emanating a terrifying aura that spread out with boundless waves of spiritual power.
In that instant, the essence of heaven and earth surged like a tidal wave, enveloping everything with a blinding white glow, overturning everything around, and the silvery-white light flooded Chen Xun’s body.
The celestial phenomena were so immense they shook the very heavens and earth. A vast and terrifying pressure filled the air, and spiritual beasts from all directions were struck with horror, feeling their bloodlines suppressed.
Not only the spiritual beasts, but even the soldiers stationed in the Ten Thousand Mountains felt as though they could barely breathe, as if an innate pressure had fallen upon them.
Sounds of commotion spread, but they quickly quieted. The military discipline of the Baili Clan was strict, so this was not an invasion by foreign enemies.
In the distant ancient buildings, the women of the Baili Clan whispered, but their expressions were filled with boldness, carrying an unusual beauty.
Meng Sheng looked up at the sky, filled with awe and longing. He was certain that he would one day find the path to immortality and gaze upon the vastness of the heavens and earth!
At that moment, a grand mountain peak suddenly appeared with an ancient palace emerging from it. A man dressed in black battle attire walked out. His dark hair fluttered in the wind, and his gaze was deep as he looked down at the distant land.
Baili Wentian stood a distance away and respectfully cupped his hands, saying, "Ancestor."
"Prepare; I will personally seek out those from the Great Li Realm."
The man spoke coldly, and an overwhelming killing intent gradually spread. "This Chen Xun, fellow Daoist, is very strong—far stronger than I imagined."
Baili Wentian nodded lightly, his gaze turning to a distant spot. The aura of suppression from the heavens and earth just now felt similar to the pressure he experienced during his Nascent Soul stage facing a Soul Transformation expert!
In the depths of the Ten Thousand Mountains.
The Jiuhua Ancestor was startled, and the big black ox was equally shocked. After exchanging a single blow, both of them were forced to retreat several hundred meters, their expressions slightly grim.
“Moo moo moo~~!!”
"Black Ox, fellow Daoist, please, it seems that Chen Xun, fellow Daoist, has reached a critical breakthrough."
The Jiuhua Ancestor spoke like thunder, but its fur was trembling. "It seems that the technique Chen Xun is cultivating is no simple matter."
Its gaze turned to the sky, drawing on the essence of heaven and earth. The Jiuhua Sealed Demon Ape clan could only accomplish this when they were born…
The big black ox was alarmed, transforming into a streak of light, and hurriedly leaving. Why hadn’t Big Brother let it act as his protector?
Such a commotion could attract external enemies, and that would spell trouble!
