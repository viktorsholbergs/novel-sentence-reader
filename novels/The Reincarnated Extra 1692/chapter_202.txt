The God Gives an Oracle ②
* * *
<<<It should be “Kakushii-sama”! I’m a god! The Cube God! The most prestigious cube in the world! Show more reverence!>>>
“Hehehe, sorry.”
The Cube God Kakushii, who governs cubes in this otherworld of Ardyst, got angry with its corners sharpened.
However, Kakushii’s apostle Viola just grinned without any sign of remorse.
The relationship between this one god and one person has remained the same ever since they met.
<<<…… Well, fine. Any more would be a waste of time…… Viola, the reason I summoned you here is none other than…… to give you an oracle.>>>
The Cube God gave up on correcting its apostle’s insolent attitude with a sigh and got to the main point.
Upon hearing those words…… Viola’s eyes shone eerily.
“Alright, an oracle…… I’ll do anything. What should I do?”
Viola leaned forward and asked the Cube God.
However, the Cube God didn’t answer immediately, floating around in the full-length mirror, and said something like this.
<<<Hey, Viola…… Have you ever heard the term “serves you right”?>>>
“Huh? Serves you right?…… I, being of shallow learning and little talent, am not familiar with it…… Ah, I see, it’s like “You get what’s coming to you?” or something?”
<<<That’s basically it. I’d like you to carry out a “serves you right” that adds color to my story.>>>
“I don’t see where this is going. Explain it more clearly. What should I do?”
<<<You will kill that great sinner Giovanno for me.>>>
Upon receiving that oracle.
Viola.
…… Tilted her head in puzzlement.
<<<H-Hey, you know Giovanno, right? That unprecedented great villain Giovanno Ack Toh!? Didn’t you capture him together with Mereucce!? That old man with the villain face!>>>
“Aah…… Was there someone like that? Sorry, I’m not good at remembering people. I quickly forget faces other than those I’ve killed.”
<<<You see…… Since that incident, you took on a personal disciple, right? That boy named Narakan. It was that Giovanno who created the opportunity for that child to be sold as an illegal slave.>>>
“I see, I see.”
Narakan was the first illegal slave that Mereucce helped and the one who gave her the opportunity to notice Giovanno’s misdeeds.
Since he had no relatives and had the aptitude to be in the underworld, he currently works ostensibly as an apprentice gardener for the Runtart family, but in reality, he is an apprentice in the underworld receiving guidance from Viola.
He is an innocent boy who has strong loyalty to Mereucce, who saved him.
How pleasurable would it be to suddenly stab a knife into the chest of this boy who looks up to Viola as his master and trusts her?
Viola spends her days concealing such dark delusions and her vulgar true nature behind the mask of a “calm and capable underworld maid,” a character in Mereucce’s story.
Even now…… She ended up having such delusions.
While feeling exasperated at Viola, who blushed and laughed while shaking her shoulders, the Cube God continued talking.
<<<That man, in my plot, was supposed to be exiled to the demon realm called the Zamago Forest and die miserably by being eaten by monsters there. I designed that man’s life, including such an ending.>>>
“Aha, what a cruel story.”
<<<You think so? Shouldn’t it be an honor to be cared for by a god?…… Anyway, despite that, you know what? For some unknown reason, that man is still stubbornly surviving in that forest, seemingly making comrades!>>>
“Oh? How can that be? For the fate that you, a god, foresaw to be overturned…… Is that even possible?”
<<<Of course it’s possible. There are no absolutes in this world.>>>
“Hmm.”
Viola yawned in disinterest, even though she was the one who asked.
“So? What’s wrong with that?”
<<<It lacks the “serves you right” element as a story!>>>
Perhaps out of excitement, the Cube God vibrated up and down, left and right, while changing its color over and over.
<<<Listen up! That Giovanno committed the unforgivable evil deed of illegal slave trade! There are many people who became unhappy because of that! And yet, that guy is living carefree! The viewers won’t allow that, right!?>>>
“Uh-huh, I see. So you can’t forgive that the bad guy is surviving.”
<<<Huh, me? I don’t really care if people live or die! After all, I’m a cube! In the first place, if I couldn’t forgive bad guys, I wouldn’t choose a piece of trash like you as my apostle no matter how efficient and convenient you are for work!>>>
“Aha, that’s harsh! I got called trash! Oh my, oh my!”
<<<I’m a cube, so I don’t really understand, but aren’t people who kill their own kind for their own pleasure without any sin trash? Even yesterday, it was tough for me to hide it, even though I’m a god, you know? At least stop reducing your colleagues.>>>
“…………Ahaa.”
Being scolded by the Cube God, Viola, far from reflecting, started to reminisce about yesterday’s kill and indulge in delusions.
…… Killing is good.
No matter how amazing or smart someone is, once killed, they become an existence inferior to Viola.
Only then can Viola love that existence……
<<<Hey! Stop! Stoooop! I’m still in the middle of talking! Don’t go on a trip on your own!>>>
“…… Yeah, I got it, I got it. Calm down, my ears hurt.”
Pulled back to reality by the Cube God screaming in a high-pitched voice, Viola stood up with a wry smile and stretched.
“Anyway, that’s it. The oracle I should carry out this time is ‘Kill Giovanno,’ right? Any specifications on how to do it?”
<<<You can do it however you want! Anyway, what’s important is the result of Giovanno dying!>>>
“Can I kill the people around him too? He has comrades, right? That Giovanno guy or whatever.”
<<<…… You really like that, huh…… It’s fine, do as you please!>>>
“……Aha!”
Upon hearing those words from the Cube God, Viola showed a beaming smile, turned her back to the full-length mirror, and pushed open the heavily rusted iron door.
<<<Listen up! Even though I said you can do as you please, the most important thing is the “serves you right” for Giovanno! Don’t forget that!>>>
In response to the Cube God shouting from behind as if to make sure, Viola raised her right hand as a reply without looking back and closed the door, starting to climb the stairs.

(Now then, where should I start……)
Viola, who had been given an exciting oracle from her true master, walked through the hallway of the Runtart Count’s mansion while suppressing her high spirits that made her want to skip.
With her evil inner thoughts concealed by her neat and tidy demeanor, she could undoubtedly be called a perfect maid no matter how you looked at her.
(That target has comrades, was it…… I wonder if I alone will have enough hands? I hope it’s enough…… I want to kill them all myself……)
The more people she kills, the happier she is.
Viola is that kind of murderer for pleasure.
However, even so.
(I definitely don’t want to fail.)
Despite her insolent attitude, this person named Viola firmly believes in that incomprehensible existence called the Cube God.
It’s because that god is there and because that god’s power conceals everything that she can have her current life.
She can balance a peaceful life with her hobby activities.
Before meeting the Cube God, Viola used to work as both a high-ranking adventurer as her public job and an assassin as her secret job.
Killing monsters in public and killing people in secret.
It was an exciting and fun daily life in its own way, but even she wouldn’t stay young forever.
She felt a bit tired too.
Viola feels indebted to the Cube God Kakushii, who provided her with her current life, and thinks she must repay that debt.
(If I remember correctly, the target is in a demon realm now. Then…… Aha, that’s interesting too. Wait…… In addition to that…………)
An evil plan gradually forms in Viola’s mind.
“…………Aha.”
A smile inadvertently spills out.
Even though she wears large glasses, wears makeup, and dresses plainly, her efforts don’t completely erase her beauty.
The enchanting smile shown by a calm, serious, and rarely smiling earnest maid……
A male servant who happened to see it unintentionally looked back at Viola after passing by and blushed.
(Anyway, first……)
Now, for the time being, Viola decided on the general outline of her plan to carry out the “serves you right” given by the god.
Beyond this, she has no choice but to prepare to some extent, actually visit the site, and handle things flexibly.
And since that’s the case, what she should do here and now.
That is……
(I’ll apply for paid leave.)
The Runtart Count’s family has a paid vacation system.
It’s part of the system reform being pushed by the prodigy child Mereucce Runtart.
If asked whether there is a story-related necessity for the god this time to be the Cube God, I can confidently say.
There isn’t!
It’s just, don’t you think the oracle that this time’s god gave to Viola is a bit too much?
Viola’s true nature is quite evil too.
For example, if it were the Fate God, it would symbolize fate, and if it were the Justice God, it would symbolize justice, but if this time’s Kakushii-sama were to symbolize something by mistake, it might disparage that something, so I didn’t like it.
That’s why I made Kakushii-sama the Cube God.
Cubes won’t attract hate, right?
In other words, it’s the author’s deep consideration and adult discretion! Hehe! (Shut up)
