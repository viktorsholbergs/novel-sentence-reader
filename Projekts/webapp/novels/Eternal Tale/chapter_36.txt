Chen Xun and the black ox crouched inside the flying ship and constantly exclaimed in awe. They were both very overwhelmed and their knees turned into jelly.
"Old ox, this is the world of cultivation... What's Nine Stars Valley compared to this?" Chen Xun's voice trembled, and he stared at the ground with his mouth wide open, completely astounded by the difference, whether it be in size or class.
"Moo..." The black ox's eyes were trembling, and even its mooing was stretched out. There were so many cultivators on the ground.
**_Buzz..._**
**_Buzz..._**
Several giant ships gently landed onto the ground, raising clouds of dust.
This place was like an enormous open platform, and there were over a hundred disciples standing in front, holding clothing and magical artifacts.
The elders on the ships retrieved their respective magical artifacts and took flight. They talked and laughed as they left.
Only about forty or so cultivators disembarked from the ships. They looked at the immortal sect disciples with uncertainty, unsure of what to do.
Chen Xun stood at the edge with the black ox. They looked around in all directions, but were puzzled by the lack of a welcoming ceremony.
"Everyone," Yin Jun stood at the forefront. He had an entirely different demeanor from when he talked with them on the ship. He said enthusiastically, "Take the sect's items. From now on, we are all brothers and sisters!"
As soon as he finished speaking, the disciples behind him all took a step forward. The vagabond cultivators quickly went to receive their clothing and tokens before bowing in gratitude.
"Dust Removing Technique,' 'Sword Control Technique,' 'Five Elements Secret,' 'Regulations of the Sect,' and even storage bags..."
Chen Xun was already laughing uncontrollably from happiness and couldn't even close his mouth properly. He looked at the disciples standing in front of him.
One of the disciples furrowed his brows slightly, seemingly displeased with his raised voice.
He said coldly, "After receiving your items, go to the sect's main hall and choose your respective positions. Your contributions will determine your future in the sect."
"Thank you, thank you." Chen Xun nodded with a smile before he couldn’t hold it anymore and started laughing again softly.
The disciple turned around and walked away without saying any more words. He clearly didn't want to talk to Chen Xun and the others.
"So aloof?" Chen Xun raised an eyebrow.
After a second, he realized that he didn't know the way to the sect's main hall.
It seemed that these sect disciples were quite arrogant and didn't want to talk to him.
"Still, we shouldn't just discard our old clothes,"
Chen Xun carefully folded his coarse robe and placed it in the pockets on both sides of the big black ox. This robe was sewn stitch by stitch by him, and the quality was excellent.
"Moo."
The big black ox nodded, its eyes filled with joy. The spiritual energy here in the sect was far better than in the Ningyun Mountain Range.
"Junior Brother Chen." Ji Kun had also changed into the sect's attire and hung the token on his waist. "Shall we go to the sect's main hall?" he asked.
Seeing that Chen Xun seemed somewhat at a loss, he caught the fact that he didn’t know his way around. These sect disciples appeared quite arrogant and refused to talk to newcomers after all.
"Sure, thank you for guiding the way, Senior Brother Ji," Chen Xun said as he followed behind Ji Kun, leading the black ox.
The Five Elements Sect's main hall was built halfway up the mountain. This place was bustling with activity, and all the disciples of the Five Elements Sect were going to and fro.
The main hall was simple yet elegant and incredibly grand. Chen Xun and the black ox stood in front of it like ants, completely insignificant in comparison.
They looked up to the building in awe.
Outside the hall, several black pillars were engraved with unknown spirit beasts. Their scales, claws, and beards danced and seemed to be on the verge of coming to life and taking flight on massive wings.
"Chen Junior Brother, I'll go in first." Ji Kun looked at Chen Xun, who was still in awe, and said, "But consider what I said.”
"Sure, I will definitely consider it, Senior Brother Ji. You can go ahead," Chen Xun quickly regained his composure and replied with a respectful nod.
Ji Kun didn't say more and turned to walk towards the sect's main hall with hopeful anticipation, finally fulfilling his dream after many years.
"Old ox, take a look at these buildings; this is the true foundation of a major sect," Chen Xun praised as he walked toward it slowly. He patted one of the pillars. "What craftsmanship!"
"Moo?" The big black ox became interested and used its head to nudge the structure. It was cold to the touch.
Compared to these sect disciples, Chen Xun and the black ox were not very interested in worldly gains. They were actually standing there, admiring the sect's main hall.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were both filled with joy as they increased their knowledge, constantly touching and feeling everything around them.
While batches of disciples entered the main hall one after another, Chen Xun and the big black ox were still circling around the main hall, fascinated by it.
A righteous-looking man approached them and asked, "What are you doing here with an ox?"
Chen Xun was taken aback and looked at the man, who turned out to be a ninth-level Qi cultivator.
He hastily greeted, "Greetings, Senior Brother. We're admiring the sect's main hall."
"Admiring the sect's main hall?" The man was taken aback, and he looked at the towering pillars. "Junior Brother, I'm from the Hall of Enforcement. Time is precious around here, better not to waste it on such things."
"Thank you for your advice, Senior Brother," Chen Xun said with a polite smile, feeling relieved. This guy was unexpectedly kind.
"Well, you're a new disciple of the Five Elements Sect, right?" The man smiled faintly. He had hung his sect token upside down and was holding a storage bag in his hand.
The big black ox also had several items hanging on its sides, clearly indicating that they were newcomers from outside.
"Senior Brother has a keen eye," Chen Xun said, feeling somewhat uncomfortable under his prying eyes.
"Come, I'll accompany Junior Brother into the hall and introduce the halls of the sect to you," the man said in a friendly manner, taking Chen Xun by the hand and holding the big black ox's lead.
"Alright, Senior Brother, please do!" Chen Xun said as he was led inside.
"Moo~"
Two surprised exclamations came from outside the hall as they were forcibly pulled into the main hall by their enthusiastic senior brother.
This enthusiastic senior brother, whose name was Le Feng, was a talented disciple of the Hall of Enforcement within the Five Elements Sect. He was deeply respected and beloved by his fellow disciples for his years of persuading lost junior brothers and sisters to return to the right path. It was said that he had even made some disciples cry bitterly, admitting their mistakes and begging for forgiveness.
As for the outer disciples, the main hall of the sect offered a wide range of choices: Hall of Alchemy, Hall of Refining, Hall of Talismans, Hall of Spiritual Beasts, and the Hall of Enforcement, among some others.
However, there was this one position in the Hall of Enforcement which was not popular: managing the sect's medicinal garden. It was seen as the most laborious and least rewarding job because cultivating spiritual herbs was extremely challenging. Daily tasks included watering with spiritual water and weeding, and every year, you had to turn in your share of the herbs cultivated in your designated plot.
Initially, all the disciples thought it was an easy task and rushed to sign up for it. However, they quickly realized that not only did they have no time for cultivation, but they also couldn't meet their herb quotas. They ended up not earning enough contributions and received harsh scoldings.
Cultivating spiritual herbs was a skill that required time and patience. Even with increased contributions as an incentive, only a few people were willing to take up the job, and the sect had to assign some of the more experienced disciples to help.
"Senior Brother Le, I want to manage the medicinal garden!" Chen Xun said excitedly.
This position was perfectly suited to his skills.
