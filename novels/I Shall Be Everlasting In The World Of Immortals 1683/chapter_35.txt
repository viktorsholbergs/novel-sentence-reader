Chapter 35 Bamboo Leaf Market Town
When Mu Xiuyun spoke to this point, Lan Chang'an couldn't refuse.
What really swayed him was the double salary.
Over the years, as his talisman arts improved, the Mu family not only gave him the treatment of a regular clan cultivator, but also an additional spirit stone salary.
If combined with the shop salary, Lan Chang'an would have a considerable steady income.
His cultivation, body refinement, and raising the Earth Burrowing Rat were not insignificant expenses.
In any case, Lan Chang'an had plenty of spare time. Bamboo Leaf Mountain had a second-grade spiritual vein. Even without enjoying the core area's spirit vein, the cultivation effect was definitely not inferior to Feiyue Manor.
Moreover, with the market's heavy human traffic, it would be far better at sensing information about the cultivation world than the relatively secluded Feiyue Manor.
"Young Miss, do you think Mu Ershun is suitable to be an apprentice?" Lan Chang'an didn't forget Li Ergou's request.
"Mu Ershun?" Mu Xiuyun pondered. "That child understands a bit of talisman theory and barely meets the requirements. Since you've brought it up, I'll give him a spot." After chatting for a while, Mu Xiuyun stood up.
"Lan Chang'an, what's your current success rate for superior-grade talismans?" As she walked to the courtyard, she asked.
"A one in four success rate, which is still a loss," Lan Chang'an answered.
First-rank superior-grade talismans required much higher costs for talisman paper, spirit ink, and much greater loss of talisman brushes.
Painting each superior-grade talisman caused a considerable drain on the spirit and mind of those at the Qi-Refining stage, and time itself was a cost.
"This progress is already not small." Mu Xiuyun nodded and left the separate courtyard, leaving behind a fragrance like cassia and orchids.
...
Half a month later.
A small flying boat set off from Feiyue Manor, sailing amidst the clouds.
Mu Xiuyun stood gracefully at the bow, her beautiful hair hanging to her waist and dress fluttering, with a side profile as beautiful as a painting.
Lan Chang'an stood beside her.
Behind were a boy and a girl, both apprentices looking a little shy.
The boy with thick eyebrows and big eyes was Mu Ershun.
The other Mu family girl was named Mu Shan, a beautiful seventeen or eighteen-year-old at the second layer of Qi-Refining who was a talisman apprentice.
Over the years, the Mu family's economic situation had greatly improved, and they had also purchased two more small flying boats.
This was mainly because of the stable situation, where in addition to the Feiyue Lake aquatic products, the Mu family also had income from a complete purple copper mine.
Mu Renlong, this new Foundation Establishment cultivator, was in the prime of life without worries about his lifespan. The addition of immortal seedlings like Li Ergou brought new blood to the Mu family.
The reinvigorated Mu family exuded an aura of prosperity.
Along the way, they inevitably mentioned the newly established Bamboo Leaf Market Town.
"Bamboo Leaf Mountain's geographical location is very suitable for opening a market. There are no well-established cultivator trading places nearby, be it Five Peaks Market Town or Yellow Dragon Immortal City, they are all quite far from the surrounding cultivator families..." Mu Xiuyun introduced the situation of the new market.
"The establishment of the Bamboo Leaf Market Town makes things more convenient for several Foundation Establishment families, dozens of small Qi-Refining families, and numerous scattered cultivators, filling a gap."
Lan Chang'an had seen the maps. The Huang family's move was exquisite.
As for the Beast Taming Zhou Family, their territory was more widespread and further away from this area.
Moreover, the Zhou family's base was near the branch ranges of the Black Fog Mountain Range. Although there was also a market in that area, it mainly dealt in materials from demonic beasts and spiritual beasts due to the geographical factors, making it difficult to radiate outwards.
"In order to attract people, the Huang family sold market shops at low prices to nearby Foundation Establishment families."
"What about the Zhou family?" Lan Chang'an asked curiously.
The Zhou family had a Fake-Dan Immortal, already surpassing the level of a Foundation Establishment family.
"The Huang family gifted the Zhou family five shops and ten cave dwellings on Bamboo Leaf Mountain," Mu Xiuyun said, her voice slightly chilly.
"So many?" Mu Ershun and Mu Shan exclaimed in surprise behind them.
Once the Bamboo Leaf Market Town flourished, even a single shop would be a money tree.
"The shameless Maple Leaf Huang family, sucking up to the Zhou family like this," the thirteen-year-old Mu Ershun could see it and muttered with disdain.
In the past two years, Lan Chang'an had heard rumors that the Maple Leaf Huang family wanted to send a clan daughter to the Zhou family as a concubine.
"Establishing the market, giving benefits to the Zhou family, mending relations, currying favor with one or two branches, and then seeking a marriage alliance..." Lan Chang'an inwardly praised the Huang family's meticulous planning.
In previous years, the Beast Taming Zhou Family had been somewhat dissatisfied with the Huang family's absorption of the Zheng family. However, over the past two years, the Zhou family's exclusion and hostility towards the Huang family had decreased significantly.
...
Two days later.
The flying boat landed in the Bamboo Leaf Market Town.
"Such a rich wood spirit qi." Lan Chang'an observed the terrain and found that a large number of spirit bamboo were planted on Bamboo Leaf Mountain, mostly semi-spirit plants and a few first-grade spirit bamboo.
Spirit bamboo had once been the Zheng family's main industry, just like the Mu family's Feiyue Lake aquatic products.
The market was built on the midslope of Bamboo Leaf Mountain, its scale slightly smaller than the Five Peaks Market Town that Lan Chang'an had visited before.
After all, the Five Peaks Market Town was backed by the WanJian Zhuo Family, one of the seven great cultivation families of the Liang Kingdom.
At the foot of the mountain were vast spirit fields, mainly growing spirit grains, and low-grade medicinal herbs.
Apart from a few cave dwellings, there was a luxurious mansion at the mountain peak, surrounded by spirit bamboo, with no shortage of first-grade spiritual bamboo.
The spirit qi emanating from there reached the level of a second-grade spiritual vein.
Lan Chang'an didn't need to guess, important members of the Huang family must be living in that mansion on the mountaintop.
The newly opened market streets were deserted with few people around.
"This is our talisman shop," Mu Xiuyun came to a three-story building with a plaque engraved "Mu Family Spirit Talisman Shop."
The shop occupied half an acre and had a rear courtyard with a few simple wooden huts.
The first floor was for displaying products, with a reception room in the back.
They mainly sold first-rank and basic talismans, as well as related items such as talisman paper, spirit vermilion sand, talisman brushes, and talisman painting books.
Half of the second floor was a storage room with multiple restrictions, while the other half was partitioned off into a suite as a place for the chief talisman master to reside.
This would be Lan Chang'an's residence in the future.
The third floor was for the shopkeeper, with a spacious talisman room set aside.
As for the two apprentices Mu Ershun and Mu Shan, they lived in the simple wooden huts in the rear courtyard.
The four tidied up the place.
The next day, the Mu Family Spirit Talisman Shop officially opened for business.
Some forces and shopkeepers on good terms with the Mu family came to offer congratulations and sent flower baskets.
This was Lan Chang'an's first time here, so he mingled and got acquainted, helping Mu Xiuyun receive guests.
As they greeted people coming and going, Mu Xiuyun discreetly transmitted her voice, introducing Lan Chang'an to the identities and backgrounds of the various guests.
Amidst the bustle, listening to the young lady's gentle and melodious voice, Lan Chang'an's mood improved considerably.
"Miss Mu, why didn't you let me know the shop was opening? This Huang could have helped rally some friends to support the occasion."
Towards evening, a young man dressed in a purple robe with a stately bearing calmly strode into the shop.
Behind the young man were two Qi-Refining mid-stage bodyguards standing guard at the entrance.
"Young Master Huang, this girl has failed to extend a proper invitation," Mu Xiuyun took light steps forward, an unnatural smile appearing on her face.
She discreetly gave Lan Chang'an a signal with her eyes.
Lan Chang'an immediately understood the visitor's identity - Huang Yu, the young master of the Maple Leaf Huang family.
Years ago, when the two families were in conflict, the Mu family had originally intended to marry Mu Xiuyun to Huang Yu of the Huang family.
However, the Huang family's attitude was arrogant, only willing to give her the status of a concubine at most, so the marriage fell through.
"Young Master Huang," Lan Chang'an cupped his fist in salutation.
Huang Yu's phoenix eyes glanced at Lan Chang'an and gave a slight nod, not asking about his identity.
After that, Huang Yu focused solely on the elegant and beautiful Mu Xiuyun, conversing and laughing amiably with a cultured demeanor.
If an ordinary person stared constantly at a beauty, it would seem uncouth.
But with Huang Yu's refined manner, his faint smile made it seem like admiration.
Of course, this was also due to the privilege of his status.
The young master Huang Yu possessed a high-grade spirit root and had reached the ninth layer of Qi-Refining, making him the administrator of this market town.
His status and position naturally placed him above others.
They chatted for a while until the sky darkened.
Huang Yu glanced at Lan Chang'an beside him before finally leaving.
As he departed, he handed Mu Xiuyun a letter.
Only after Huang Yu left did the smile disappear from Mu Xiuyun's face.
She quickly scanned the letter, a flash of cold light flickering in her starry eyes.
She then handed the letter to Lan Chang'an.
Lan Chang'an was stunned for a moment, not expecting the young lady to be so open with her private affairs.
After reading the letter, Lan Chang'an was astonished.
In the letter, Huang Yu said that since the last time he saw Mu Xiuyun, he couldn't think of anything else. He was willing to demote his current wife to a concubine and marry Mu Xiuyun into his household.
If Mu Xiuyun agreed, he would offer three shops and five cave dwellings in the market town as a betrothal gift.
"It may not be that simple," Lan Chang'an pondered with a wry smile.
Fortunately, that young master Huang showed no intention of pestering her further, not visiting for a long time after.
That letter seemed like merely a joke.
...
Business was slow for all the shops in the newly established market.
As the chief talisman master, Lan Chang'an also enjoyed the tranquility, taking time off to guide his apprentices.
Due to the abundance of spirit bamboo, Bamboo Leaf Mountain held an advantage for wood-based cultivation techniques.
The shop's location had a spirit qi environment equivalent to a first-grade spiritual vein, so Lan Chang'an's cultivation efficiency here was even higher than at the Feiyue Manor.
This allowed him more free time each day, which he sometimes spent drinking tea and alcohol in the market town.
During this period, a pavilion for entertainment also opened in the market. However, Lan Chang'an never visited it.
Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.
The business of the Mu Family Spirit Talisman Shop gradually picked up.
