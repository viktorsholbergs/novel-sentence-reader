Lan Chang'an considered whether he should hold back first and not advance to the fourth layer of Qi-Refining.
Because within the family, the young and middle-aged cultivators at the middle stage of Qi-Refining would mostly be summoned to the front line mining area.
But after thinking it over, he decided not to hold back.
Firstly, advancing to the middle stage of Qi-Refining mana would increase significantly. For Lan Chang'an, who was re-cultivating, his strength would rise by a large margin.
Secondly, this was also a test.
If even a talented talisman master like himself would be summoned to the front lines, it meant the situation had reached a desperate stage. If that were the case, Lan Chang'an had no reason to remain in the Mu family.
If he truly wanted to leave, coupled with the methods from his previous life and top quality talismans, it would be difficult for a late stage Qi-Refining cultivator to catch up unless the Foundation Establishment ancestor stepped in.
A few days later, Lan Chang'an smoothly broke through the bottleneck and advanced to the fourth layer of Qi-Refining. This was the advantage of re-cultivation.
For an ordinary low-grade or mid-grade spiritual root without bottleneck-breaking pills, being stuck for one to two years, or even three to five years, would be considered normal. Of course, this was just a bottleneck at a minor realm.
For a major realm bottleneck like the Foundation Establishment Realm, with Lan Chang'an's current life aptitude, he would need to rely on Foundation Establishment pills as well to be on the safe side.
"Twenty-seven years old, fourth layer of Qi-Refining."
"From eighteen years old, it took two years to reach the second layer of Qi-Refining; three years to reach the third layer; four years to reach the fourth layer..."
The progression of the Evergreen Technique was indeed quite slow.
Before he knew it, Lan Chang'an had been cultivating in the Mu family for nine years.
During this period, he cultivated low-profile and avoided trouble, so he did not encounter any major issues.
What Lan Chang'an did not know was that Zheng Feng, the ugly woman of the Zheng family, had been trying to take revenge on him all these years. But she never had the opportunity. Because in these nine years, apart from that three-year appointment, Lan Chang'an had never left the Mu family's residence.
Zheng Feng was almost driven to internal bleeding from frustration.
...
Lan Chang'an's breakthrough to a minor realm caused fluctuations in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, which could not be concealed from the cultivators in the herb garden's residential area. Unless one went out to find a place to break through, it was impossible to hide one's cultivation realm.
"Congratulations Brother Chang'an on advancing to the middle stage of Qi-Refining." After leaving seclusion, Mu Yunfei was the first to offer congratulations.
"Brother Yunfei is too kind. At my age, advancing to the fourth layer of Qi-Refining is merely dull mediocrity," Lan Chang'an smiled, not exactly being modest.
The fourth layer of Qi-Refining at twenty-seven years old meant his potential was considered quite poor, with little chance of establishing a foundation in the future. Normally, one would need to reach the late stage of Qi-Refining before thirty to have a decent hope of establishing a foundation. With Lan Chang'an's current pace, it was impossible for him to reach the seventh layer of Qi-Refining before thirty. However, he had a lifespan of a hundred and eighty years in the Qi-Refining stage, so there was no need to rush.
"Brother Chang'an started late, but your cultivation has always been improving steadily, which is already admirable," said Mu Yunfei, his expression turning slightly gloomy.
Lan Chang'an could tell that Mu Yunfei had been stuck at the sixth layer of Qi-Refining for many years without being able to advance to the late stage. Compared to Lan Chang'an's slow but steady progress, this kind of stagnation was truly disheartening.
"With Brother Yunfei's tenacity, if you exchange for a bottleneck-breaking pill in the future, you will definitely be able to break through the bottleneck," Lan Chang'an offered a word of consolation.
Bottleneck-breaking pills for the late stage of Qi-Refining were rare in the Mu family, and even those with contributions had to queue up. Moreover, with Mu Yunfei missing an arm, each realm breakthrough in the future would be more difficult than normal.
...
Over the next few days, Lan Chang'an wandered around the herb garden to relax.
There had been occasional battles in the front line mining area for half a year, but luckily it had not escalated further. At least, no Foundation Establishment cultivators had appeared. The elders of both families were relatively restrained as well.
Two months ago, Li Ergou returned to the family to recuperate as an injured cultivator. Li Ergou's injury was quite peculiar. His leg was broken, but it was not caused by an enemy attack. Instead, he accidentally broke his leg while retreating from a lost battle. The only true combat injury he sustained was some minor flesh wounds.
Half a month ago, Li Ergou came to the herb garden specifically to thank Lan Chang'an and pleaded to purchase superior-grade wind speed talismans.
For ordinary talisman masters, the probability of producing superior-grade talismans was very low, so Lan Chang'an expressed difficulty and said he would sell them if he had any in the future.
According to Li Ergou, he was fortunate to have Lan Chang'an's top-grade wind speed talisman, as its effect exceeded expectations. However, it was also because the speed was too fast that Li Ergou accidentally broke his leg while retreating back to the main camp.
Fortunately, Li Ergou gained half a year to recuperate from his injuries, during which he could return to the family to reunite with his wife and children.
...
Half a month later, a family steward came to the herb garden to summon Mu Yunfei to the front line mining area.
After a year of recuperation, Mu Yunfei had only recently recovered from his injuries.
"Take care, Brother Yunfei," Lan Chang'an cupped his hands, feeling a tinge of pity in his heart. His injury had just healed, yet he had to go to the front lines again...
Mu Yunfei showed no resentment as he prepared to leave with the steward.
"No need to rush, there's something I need to announce," the steward said with a smile, his gaze falling on Lan Chang'an.
"From today onwards, the duty of guarding the herb garden will be taken up by Lan Chang'an."
"Guarding the herb garden?" Lan Chang'an's eyelid twitched, not expecting this at all. Why would the Mu family let an outsider like him take up the duty of guarding the herb garden?
"Lan Chang'an, do not decline. This is the result of the family head overruling all objections," the steward smiled.
"The family head has a high evaluation of you: 'Calm in the face of danger, prudent in thoughts'!"
Lan Chang'an had underestimated Mu Maode's boldness. Mu Maode knew Lan Chang'an's loyalty was not sufficient, and if he forcibly conscripted him to the front lines, it might backfire.
But the family was truly lacking manpower. Mu Maode appreciated Lan Chang'an's alertness displayed previously, as the younger generation within the family lacked such a nature. In this family crisis, wasting such talent would be a pity, so he might as well place Lan Chang'an in an important position.
During the years Lan Chang'an had been in the Mu family, he did not cause any trouble and cultivated while maintaining a low-profile, earning the acceptance of the Mu family in terms of character.
Mu Maode chose to take a gamble. He didn't know what kind of fate this helpless gamble would bring to the Mu Family..
...
"Brother Chang'an! I believe you can take over my position and guard the herb garden well," Mu Yunfei looked at him with trusting eyes.
Previously, the duty of guarding the herb garden was temporarily taken up by Mu Yunfei.
"Don't worry! The herb garden is in the backyard of the Feiyue Manor, and there's also Elder Ge here overseeing the pill refining side of things." The steward added reassuringly.
Having reached this point, Lan Chang'an could not decline. Previously he was only assisting in the defense, now he had become the leader. The biggest difference was that he could no longer slack off. Compared to Mu Yunfei and Li Ergou who had to go to the front lines and fight, this was still acceptable.
Nine years ago, the Mu family had taken Lan Chang'an in and provided him with access to their spirit vein and cultivation grounds. The Mu family had shown him kindness. Within reason, undertaking certain duties was only fair.
This kind of cultivation family that had a righteous ethos and could tolerate foreign surnames to inhabit it was not easy to find in the cultivation world.
"It's a good thing I didn't take a wife in the Mu family," Lan Chang'an thought, free of any attachments and able to run away at a moments notice. The Mu family could not control him.
Li Ergou's situation was different. With his wife and children in the Mu family, he had fully integrated into the Mu family over the past decade, making it difficult for him to separate from this large collective. Seeing the family in a crisis, Mu Yunfei and Li Ergou had no choice but to step up, even knowing they might have to sacrifice themselves.
...
One month later, Lan Chang'an had adapted to the duties of guarding the herb garden.
A few young Mu family cultivators in the early stages of Qi-Refining followed his arrangements. They had to inspect the formation arrays daily, and someone had to be on guard and patrol at night.
Of course, Lan Chang'an was not the highest authority in the herb garden, he was also subject to checks and balances. There were two people in the herb garden with higher status than him.
One was an elderly man with blurry vision at the fifth layer of Qi-Refining, a senior member of the Mu family's spiritual planting master.Looking at how difficult it was for him to walk, his longevity was nearing its limit, so his combat ability could not be counted on.
The other person was naturally Pill Refiner Ge Yi. At the seventh layer of Qi-Refining and a first-rank superior-grade pill refiner, his status was exalted. This man had an arrogant temperament and bad temper. In the few dealings Lan Chang'an had with him, Ge Yi was overbearing and uncivil.
Lan Chang'an tried his best to avoid him.
"Junior Lan! Why haven't you sent that two-hundred-year-old Snake Heart Grass over yet?" Ge Yi walked over with an unhappy expression.
"According to the rules, taking rare medicinal ingredients over two hundred years old requires approval from the family head," Lan Chang'an replied lazily as he lay on the grass sunbathing.
Since Ge Yi did not treat him with respect, Lan Chang'an saw no need to be polite either. The puffy eye bags and sunken eye sockets on Ge Yi's haggard face took on a sinister look in his anger.
Talking to him while lying down?
No cultivator in the Mu family had dared to be so disrespectful towards him over the years.
"This is a special period! The front lines urgently need spirit pills, there cannot be any delays..."
Recalling that Lan Chang'an was an outsider family member, only a mid-grade talisman master without much leverage, Ge Yi suppressed the anger in his heart.
"Fine! If you want you can go and get it yourself, I won't take the responsibility," Lan Chang'an said indifferently. This Pill Refiner Ge Yi often took medicinal herbs without following the rules, especially in this hectic period.
No one knew just how many herbs he had pocketed for himself. But relying on his friendship with the Foundation Establishment ancestor, the elders who previously guarded the herb garden had all treated him with courtesy.
"You lazy brat! Neglecting your duties day after day, I will definitely report you to the higher ranks of the family," Ge Yi left with a harsh reprimand before storming off in anger, going to get the precious medicinal herbs.
"Could it be that the Mu family head wanted me to act as a check on Elder Ge?" Lan Chang'an felt helpless at this outcome. He had already been low-profile and steered clear. But being in this position, there was bound to be conflict with Ge Yi.
"This old man, he must have pocketed some medicinal herbs for himself."
Soon after, Lan Chang'an saw Ge Yi taking not just the two-hundred-year-old Snake Heart Grass mentioned earlier, but several other rare medicinal ingredients.
After fetching the herbs, Ge Yi returned to his large courtyard and began to refine pills behind closed doors.
