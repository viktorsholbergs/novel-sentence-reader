Li Xiangping smiled and was about to respond as Li Yesheng entered the cave dwelling respectfully. Turning toward him, Li Xiangping asked, “What’s the matter?”
“Family Head, a group of about a dozen children from the Wan Family has descended from the mountain. They mentioned that their families were once allies and friends of ours. Now, in their time of despair, they seek our protection and support,” Li Yesheng replied.
The brothers were taken aback by the news. Li Xiangping set aside his tea bowl and with a conflicted look on his face, he asked softly, “Does anyone among them possess a spiritual orifice?”
“Qiuyang has assessed them. The leader of the group is a cultivator of the Profound Scenery stage. The rest, however, are mortals,” Li Yesheng reported.
After a moment of contemplation, Li Xiangping instructed, “Let’s integrate these Wan Family members into our villages. Those aged ten and above will receive parcels of land to establish their own homes. As for the children under ten, we’ll enroll them in the academy for now, with the younger ones placed under the care of foster families.”
“And bring the leader to meet with me directly,” he added.
Wan Tianjing led a group of children and sought refuge in the mountains for a night. Witnessing the collapse of the grand formation on Mount Huaqian filled him with despair. Recalling his clan uncle’s parting words, he led the children westward with tears in his eyes.
Throughout their silent journey, the heartache was palpable. The children who followed him were instructed to remain silent by their families, their quiet sobs punctuating the somber march.
Wan Tianjing, steering clear of the familiar village paths, scoured the wilderness for fruits and rabbits to sustain the children trailing behind him. Their journey inadvertently led them into the Li Family’s territory, prompting Wan Tianjing to seek out someone who could provide guidance and answers. It was not long before a cultivator from the Li Family appeared.
Li Qiuyang was a young cultivator in his early twenties and from the side family of the Li Family. Nevertheless, his demeanor was courteous and empathetic upon learning of their plight. He escorted Wan Tianjing to Mount Meiche, engaging in quiet conversation as they walked.
“Are all of you cultivators?” Li Qiuyang asked. He had been stuck in the Celestial Whirl stage, the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, for two or three years now but still saw no signs of an imminent breakthrough. There were not many cultivators in the Li Family for him to compare his progress, so he was curious about Wan Tianjing’s cultivation progress.
“I am currently at the Profound Scenery stage,” Wan Tianjing replied.
Li Qiuyang was instantly reassured by Wan Tianjing’s response, given that he seemed to be only fourteen or fifteen.
I guess not everyone can match Li Xuanxuan’s pace of cultivation. With just seven years of cultivation, he has reached the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at the mere age of fourteen or fifteen, he thought to himself.
The Li Family was known for their swift actions. Within moments of their brief conversation, a middle-aged man of refined presence approached to guide Wan Tianjing further.
Wan Tianjing followed him along a stone path leading up the mountain, eventually entering a cave dwelling.
Wan Tianjing lifted his gaze and saw a middle-aged man reading in his seat in the main hall.
“Family Head, I’ve brought him here.”
The middle-aged man lifted his gaze and raised his slender eyebrow. His sharp, falcon-like eyes met Wan Tianjing’s with an intensity that unsettled him. For a brief moment, Wan Tianjing felt a rush of fear, prompting him to quickly kneel in deference as he recognized the significance of the figure before him as the head of the Li Family.
Li Xiangping nodded to Li Qiuyang, then stood up. He gently set his wooden slip down and observed Wan Tianjing in silence.
Wan Tianjing broke out in a sweat, only to hear a warm voice above him saying, “Raise your head.”
Encouraged by the kindness in Li Xiangping’s voice, Wan Tianjing looked up. He saw not only the head of the Li Family but also another friendly figure beside him.
The figure had a sword on his waist and a green talisman brush in his hand. He offered a reassuring smile to Wan Tianjing.
“What’s your name?” The family head finally broke the silence.
Wan Tianjing fell into a contemplative silence for a few moments before responding with a mix of sorrow and defiance, “Wan Tianchou[1] ! My name is Wan Tianchou!”
Li Xiangping nodded, then briefly spoke with Wan Tianchou about the event that had transpired on Mount Huaqian that night before dismissing both Wan Tianchou and Li Yesheng.
Turning to Li Tongya, he remarked quietly, “He lacks courage and strategy, yet possesses some redeemable qualities. We can use him, though he’s not nearly as commendable as Wan Tiancang.”
Li Tongya shook his head, then softly added with a smile, “The Wan Family’s true threats were Wan Xiaohua and Wan Tiancang. Had either of them survived, the Wan Family might have had a chance to rise again. Alas, they perished on Mount Huaqian.”
Li Xiangping waved his hand dismissively and commented, “Unless Wan Huaqian could rise from his grave, the Wan Family’s fall is sealed. We should focus on what lies ahead.”
“Are you ready to break through to the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Second Brother?” he asked.
Li Tongya nodded and confirmed, “Just a few more days and I’ll be ready for seclusion.”
Li Xiangping prepared a pot of tea, then cleared the wooden slips from the table, making space to mark down some thoughts on a piece of cloth.
“Second Brother is on the verge of a breakthrough to the Nascent Spirit stage, the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. I, too, am about to break through to the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Our remaining family members, including Second Sister-in-Law, Li Qiuyang, and Xuanxuan, have all reached the third stage. Wan Tianchou has reached the first stage, while Xuanfeng and Chen Donghe are newly initiated into the immortal path,” he said.
“Excluding Jing’er, our current strength mirrors that of the Wan Family back then,” he concluded.
“You’re right.” Li Tongya nodded in agreement but suddenly recalled something else.
“People have reported the recent unusual movements of beasts in the western forests, including the sighting of a demonic beast. Thankfully, its cultivation was modest, and Qiuyang was able to subdue it with the villagers. I only worry this is an ominous sign.”
Li Xiangping thought for a few moments and then responded, “I’ve had scouts investigate Mount Yue, yet heard nothing. Given the historical presence of the Mount Yue tribe in that area, they might be stirring this unrest. We have to remain cautious.”
“I’ve commanded our men to delve deeper into this mystery. Hopefully, we’ll uncover something soon,” he added.
Li Tongya put the talisman ink away. Together with Li Xiangping, they exited the cave dwelling and made their way toward Mount Lijing while conversing.
Lu Jiangxian combed through the information flooding his mind. His divine sense wandered out to see the familiar sight of the stone platform and roof window.
The cracks on its reflective surface remained mostly unchanged, but there were now glittering white threads on its mirror frame. The white qi from the jade pendant did not strengthen the Supreme Yin Profound Light but bestowed upon the mirror a new ability.
This newfound ability allowed the mirror to combine the talisman qi gathered through the “Essence Conversion Technique” with the Supreme Yin moonlight to condense a talisman pill.
An immortal cultivator could only consume one pill per major cultivation realm to achieve a breakthrough in their cultivation. The extent of its effectiveness hinges on the talisman qi in the pill; it could work wonders on even cultivators of the Foundation Establishment and Purple Mansion Realms.
However, similar to the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, consuming the pill would leave a talisman mark within the consumer’s Shenyang Mansion, enhancing their ability to channel spiritual qi.
Upon the consumer’s demise, their vital qi would be transformed back into talisman qi and be reclaimed by the mirror.
“The mirror remains as resourceful as ever, capitalizing on whatever is at hand…” Reflecting on this, Lu Jiangxian sighed in defeat.
He recalled acquiring the Essence Conversion Technique years earlier. However, the stringent prerequisites proved too challenging, leaving him no choice but to wait until Li Tongya’s breakthrough to the Qi Cultivation Realm before they could attempt this.
1. A small trivia: Wan Tianjing changed his name to Wan Tianchou, the chou used here is 仇, which means revenge. ☜
