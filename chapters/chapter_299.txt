Li Yuanping left the courtyard, snapped his fan shut with a swish, and walked on with a displeased expression. Dou Yi followed closely behind, feeling as though he had caused trouble and dared not speak.
Li Yuanping suddenly stopped. Caught off guard, Dou Yi nearly stumbled into him. "Young Master! Young Master!" he called out hurriedly.
"Shut up!" Li Yuanping hissed, using his fan to steady the man, frowning slightly. He then said softly, "Which idiot from the Dou Family took it upon themselves to replace that Liu Family member? You nearly made me lose face in front of my elder brother... If Mother finds out, she will surely have you all punished!"
Dou Yi knew he would have to stay by Li Yuanping's side from now on, but could not bear to blame his father, so he merely stammered in response, "Y-yes...Yes..."
Li Yuanping waved his hand gently and turned his head as he walked, saying, "You do not need to tell me… I know it was probably Old Master Dou. When people get old and gain power, they start scheming more."
Dou Yi quickly followed, replying respectfully, "This was also for your benefit, Young Master. The Clan Affairs Courtyard has always been the stepping stone to becoming the family head… Young Master Yuanjiao has often expressed his desire to relinquish his authority. Now that you are in charge of the Clan Affairs Courtyard, it's only a matter of time before you ascend to the family head! Father simply wanted to place more people to help you."
"Heh," Li Yuanping chuckled, amused. "You speak with such certainty. Your father isn't trying to help me; he's trying to sabotage me! If he truly wanted to help, he would patiently wait three years. There's no need for him to meddle now."
He frowned and looked at the guilt-ridden Dou Yi before saying, "Your father is merely using this as an excuse to expand his influence… Why does he need to do so under the guise of helping me? Your family is my maternal family. When I assume leadership, you will naturally have your place. There's no need for all this… Don't assume I am young and easily deceived."
Dou Yi quickly broke out into a cold sweat. Li Yuanping, waving his fan, continued calmly, "Let us set that aside. I do not care who sent you. Since my elder brother has assigned you to me, you will work for me from now on. Forget about your Dou Family."
Dou Yi was stunned. What Li Yuanping said was completely different from what his father had instructed. Old Master Dou had always told him, "Young Master Yuanping and Madam Dou are the pillars of our Dou Family. Rely on them to secure more power for our family... In the future, our Dou Family will rise to prominence."
Hearing Li Yuanping's tone now, it was clear that neither he nor Madam Dou regarded the Dou Family as supporters. Instead, they were guarded against them, fearing that the Dou Family might drag them down! Dou Yi felt a pang of bitterness and said mournfully, "Young Master, the Dou Family is entirely at your command and only listens to you... Back then, the Tian and Liu families rose with the tide. Distant relatives are also your arms… Why push them away?"
Unexpectedly, Li Yuanping stopped and looked back at him with interest sparkling in his eyes as he smiled and said, "Cousin… My surname is Li! I am a legitimate son of the main family."
With that, he turned and walked away. Dou Yi, startled, dared not speak further and just followed him closely.
The two walked through the mountains for a while and entered a brightly lit large courtyard. Li Yuanping waited at the courtyard entrance for a moment until a female servant hurried out carrying a basin of water. He asked gently, "Has Mother gone to sleep?"
"Madam has washed her feet and is waiting for you in her room!" the female servant answered hastily.
Dou Yi immediately understood that this was Madam Dou's courtyard. Remembering his father's foolish actions and his aunt's tough nature, his legs trembled, and he lamented silently.
My foolish father has caused trouble, yet I have to pay for it. What a plight!
Li Yuanping paid no heed to him and led him into the courtyard. They were greeted by a scene of layers upon layers of pale yellow drapery, with flickering lights and a faint scent of incense wafting through the air. Two female servants stood obediently by the bed.
Li Yuanping kneeled respectfully and greeted softly, "I've arrived, Mother. Congratulations on your breakthrough… The Qi Cultivation Realm is certainly within your reach!"
Madam Dou, sitting upright at the head, was dressed in luxurious clothing, her appearance youthful. Her aura had reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, and she was now just a step away from the Qi Cultivation Realm, making her one of the most formidable among the external cultivators.
Over the years, Madam Dou had skillfully managed to keep Li Xuanxuan's numerous wives and concubines in check, while also elevating her own family's status in agriculture. Simultaneously, she continued to advance her own cultivation.
"No need for formalities, Ping'er."
Though Madam Dou was known for her stern demeanor, she was unreservedly affectionate toward her child. She immediately invited him to sit. Li Yuanping nodded and recounted the evening's events, including the details of Li Xuanxuan's letter.
Madam Dou listened intently, and by the end, Dou Yi felt his scalp tingle. He glanced up timidly, only to meet a pair of eyes that were as cold and piercing as starlight.
"Come here." Madam Dou's voice was gentle. Dou Yi quickly stood before his aunt. A delicate hand with long nails stained with balsam flowers emerged from behind the drapery. Dou Yi stared blankly at the hand, and with a light flick, Madam Dou beckoned him closer.
SLAP!
Dou Yi received a solid slap across his face, leaving half of it bright red. He dared not show any anger, only bowing repeatedly and pleading, "Mercy, Auntie! Mercy!"
Madam Dou's words drifted gently to his ears. "Go back and deliver this slap to your father. Tell him this…"
She parted her red lips and slowly uttered the words: "Try something funny again and his life will be as good as gone."
Meanwhile on Mount Yuting…
Li Qinghong exhaled deeply, her breath visible as a stream of white in the air. The long spear resting on her knees shimmered with mana light. Opening her eyes, which had been nurtured by mana, they sparkled brightly in the dark chamber.
"Second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm…" she mumbled softly.
For the past five years, Li Qinghong had mostly stayed on the mountain to cultivate. She had broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm in the first three years and then reached the second heavenly layer in the subsequent two.
Now in her early twenties, her cultivation speed was notably swift compared to the usual three to five years typically needed for each heavenly layer. Only Li Yuanjiao had progressed slightly faster than her, aided by the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit talisman.
Rising with her spear, a faint purple hue coursed through her eyes, enhancing her already captivating appearance. As a former Grade Four thunder technique, the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique,
made Li Qinghong's aura exceptionally strong, far surpassing the usual Qi Cultivation Realm of the second heavenly layer.
"Clan Sister..."
A man stood cautiously outside the stone chamber. He was one of Li Xuanxuan's concubine-born sons, lacking a spiritual orifice. Among Li Xuanxuan's numerous offspring, he had little presence and had been sent to manage a town on Mount Yuting.
Li Qinghong's red lips parted slightly, commanding curtly, "Speak."
The man respectfully replied, "Recently, men have been disappearing. For three months, clan cultivators have investigated but found nothing. Three days ago, nine families perished suddenly... We've reported to the main family and were granted permission to seek your aid, Clan Sister."
Li Qinghong nodded slightly and asked in confusion, "What about Uncle?"
The man understood she was referring to Chen Donghe and answered hurriedly, "He has gone to the market with Elder An, to send the furs and spirit items. The Family Head is searching for mountains within the Mount Yue region. We are unsure if he has returned, so..."
"All right." Li Qinghong nodded before taking him up with her in the wind and began asking for more details about the situation.
For the first time in his life, the man experienced the thrill of riding the wind. Looking down at the small town and the passing clouds and birds, a sense of envy overwhelmed him. He eagerly answered Li Qinghong's questions, pointing out directions while feeling a rush of exhilaration.
Following his directions, Li Qinghong descended to find several empty houses with traces of blood left on the ground. With a swift glance, her dharma eyes detected many peculiarities beneath her feet. She set down her clan brother, then with a graceful movement, sketched several runes in the air before casting a talisman.
