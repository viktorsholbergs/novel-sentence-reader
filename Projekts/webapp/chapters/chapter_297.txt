Li Xuanfeng was transferred to the southern border. Li Tongya's wife, Liu Rouxuan, only lasted a few months before she died on the mountain. Li Tongya stayed by her bedside the entire time.
With tears in her eyes, Liu Rouxuan had managed to stammer out a final sentence before she passed away.
"My dear, you still have over two hundred years to live… I hope you will marry again after I am gone. Do not overly favor the Liu Family, as too much kindness could lead to disaster."
Li Tongya sat quietly by the bed, speaking gently, but Liu Rouxuan had already stopped breathing. Their son, Li Xuanling, wept bitterly at her side. Li Yuanyun, who was in Eastern Mount Yue, and Li Qinghong, stationed at Mount Yuting, managed to rush back in time to shed silent tears at her bedside.
Liu Rouxuan's face bore little resemblance to the one that had once asked Li Tongya, "Do you love me?" in the small courtyard. Her eyes were lifeless, her mouth stiff, and her face marked by deep wrinkles. Yet her withered hands clung to Li Tongya's, holding on tightly, even in death.
The entire Li Family of Lijing mourned deeply, draping white cloth throughout their residence. Meanwhile, the Liu Family was engulfed in terror. For decades, they had produced no notable talents; their courtyard was dominated by playboys who only cared about the pleasures of life.
The death of Liu Rouxuan sent the Liu Family into a spiral of panic and fear, with members crying out "Grandmother is gone" throughout their estate. When her last words were spread down the mountain, everyone became even more anxious, and resentful murmurs filled the air.
Li Tongya buried Liu Rouxuan, looked at the gathered members of the Li Family who had rushed back, and removed the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword, which was glowing with mana light, from his waist.
He announced softly, "I will now go into seclusion for cultivation and may not come out for several years, or even decades… This dharma sword will only gather dust with me, so I will leave it with all of you."
"Yuanjiao!" he called out.
Li Yuanjiao quickly raised his head and stepped forward, receiving the dharma sword with both hands. Li Tongya then said softly, "Among all the disciples, you are the most talented swordsman. Take this with you and use it well."
Li Yuanjiao was deeply moved, not expecting Li Tongya to give the sword to him instead of his own son, Li Xuanling. He wanted to decline, but Li Tongya waved his hand and pushed him back to his seat, continuing, "Now, you are the eldest brother here. Take good care of your younger siblings and do not disappoint me."
He then turned to Li Xuanxuan, paused thoughtfully, and handed him a storage pouch tied at his waist. "I have reviewed the tributes that prestigious clans are expected to pay... The amount far exceeds what the current Li Family can afford. We need to pay the next five years' tribute by next year. Inside this pouch, you'll find dharma artifacts and spirit items I've collected over the years. Take them to the market and sell them to cover this gap."
Li Xuanxuan nodded obediently as Li Tongya continued, "This is not a sustainable solution. I've made some preliminary arrangements at the Cloud Crowned Peak market. There's a small shop there looking to form an alliance with our Li Family. Go there immediately, finalize the arrangements, and forge a new path for our family to earn Spirit Stones. Take the talismans you've crafted over the years to sell. Since you are not inclined toward cultivation, you will stay there to draw talismans. Leave family matters to the younger generation."
Li Xuanxuan had no objections and nodded in agreement. Li Tongya then instructed Li Xuanling, "Try your best to assist your brother as much as possible when you're not cultivating."
Seeing everyone nod in agreement, Li Tongya straightened up and said gently, "Work hard in your cultivation and take good care of each other."
"Yes!" Everyone responded in unison, and before the echoes faded, Li Tongya's figure had already disappeared. Li Xuanling wiped away his tears and exchanged a glance with Li Xuanxuan. Without further delay, they rode the wind toward Cloud Crowned Peak together.
The few members of the Yuan and Qing generation gathered together, encouraging each other before heading down the mountain.
The lights on Mount Lijing flickered.
The brilliant dawn rose from the horizon, illuminating the Li Family's territory. Smoke rose from the houses at the foot of the mountain, marking the arrival of a new day.
Eastern Mount Yue was characterized by many mountains and few fields, making it unsuitable for sustaining a population. There were, however, numerous small hills and earth veins. Li Yuanjiao had been surveying the area for several months, from west to east, probing each vein of spiritual energy. Finally, he found a suitable small mountain.
"Mount Wutu."
Li Yuanjiao rose into the wind, lightly circling the location on the map in his hand. He estimated the distance, examined the veins and spiritual energy, nodded slowly, and descended to the foot of the mountain.
At the foot of the mountain stood a woman of noble bearing, her phoenix eyes radiating brilliance. She wore a graceful dress and held a boy, about five or six years old, who looked smart and handsome. He was peering around curiously. As soon as Li Yuanjiao landed, the boy jumped and shouted, "Dad! This mountain looks like a bird!"
This boy was Li Yuanjiao's son, named Li Xizhi, now over four years old. He was well-behaved and adorable, greatly loved by Li Yuanjiao and his wife.
"Hahahaha!" Li Yuanjiao laughed heartily.
Beside him, Xiao Guiluan gently asked, "How is it?"
"The veins and spiritual energy are sufficient. It is not inferior to Mount Lijing, and it is one of the best in Eastern Mount Yue," Li Yuanjiao replied, then continued, "According to the ancient texts, the spirit fields on Mount Wutu are fertile and intact… There is no better place within Eastern Mount Yue."
"Then let us settle here..." Xiao Guiluan's eyebrows showed a trace of worry as she whispered, "The clan's tribute is too heavy. We have been running at a loss every year… We cannot afford to waste any more time."
Li Yuanjiao fell silent for a moment, then nodded in agreement.
"Indeed."
Five years had passed in the blink of an eye. The lake remained relatively peaceful during this time. The Yu Family had relaxed their control and tribute demands on the eastern shore families, retreating into Milin Prefecture and becoming quiet. The Li Family quietly digested the territories of Mount Huazhong and Mount Yuting, enjoying a period of calmness.
During these five years, Li Qinghong and Li Yuanjiao had both broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. Most of the Yuan generation had children, and even Li Yuanjiao's several half-brothers had children who were now seven years old. Unfortunately, their talents were disappointing. Even those with spiritual orifices showed little promise, causing Li Yuanjiao to shake his head in dismay.
Li Xuanxuan had been stationed at the market for years now, rarely returning. Despite his reluctance, Li Yuanjiao had to take over family affairs, temporarily acting as the head of the family.
Xiao Guiluan, holding Li Xizhi, watched Li Yuanjiao rise with the wind. They exchanged a glance, and Xiao Guiluan said, "There is one thing I have to tell you, my dear. The people from Mount Yu told me that they needed to craft dharma artifacts and should be able to use our ebony ore. If we can supply enough, we could get a premium rate of ten to twenty percent."
Li Yuanjiao's eyes immediately lit up with joy.
"Good! If this works out, we can replenish our funds and reduce the need to draw from the family treasury."
With the Yu Family's decline on the lake, a tripartite balance of power had emerged. For the Li Family, their greatest challenge had become the tribute payments to the Azure Pond Sect. The tribute demanded of a clan was now more than ten times what it had been during the Qi Cultivation Realm period, far exceeding the Li Family's current income.
Unlike other Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators like Yu Yufeng, Li Tongya never demanded resources, otherwise Li Yuanjiao would have had to sell off the entire Li Family to support him in his cultivation.
Despite this, Li Yuanjiao was still constantly burdened with worries about the family's financial deficit. Hearing that Xiao Guiluan had found a way to earn Spirit Stones, he could not help but praise her.
Seeing Xiao Guiluan smile silently, Li Yuanjiao suddenly paused, a smile tugging at his lips as he said, "That Xiao Xian is from the Mount Yu branch of the Xiao Family, isn't he?"
"Heh." Xiao Guiluan, who had been managing the family with Li Yuanjiao for five years, responded with a soft laugh, her phoenix eyes twinkling as she said gently, "That boy's intention is quite obvious! He runs to our Lijing Town every month just to find an excuse to see Qingxiao. Now that the Mount Yu branch has sent him to handle this matter, he is overjoyed."
