"Mother, I've returned!"
Li Yuanjiao's cheerful voice came from outside the door.
"It's the young master!" the servant girl exclaimed happily as Mu Yalu quickly stood up and walked to the door, gently pushing it open to see Li Yuanjiao standing there with a beaming smile.
"Jiao'er!"
Mu Yalu stepped forward to embrace him, softly asking, "Are you accustomed to living on the mountain this year?"
"It's been all right! My siblings have all been quite nice to me," Li Yuanjiao chuckled and swiftly entered the courtyard to sit beside the stone table, taking the teacup in his hands. He quietly asked, "Has Father been in seclusion on the mountain this year? Has anyone troubled you at home?"
"Not at all," Mu Yalu replied with a soft voice, refilling his cup with water.
Li Yuanjiao sighed in relief as he continued, "Stepmother has been quite kind to you. There haven't been any petty schemes in the family, which has really eased my mind. At least Brother and I won't have to worry about it!"
As Mu Yalu nodded and smiled, Li Yuanjiao paused before seriously adding, "I've been dealing with affairs in the Clan Affairs Courtyard with brother these past few days and learned quite a lot."
Mu Yalu raised an eyebrow at him, observing as Li Yuanjiao put down his teacup. He then whispered, "Mother, have you sent someone to inquire about Shamoli's news?"
Mu Yalu was momentarily shocked, nodding with a hint of unease before she responded meekly, "Yes..."
Li Yuanjiao shook his head, advising, "Mother, given your sensitive status, it's better to have someone ask me these things directly on the mountain. In the future, avoid inquiring yourself. Li Family's territory is not like Eastern Mount Yue; the Clan Affairs Courtyard has many eyes and ears around. I'm afraid you might inadvertently give them something to hold against you, Mother…"
Mu Yalu was instantly alarmed and anxious, her voice filled with concern as she asked, "Could this lead to any consequences?! Has Mother caused you trouble?"
"It's nothing serious," Li Yuanjiao reassured, taking a sip of his tea and smiling. "It's not a big deal. Besides, Brother gave me that secret letter to handle myself. I just wanted to remind Mother," he continued with a small grin.
"That's a relief."
Mu Yalu sighed softly. After a brief exchange, she had the servant girl leave and then softly asked, "Does… Lord Yuanxiu treat you the same as before?"
"Yes," Li Yuanjiao's voice lowered in response, "In our family, where only my brother from the direct lineage can cultivate and with the family being sparse in numbers—regardless of legitimacy or gender—all descendants with spiritual orifices are treated equally. I haven't faced any mistreatment; on the contrary, I've received tremendous benefits!"
"That's very good," Mu Yalu visibly relaxed, only for Li Yuanjiao to continue, "I've heard that the family is considering adopting me into fourth granduncle's line, who is solely focused on his cultivation in the southern border without any interest in taking a wife for himself. I came today to get your opinion on this matter…"
"What?!" Mu Yalu was stunned, feeling as though fortune had suddenly smiled upon her. She asked hesitantly, "You're talking about... the Qingsui Sword Immortal?"
"Yes."
Li Yuanjiao was quite shocked himself when Li Xuanling confided in him about this intention. Observing his mother's disbelief, he softly added, "Father… He has agreed to it. If you are fine with it, I'll become the direct descendant of the fourth lineage, which will be greatly beneficial in the future."
"Good."
Mu Yalu nodded as she heard this, her primary concern always being her son's well-being, thus agreeing without hesitation. After pondering for a moment, she whispered, "That way, you could compete with Yuanxiu for the position of the young clan head..."
"Mother, you must not speak nonsense!" Li Yuanjiao shook his head firmly, stating, "I respect my brother the most. The position of the young clan head can only be his. In this life, I only wish to support him well—with no other intentions."
"That's fine too," Mu Yalu replied with a smile, thinking about how to convey these exact words to the main household.
"However, regarding Shamoli, he's quite the pleasure-seeker…"
The mother and son discussed further regarding the newcomer, with Li Yuanjiao detailing Shamoli's personality.
"Not everyone can be adept at human relations. The Li Family is only kind to its own and those under its rule. Shamoli, falling into you and your brother's hands, is rather unfortunate!" Mu Yalu laughed.
"What's there to pity about him when he's being handed a throne on a silver platter?" Li Yuanjiao dismissed, laughing heartily.
Mu Yalu watched him with a joyful eye, from Li Xuanxuan to Li Yuanxiu, she realized that both were not at all simple-minded men.
She thought to herself, Every one of the Li Family is cunning and bad, focusing outward for now… By the sixth or eighth generation, when kinship thins, internal strife will surely happen. Fortunately, my son was born early and is thus spared from having to compete with similarly shrewd characters.
Atop Mount Lijing, Li Tongya stepped through the air, his figure shifting like a phantom. Around him, several reflections that looked like water gleamed, floating around his figure for a moment before dissipating with a soft splash.
"I've finally mastered the River Crossing Torrential Step! Now, I have an added layer of protection against enemies… Unless facing against a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, I can escape with ease even if I can't win," Li Tongya mumbled to himself gleefully.
The River Crossing Torrential Step had three stages. The initial stage was not too challenging, but it became significantly more difficult with progression. It took Li Tongya seven to eight years just to master the first stage.
Li Tongya's practice of the River One Qi Technique from Lingyu Gate, a foundational technique that shared origins with this footwork technique, should have sped up his training.
However, these past few years, his focus was on cultivation, aiming to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before sixty. Thus, this footwork technique was only revisited during cultivation bottlenecks, taking him seven to eight years to master what should have taken three to four.
Only Li Xuanling from within the family showed a natural aptitude for this technique, mastering it early on. No other clan members were known to have succeeded.
"It's unbelievable that among the vast Li Family, no one could master the Pill Flame Secret Art and produce a Pill Flame…"
Li Tongya thought again. Among the members of the Xiao Family, far larger than the Li Family, only Xiao Chuting and Xiao Yuansi could conjure the Pill Flame. This put things into perspective for him.
"No wonder Yu Muxian of the Azure Pond Sect is so valued by the Yu Family… I'm guessing there are also certain conditions to meet before one can refine artifacts."
Just as Li Tongya settled on the mountainside, a voice transmission entered the formation, echoing in the cave dwelling.
"An Zheyan from the An Family is here to visit. Please open the formation, Brother Tongya!"
"An Zheyan..?"
Li Tongya paused momentarily. He had little interaction with this individual, having only divided the Lu Family's assets in tacit agreement. He wondered about the purpose of today's visit.
After opening the formation, Li Tongya sat for a moment. Soon, Li Xuanling led An Zheyan inside. Li Tongya glanced at him and courteously said, "Greetings, Brother Zheyan."
"No need for formality, Brother Tongya!" An Zheyan grinned, returning the greeting. His bald head was now adorned with a gray-white leather hat that made him look less like a butcher from the secular world, but more like a wealthy landlord.
"Word has it that Brother Tongya has broken through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Truly remarkable!"
An Zheyan, taking the offered tea, smiled. It had been decades since their last meeting. Back then, their cultivation realms were comparable, but now An Zheyan was at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm while Li Tongya had already reached the eighth.
"You're flattering me, Brother Zheyan…" Li Tongya replied with a shallow smile. He decided to cut to the chase.
"What brings Brother Zheyan here today?"
