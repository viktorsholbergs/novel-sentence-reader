"Moo~"
The big black ox kept rubbing against Chen Xun. It didn't understand the cruelty of war; it thought it was like the fights in the Southern Dipper Mountains. Chen Xun also didn't elaborate on too many details.
"Let's continue pulling threads first; this is a good thing."
"Moo~"
They became busy again. This Thousand Silk Spirit Vine was harvested from the bottom of the Initial Frost Lake in the Spirit Medicine Garden. It had various uses.
Its age of several hundred years made it suitable for alchemy and could even be used as a material for magical instruments because its silver threads had a special function â€“ shielding divine consciousness.
After staying in the Five Elements Sect for hundreds of years, they finally encountered it. This was the advantage of having a long lifespan. The items used to block divine consciousness in the Contribution Hall were not very suitable for them.
There were items like jade pendants and strange stones, mostly used to block the investigation of cultivation levels.
Better items wouldn't be casually exchanged by the sect, as these materials were not renewable. Every exchange meant one less item.
"Old Ox, let's try the effect of this Thousand-Year Thousand Silk Spirit Vine first."
Putting aside distracting thoughts, Chen Xun's gaze focused slightly. This spirit vine was cultivated over a long period, but the production of silver threads was quite small and could only be slowly collected.
The Qian Nation cultivation world had long abandoned the use of silver threads for purposes like Chen Xun and the big black ox. They were only used as auxiliary items.
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded in agreement and began to sit on the side, continuing to pull threads.
However, the growth of medicinal herbs also had its limits. They could only start by trying the Thousand-Year variety first, and later, they could gradually increase to the next level. There was no need to be hasty.
Chen Xun and the big black ox paused their cultivation, just to calm their emotions. Some things were inevitable in their immortal lives.
Apart from cultivating spiritual herbs and extracting silver threads daily, the rest of their time was spent on the mountain peak during the sunset, gazing towards the north for several hours.
There were constant reinforcements from the top ten immortal sects, but it was said that they encountered some obstacles, and the progress of the battle was not smooth.
The strength of the Wu Nation's cultivation world was not much weaker than that of the Qian Nation, or else the war wouldn't have been deadlocked for so many years.
Chen Xun was still standing with the big black ox every day on the mountaintop, looking towards the north.
...
Time passed like morning clouds, and ten years had already passed since the Qian Nation and the Wu Nation went to war.
The Five Elements Sect occasionally sent people to bring back dead cultivators from the battlefield. Some had mutilated bodies, while others left only a piece of clothing or a magical instrument...
Chen Xun and the big black ox had never experienced war, but their blood-stained robes were enough to make their eyes tremble.
Ten years later, the great war was still ongoing, and it was said to have reached within the borders of the Wu Nation. The war between the two nations was still intense.
No news came from Stone Jing and Ji Kun, and with the frontline being so long and chaotic, their fate was unknown.
Chen Xun and the big black ox also started their old profession in the Five Elements Sect, as Foundation Establishment cultivators could only take care of the sect's logistics.
The sound of a suona and bells echoed through the mountains and fields, letting the deceased cultivators rest in peace on Xianyin Mountain. Some people even had no idea about their names; they were just buried under a mound.
Perhaps among these people were Stone Jing and Ji Kun, who knows.
But Chen Xun, while saying that he had already let go, was giving himself advance comfort. If the identity wasn't confirmed, that meant they weren't dead. Chen Xun always held on to that last shred of hope.
They added the immortal points they gained over the years to speed and strength.
Their current immortal points:
Strength 25, Speed 50, Essence of All Things 50, Spiritual Energy 51, Defense 50.
In the Yuzhu Mountain Range, the mountains that emerged from the clouds resembled clusters of islands floating in the air.
On a mountain peak, a person and an ox sat on the ground.
"Old Ox, now I understand. At that time, I was too biased, too impulsive."
Chen Xun laughed calmly, looking at the big black ox, who had a puzzled expression. He gently patted its back. "At that time, we were just protecting our home and country."
"Moo!" The big black ox snorted forcefully; it didn't charge into battle for the sake of going to battle.
"The truth is, the Qian Nation's cultivation world wanted to seize immortal resources, and we got caught up in it. The Wu Nation hasn't attacked us till now."
Chen Xun looked into the distance and said calmly, "Others are fighting for their lives. In the future, we don't need to participate in such matters. Don't express any opinions either."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox grinned, and seeing Chen Xun had figured it out made it happy.
"Look at you. Brother Xun, you've been alive for so many years. Are you living in vain?"
"Moo?!"
The big black ox called out to Chen Xun. Clearly, at that time, you were the most excited, almost having a special boat prepared just for you.
"Old Ox, can't I be passionate once?"
Chen Xun looked a bit embarrassed and hurriedly explained, "Which man hasn't had the thought of going to battle to protect his home and country?"
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox suddenly ran, its two big eyes slightly curved. It didn't care; as long as it could follow Chen Xun, it wouldn't hesitate, even if it had to go through fire and water.
"Old Ox, let's go, back to cultivation we go. The road is still long."
Chen Xun slowly stood up, exhaled a breath, and said, "Our big treasure is about to be born. This will be the thing we rely on for meals in the future."
"Moo~" The big black ox bit a rope and put it in Chen Xun's hands. Then they walked down the mountain.
Now they had already advanced further into the Foundation Establishment stage, but due to Foundation Establishment Pills, their foundation seemed quite solid.
The improvement in cultivation became somewhat slower, and Chen Xun and the big black ox often discussed the changes in their cultivation. Their little notebook was filled.
However, this situation made Chen Xun very happy. They weren't lacking time or spiritual herbs and pills. What was lacking was how to take each step steadily.
With the Five Elements Spiritual Roots, a broadened liquid dantian, and the attitude of longevity, Chen Xun only said two words at the time: perfect.
The big black ox, after hearing it, inexplicably became happy. That night, they were so excited that they didn't rest; they went to the mountains and cut down a large area of Crane Spirit Trees.
They felt extremely relaxed the next day, and for venting, cutting down the Crane Spirit Trees was the most invigorating.
Today, after returning to the Spirit Medicine Garden, they quietly walked to a secluded cave.
The fragrance of the big black ox's hoof technique filled the air, and the entire cave was full of spiraling flags. It roared, and a clear breeze swept through the cave, with countless green smokes drifting.
A huge coffin made of Crane Spirit Trees slowly appeared on the open ground... No, it's a medicine box.
"Old Ox, open it!" Chen Xun's face showed excitement as he licked his lips.
"Moo!"
The big black ox stood up, lifted a hoof, and the lid of the medicine box directly soared into the sky. Inside, a robust Thousand Silk Spirit Vine appeared.
The whole cave instantly became filled with spiritual energy, and the fragrance of the Thousand Silk Spirit Vine pervaded everywhere. It had qualitatively changed, becoming dark and translucent, like a magnificent work of art.
The extreme age of the Thousand Silk Spirit Vine, a thousand years!
"Hahaha, big treasure."
Chen Xun's eyes sparkled, laughing wildly. "Old Ox, let's go in and pull the threads."
"Moo~" The big black ox was also quite excited. A thousand-year-old spiritual herb wasn't even on the auction list in Yuxu City; at most, there were only thousand-year-old spiritual herbs.
If taken out, Chen Xun told it that it was at least a major war in the cultivation world.
Boom.
After they entered, the lid of the medicine box directly slammed down, and the entire cave became quiet. There was no longer the scent of medicine in the air.
Only the medicine box, like a large coffin, still stood quietly there.
And the Thousand-Year Thousand Silk Spirit Vine could no longer be opened with magical instruments. They could only slowly refine it using enhanced alchemical fire.
Otherwise, with their current strength, even with a thousand-year spiritual herb, they could only stare blankly without the use of enhanced alchemical fire.
One by one, the darkened threads were continuously refined and extracted. Plain and unadorned, Chen Xun and the big black ox became more and more excited inside the large medicine box.
In the glow of the fire, a man and an ox unexpectedly revealed bloodthirsty smiles, truly understanding each other's minds.
