Guo Hongyao spoke with biting sarcasm while Li Xijun restrained the Hooked Snake before him.
The female cultivator was a disciple of the immortal gate and they were without the protection of a formation. If a fight were to break out, it could spell disaster. Hence, Li Xijun had no choice but to speak courteously.
"This is our fault, but the Hooked Serpent is my elder's spirit beast, so I'm afraid we can't simply surrender him to appease you. Please reconsider, Senior."
Hearing this, Guo Hongyao's arrogance seemed to deflate. She scanned the group before turning to Xu Xiao.
"Bring the Six Ding Merging Fire Token here," Guo Hongyao demanded.
The Li Family still had considerable influence, and Guo Hongyao was wary of the looming threat of sword qi or a talisman.
Intent on securing the artifact for herself after such a long journey, she reached out, but her hand closed in on air.
"Hmm?"
Guo Hongyao snapped her head and glanced over quickly, only to see Xu Xiao smiling.
"Senior... this spirit artifact has already recognized me as its master. I'm afraid I can't hand it over," he explained softly.
This spirit artifact was the source of Xu Xiao's strength, and giving it up was naturally out of the question.
Although Guo Hongyao had saved his life, Xu Xiao knew that everyone coveted the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact so he clearly was not going to hand it over so easily.
Guo Hongyao hummed in acknowledgment and feigned indifference. However, a flicker of impatience flashed across her face as she turned away from Xu Xiao.
Hmph, you're just a lucky guy… How dare you talk back to me here?! Without my Martial Granduncle's method to enhance your cultivation, what threat could you possibly pose?
Turning back to the others, Guo Hongyao had to console him with a smile.
"Xu Xiao, what should their punishment be?" she asked.
Distracted by thoughts of Liu Lingzhen, Xu Xiao replied, "Someone I know is still waiting at the foot of the mountain. I need to bring her here first."
Guo Hongyao had not expected Xu Xiao to say that and suppressed her growing impatience. He shot a look at Li Xijun and snapped, "Make it quick then!"
Li Xijun saw his opportunity to escape the tension, but Guo Hongyao was not about to let him slip away. She gestured with her hand, commanding, "You stay. Let the others go."
Chen Mufeng quietly descended the mountain to fetch Liu Lingzhen, and Xu Xiao immediately rushed over on the wind to meet her.
Seeing Xu Xiao leaving Guo Hongyao's side, Li Xijun discreetly stepped aside.
Xu Xiao and Liu Lingzhen exchanged a few sweet words before Xu Xiao lifted his head and glared at Li Xijun.
Guo Hongyao, observing the exchange, furrowed her brow and asked, "Anything else?"
Li Xijun was secretly worried but felt a sudden heat at his waist—the tracking jade pendant was warming up. He discreetly covered it with his sleeve, blocking the faint glow while suppressing his delight.
The elders are coming!
As Xu Xiao was about to return to Guo Hongyao's side, Li Xijun stepped forward, deliberately stalling him with a question.
"Does Lady Liu and the Xu Family have any friends or relatives in town? Perhaps we should bring them along as well?"
Xu Xiao frowned but Liu Lingzhen seemed delighted.
"Brother Xu, isn't that wonderful? Why don't you bring all your brothers to enjoy the splendors of the immortal gate?" she suggested.
Guo Hongyao's expression soured. Sensing her displeasure, Xu Xiao quickly shook his head and said, "Haven't you seen what kind of people they are? They have no place in the immortal gate."
Growing annoyed by the couple's exchange, Guo Hongyao turned to Li Xijun and demanded, "Give me that sword!"
Li Xijun feigned reluctance, but Guo Hongyao was in no mood for further delays. With a hand gesture, the sword on Li Xijun's back rose to the air, struggling briefly before settling in her grasp.
"What a fine sword," she praised, admiring the beautiful sword that shimmered like a pool of cold water.
Yet, Li Xijun remained stoic, neither pleading nor begging her.
This vexed Guo Hongyao and she began wondering whether this punishment might have been too lenient.
Let's see how long you can put up that act!
Raised in luxury, Guo Hongyao had never known defiance; others always bent to her will. Arrogant and domineering by nature, she now turned the gleaming blade of her sharp sword toward Li Xijun, pointing it at his throat from a distance.
The silent threat was palpable, hanging heavily in the air like a promise of violence.
Just then, a hiss filled the air.
Li Wushao, transformed into his true form—a massive Hooked Serpent—glared at her dangerously with his eyes that were as large as windows.
Guo Hongyao sneered at him.
"You think you can… hmm...? Who's there?!"
Her words were cut off as a streak of violet light split the sky, illuminating the scene with a brilliant white and purple hue. Before she could react further, a cold voice thundered, "How dare you, bitch!"
Guo Hongyao was enraged. She turned to the source of the voice and her gaze landed on a female cultivator arriving on a thunderbolt.
She was clad in jade armor and matching boots, and her long hair streamed with purple lightning, casting several silver-white halos around her.
She looked nothing short of heroic.
Her voice, clear and resonant, stunned everyone.
Guo Hongyao, feeling the sting of insult, lowered the sword and stared at the approaching purple light.
Li Qinghong had traveled thousands of li, only to find her nephew threatened by a sword held by a Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator. His subordinates appeared deeply troubled as if they were facing a formidable enemy.
Overcome with shock and rage, Li Qinghong was at a loss for words. In her fury, she opened her mouth and unleashed a beam of white light.
BOOM!
The white light swelled instantly, radiating a destructive aura. Upon contact, purple lightning cascaded down like a waterfall.
Guo Hongyao was caught off guard. The thin jade piece in her hand glowed red faintly as she reached out in a futile attempt to defend herself.
"Aunt is here!"
Li Xijun, having prepared for this moment, quickly seized the Hooked Serpent and bellowed, "Kill him first! Kill him!"
Caught by surprise, Li Wushao immediately sprung into action with his long hooks. He had actually been accumulating his strength to attack Guo Hongyao, but now swiftly changed his target to Xu Xiao as instructed.
The hooks sliced through the air with a piercing shriek.
Xu Xiao, unable to react in time, stepped back and raised a token, emitting a burst of red light. The prolonged battle had depleted his sea of qi, leaving the red light flickering weakly. As a result, the hooks easily penetrated the barrier like it was just a piece of rotten tofu.
The shields that could once defend against Foundation Establishment Realm attacks were already spent against earlier assaults.
Xu Xiao felt a crushing blow to his chest as the tail of the Hooked Serpent impaled him mercilessly.
"BROTHER XU!"
Liu Lingzhen was even slower to react. As she lunged forward, a sharp, agonizing chill ran through Xu Xiao's throat—the second tail of the Hooked Serpent had already sliced through his body, severing his head.
Xu Xiao's eyes widened with terror as the last vestiges of his consciousness flickered through his mind, replaying scenes like ephemeral dream bubbles.
Holding beauty in my arms... Trampling prestigious clans... Joining an immortal gate...
One moment he was conquering Mount Qingdu and crushing Lijing Town, and the next he was embracing Lingzhen and Hongyao in his arms.
In the end, the last thought that crossed his mind was…
Why did it end like this... Things shouldn't have gone this way…
"MERCY!"
Guo Hongyao's plea was lost in the roar of the thunderstorm, unheard over the chaos. Everyone watched as Xu Xiao's head fell, disintegrating into ashes amidst the tempest.
His death was swift; Liu Lingzhen, losing the support of the dharma wind, screamed as she plummeted downward. Every bone in her body shattered into fragments upon impact with the ground beneath her.
Li Xijun heard a faint, crisp sound in his mind, like a string snapping. The world around him remained the same yet felt utterly altered.
"Damn it!"
Guo Hongyao emerged from the maelstrom of thunder, her body wreathed in black smoke, teeth clenched in bitter fury.
Staring at Li Qinghong, she laughed through her anger.
"Good… good…"
