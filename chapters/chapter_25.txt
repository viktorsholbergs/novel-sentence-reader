“Fruit?” Li Xiangping looked up with confusion as he gazed at Li Qiuyang, who was seated cross-legged before him.
“Yes,” Li Qiuyang responded, his voice tinged with nervousness as he gripped the corner of his shirt tightly.
After several nights of cultivating, he had successfully condensed a strand of Embryonic Breathing’s spiritual qi, but he was worried. The speed of his progress did not seem to align with what the cultivation scripture suggested, making him fear he was straying off the correct path. Anxious, he decided to seek Li Xiangping’s guidance on the matter.
Hearing about Li Qiuyang’s unusually rapid cultivation, Li Xiangping was taken aback. He took time to thoroughly read through the Azure Essence Meridian Nourishment Technique, pondering deeply over its contents.
After a while, Li Xiangping looked up and asked Li Qiuyang if he had eaten anything unusual.
Li Qiuyang thought hard and then recalled a significant incident.
“A few years back, my friends and I dared each other to climb the mountain behind our village. I was the only one who actually went up. I got lost since I didn’t see my friends anywhere. While wandering, I stumbled upon a small tree with a turquoise hue, bearing six or seven reddish fruits. They were so bright and tempting.”
“I picked one and ate it. The next thing I knew, I was walking down the mountain in a daze and then slept for three days straight. My father was so worried, he called many physicians to check on me.”
Li Xiangping listened intently to Li Qiuyang’s story, momentarily lost for words. He then patted Li Qiuyang on the shoulder and said, “It seems that with this unexpected help, you might be able to condense the Profound Scenery Chakra within a year.”
Li Qiuyang’s face lit up with hope at these words. Li Xiangping, seeing his reaction, added, “But there’s something important we need to do first.”
Li Qiuyang looked up at him, his expression turning serious.
“We need to go up that mountain and search for that spirit root,” Li Xiangping declared.
Li Tongya returned to the small courtyard in Lijing Village. As he crossed the stone threshold at the entrance, he noticed Liu Rouxuan sitting quietly in the courtyard.
She was idly counting the fruit saplings in the spirit field with a blank look on her face.
Upon seeing Li Tongya enter, Liu Rouxuan quickly stood up from the stone bench and shyly greeted, “Immortal Master.”
“There’s no need for such formality,” Li Tongya replied, waving his hand dismissively.
He glanced at Liu Rouxuan’s beautiful face and smiled. “I’m only six or seven years older than you. Just call me Tongya.”
Liu Rouxuan seemed to relax at his approachable demeanor. She thought for a moment before saying, “All right, Brother Tongya.”
Li Tongya nodded in approval, then retrieved a wooden slip from a shelf in the room.
He handed it to Liu Rouxuan, explaining, “This is an Embryonic Breathing technique, the Azure Essence Meridian Nourishment Technique. Memorize it here in the courtyard, but remember, it's crucial not to share it with others.”
“Yes!” Liu Rouxuan replied, her voice tinged with pleasant surprise. She took the wooden slip respectfully, holding it carefully in her arms.
“Meals will be brought to you every day at the dragon hour and the snake hour[1]. If you need anything else, you can speak to the person who delivers your meals,” Li Tongya informed her as he poured two cups of tea.
“I’m not usually around in this courtyard on weekdays, but I’ll be here during those hours to cast spirit rain on the spirit field. If you have any questions about your cultivation, don’t hesitate to ask,” he added.
Liu Rouxuan nodded eagerly, absorbing every word. Li Tongya then inquired softly with a smile, “Have you received your clothes and daily necessities?”
“Yes,” Liu Rouxuan confirmed.
“Good. You can settle into the East house. Be diligent in your cultivation and don’t venture out until you’ve condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra. By the way, can you read?” Li Tongya suddenly asked.
“I studied when I was young, so I can read a little,” Liu Rouxuan replied.
“Good. Then, you can go through the scripture on your own, and if you have any questions, come and ask me,” Li Tongya instructed.
Liu Rouxuan acknowledged his instruction and then began reading each word and sentence on the wooden slip.
Watching Liu Rouxuan engrossed in the Azure Essence Meridian Nourishment Technique, Li Tongya sipped his tea, mulling over his thoughts.
This child is new to Lijing Village and is confined to this courtyard. I probably don’t have to worry about her leaking the cultivation method for the next few years.
It was at this moment that his thoughts were interrupted by a peal of laughter and the sound of the courtyard door being pushed open.
“What brings you here, Brother Xiangping?” Li Tongya asked in surprise, but then noticed Li Qiuyang timidly trailing behind Li Xiangping.
Upon hearing about the discovery of spirit root from Li Xiangping, Li Tongya was astounded but reminded himself to keep a watchful eye on Li Qiuyang.
Together, he and Li Xiangping decided to take Li Yesheng and several strong villagers up the mountain to investigate further.
As late autumn set in, the mountain’s secluded areas were blanketed with fallen leaves. The wild animals here were fattening themselves up for hibernation.
The people of Lijing Village, blessed with lush and abundant reeds, found little need to venture into the more dangerous parts of the mountains. The reeds provided ample sustenance, feeding the fish and livestock, making it unnecessary to risk confrontations with wild beasts in the mountains for food.
For their basic needs, the villagers depended on the forests at the foot of the mountain. They harvested firewood there or used readily available wood like the branches of evergreen shrubs or snow roses for cooking. The shrubs grew fast and their branches were easy to collect, so they were the preferred choice for firewood.
The villagers would only go up to the mountain to cut down the wood if they needed to build houses.
The mountain paths, rarely trodden, were overgrown with thorns and vines. Li Qiuyang struggled to recall the way, so a few villagers led the way, clearing the path with their firewood knives, with Li Xiangping and Li Tongya trailing behind.
Li Xiangping, holding Li Qiuyang’s hand, turned to Li Tongya with a question, “Brother Tongya, I have some questions.”
“What is it?” Li Tongya asked.
Li Xiangping continued, “Si Yuanbai set a boundary for our family, and the land outside this boundary belonged to other families. Before the rise of our Li Family, those families could have easily sent a cultivator who has attained the Embryonic Breathing realm and we would have been powerless against them.”
“Yet, why hasn’t a single immortal cultivator come forward throughout the past two centuries our family has cultivated these fields? Is it possible they genuinely hold such disdain for mortals?”
Li Tongya, rubbing his chin thoughtfully, replied with a serious expression, “I’ve pondered over this as well. From what Si Yuanbai implied, this region lacked spiritual energy for centuries, leading to a scarcity of resources for immortal cultivation. That’s probably why no immortal cultivator wants to waste their time here.”
“Additionally, we’re near Mount Dali, a vast range riddled with demons and spirits. It’s far less hospitable than the comforts of the provincial cities.”
Li Xiangping nodded, his expression turning somber. He then spoke to Li Tongya in a hushed tone, “Brother, there’s another grimmer possibility.”
“While the Azure Pond Sect is formidable and controls a significant portion of Yue State, they occupy only a quarter of it. Aren’t there formidable enemies nearby? I fear that our Li Family is situated right at the edge of the Azure Pond Sect’s influence.”
“When two villages compete for water, naturally, no one wants to cultivate near the disputed area. According to Xu Wenshan, to the south lies the Wu State. With continuous conflicts between Wu and Yue States, the relationship between their respective immortal sects is likely strained!”
Li Tongya’s heart sank, and his expression darkened. “We must investigate thoroughly. Tomorrow, I’ll send people to scout around the Guli Road. Understanding our family’s position is crucial.”
“I only hope that our Li Family isn’t merely a disposable asset, planted at the border by the Azure Pond Sect,” Li Xiangping added, mustering a bitter smile.
Their attention was then drawn by Li Yesheng and several villagers, drenched in sweat.
“Immortal Master! There’s a huge long worm here!” Li Yesheng shouted.
