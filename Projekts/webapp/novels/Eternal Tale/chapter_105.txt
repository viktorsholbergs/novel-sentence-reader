The incarnations of the big black ox continued to dissipate as they were beaten, gradually calming down from its anger. Chen Xun had said not to get carried away with enemies...
More and more cultivators joined the battle from all directions, with the big black ox blocking the frontlines while intercepting several waves of people sneaking up the mountain.
Sometimes, corpses fell from the sky, and sometimes there was nothing left but bones.
The commotion caused by Chen Xun's tribulation was too great...
All the pressure fell on its bovine shoulders. Hundreds of Foundation Establishment cultivators were in sight, seemingly enemies from all directions, leaving it feeling helpless.
The big black ox's gaze turned icy as it continued to fight. The aura of death emanating from the black coffin became even denser as the thunder in the sky intensified.
The surrounding cultivators felt a tingling sensation on their scalps and began to feel hesitant. This creature was simply not something Foundation Establishment cultivators could deal with; their protective barriers couldn't withstand it!
Roar!!
The big black ox roared again, and clusters of large fireballs slowly converged, seemingly appearing out of thin air.
The scorching aura filled the air as fiery flames enveloped the sky, brewing a fierce power. Suddenly, hundreds of cultivators felt a strong sense of danger, realizing they couldn't confront this spell head-on!
Just as the big black ox was about to roar out, a cold snort sounded from below, and a giant palm formed from spiritual energy came crashing down towards it!
With a flash of insight, it swiftly moved forward, instantly suppressing the fireball technique, and transforming it into a shadow.
The giant palm struck empty air, shattering the incarnation into pieces. Even the big black ox's protective barrier trembled, emitting a faint cracking sound.
A cultivator in the early Gold Core stage!
From Kaiyang Prefecture, Elder Meng Hong of the Red Sun Sect.
Several people instantly recognized him, and everyone respectfully bowed their heads. "Greetings, Elder."
This was the advantage of having strength and background; it was not something lone wolves like Chen Xun and the big black ox could compare with.
Meng Hong's expression was cold, his gaze sweeping over the big black ox's fierce outfit and its black coffin, a hint of interest in his eyes. "Stop it, and I'll be back in no time."
"Yes, Elder..." Everyone had no choice but to bow respectfully. Someone had probably already reported it to the sect.
Meng Hong looked towards the sky where the thunder gathered, his eyes filled with solemnity. What kind of treasure could cause such prolonged phenomena? And there was even a guardian monster. He became increasingly curious.
With each step, he walked into the void, fortunate that the Red Sun Sect was close to the border of the two provinces; otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to make it in time.
"Moo!!!" The big black ox let out a furious roar, about to soar into the sky to intercept the person. However, it suddenly froze in place, its bovine ears twitching.
The surrounding cultivators, feeling a great threat, only needed to hold it back; there was no need to use their full strength to fight desperately.
It slowly raised its head to look towards the peak of the snowy mountain, its eyes filled with great joy!
"Evil creature, don't resist anymore. With Elder Meng here, where else can you escape?"
"Surrender now!"
"Friends, the things on this evil creature are also treasures. Don't let them go!"
Several people spoke with different intentions, knowing that they had no share in the treasures above, but they might as well get a share of what this monster had.
Suddenly, the entire worldâ€”the entire snowy wilderness, seemed to be drawn by something, and not a single sound could be heard.
All the onlookers, including those participating in the battle, were trembling with fear, swallowing hard in disbelief as they stared at the sky. The thunder clouds were gradually dispersing, but in an instant, the sky and earth were covered in heavy snowfall.
Rumble!
The peak of the snow mountain was undergoing a shocking change. Countless flakes of ice and snow were melting, accompanied by deafening rumblings.
Numerous fiery lights ignited in the sky, with clusters of fiery fireballs appearing slowly, reaching an exaggerated climax!
"Elder, forgive me!!!" Suddenly, a terrified scream rang out from the peak of the snow mountain, as if it were Meng Hong, the senior cultivator who had just been dominated by a super-sized fireball.
A meteor-like super-sized fireball fiercely smashed into Meng Hong. With a whoosh, he was forcibly pressed from mid-air to the ground!
His face was twisted in pain, and blood was constantly spurting from his mouth. He had lived for more than half a century, yet now he was being single-handedly suppressed by someone!
His body seemed to be constantly melting, and that scorching aura seemed to be devouring his spiritual power.
Bang!
A huge roar echoed across the snowy wilderness as a violent surge of power gradually grew larger, erupting suddenly within the radius of the fireball crater!
The entire earth shook, stirring up boundless winds and snow, smashing a huge crater into the ground, with traces of melting everywhere.
Meng Hong had been burned to ashes, dead beyond death. A Gold Core cultivator was unexpectedly killed in one move!
Countless cultivators were dumbfounded, their mouths agape, utterly shocked, and speechless. What was happening?!
Their trembling and awestruck gazes slowly turned towards the peak of the snowy mountain, where a figure in black robes was coldly overlooking everyone.
Everyone's eyes converged on him, filled with unprecedented shock and awe!
"Moo~~" The big black ox was excited, tears swirling in its eyes as it quickly flew away on its sword.
On the peak of the snow mountain, Chen Xun's eyes showed a rare ferocity. He had seen everything and heard everything.
"Moo~~ Moo!!" The big black ox kept calling out excitedly, rubbing against Chen Xun forcefully.
"Old ox, I'm fine." Chen Xun showed a warm smile, but his eyes were colder than the snowstorms of the world.
He had the Scale of Reversal; touching it meant death. Even if he had to slaughter everyone in the world! Destroy everything! He wouldn't hesitate...
"Old ox, follow behind me." Chen Xun spoke softly, the ferocity in his eyes growing stronger.
"Moo~" The big black ox put away the black coffin and nodded heavily.
Hum!
Above the sky, Chen Xun rose into the air, each step causing a tremendous tremor. The big black ox followed behind him on its sword, looking down at the stunned cultivators below.
"Fireball Technique..." Chen Xun said indifferently, raising his hand towards the sky. Five inexplicable streams of power surged from his body, terrifying yet with a hint of divinity.
His eyes were ferocious yet indifferent as he looked down at all the cultivators below.
A sense of dread crept into the big black ox's heart. Chen Xun was truly angry.
Giant fiery red discs appeared one after another, and meteor-like fireballs spread out, releasing a scorching aura, as if descending from the heavens!
The sky above Chen Xun had completely turned fiery red, filled with raging spiritual power, resonating with a deep rumbling.
"What... does this mean?"
"We're done for..."
"He wants to kill all of us!!"
"Run!!!"
Countless cries of shock erupted; their eyes filled with intense fear. With their spiritual power raging, they summoned various magical tools and spells, desperately trying to flee!
But Foundation Establishment cultivators were so powerless in front of Golden Core cultivators. With a vigorous wave of his hand, Chen Xun sent countless meteorite fireballs crashing down from the sky!
Boom!
Boom!
One after another, fiercely blazing meteorite fireballs fell from the sky, countless screams echoing from the ground.
Their bodies were evaporated of blood, leaving nothing behind.
"Old ox, as long as I'm here."
"Moo moo~~"
The two black figures disappeared into the sky, leaving countless onlookers with dilated pupils, their mouths trembling.
These cultivators fell to their knees in powerlessness. Who exactly was that terrifying cultivator...
After they left, the snow peak had completely melted away. The map of the Qian Nation would have one less snowy peak.
In the far distance, Senior Brother Hu drew a cold breath. It wasn't a treasure causing the phenomenon; the snow peak had been directly melted away by a spell!
Cold sweat covered his forehead; it was right not to go.
This incident caused quite a stir, becoming increasingly mysterious as it spread. Nobody knew what they looked like or where they came from.
Especially the observing cultivators, they kept silent about the matter, not daring to casually discuss such terrifying figures, wisely protecting themselves.
The people of the Red Sun Sect in Kaiyang Province were dumbfounded. Half a day later, their Grand Elder had been burned to ashes.
They didn't dare to investigate this matter casually, only silently swallowing their losses to avoid bringing about a catastrophe for their sect...
That terrifying figure gradually became a legend here.
