Li Yuanjiao glanced over the letter, his expression relaxing as a slight smile appeared at the corners of his mouth. Tucking the letter into his robe, he didn't say much, but turned to Zong Yan and asked in a quiet tone, "How have the island's finances been over the past few years?"
"After covering expenses, we have a surplus of only two spirit stones… as for construction, formations, and rewards… those cost even more…" Zong Yan took out the records, looking a bit embarrassed. Located in such a remote area, Zongquan Island had little income in recent years, though the population had grown. If they counted the costs of formations and spirit paddies, the island had actually operated at a loss.
The Li Family hadn't expected any major returns from this outpost in the Eastern Sea, simply wanting a foothold there. Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly and replied, "No matter."
As they were talking, the dark clouds outside the island parted, and a variety of fish and turtles swam through the open space. A creature with a fish's face and bird-like wings descended outside the formation and called out, "Humans below, open the formation at once."
"It is Huiyao," Zong Yan said with some tension.
Li Yuanjiao waved a hand and replied, "Let him in."
With that, he returned to the main hall and took his seat. Before long, Huiyao entered—a creature resembling a black carp. Huiyao had once accepted both bribes and threats from the Li Family to conceal certain offerings.
Now, Huiyao had transformed his form, appearing with a fish face, a human body, and scaled wings beneath his arms. As soon as he entered, he announced, "Li Yuanjiao! So you have finally come out of seclusion! Something big has happened!"
Having read the letter Li Qinghong sent, Li Yuanjiao had a general understanding of the situation. Sipping his tea, he asked, "Oh? Does the Dragon Son of the Zhunan Water Palace have kinship with that fallen demon king?"
Huiyao paused, realizing that this person had his own background. Rubbing his hands together, he shook his head. "Not kin, exactly. Our faction never saw eye to eye with the demon king's. You have stayed in this remote place for so long, and now you finally have a chance to return."
Li Yuanjiao wasn't particularly interested in the internal politics of the dragon clan. Frowning, he asked, "Are you saying… this situation will affect us here? You are planning to return with the Dragon Son?"
Huiyao shook his head, a trace of envy flashing across his face. "I have not even reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, where would I get that kind of good fortune? I am just accompanying a few higher-ups from the palace back. When we leave… there may well be a new master appointed here."
Li Yuanjiao gave a slight nod. Huiyao then lowered his voice and continued, "But for now, with no one governing the seas, it is a prime opportunity for us to expand… I hope you could lend a hand…"
He added in a fawning tone, "If we gain higher status within the palace… it will be easier to help our allies, will it not?"
Li Yuanjiao understood immediately, but he had no desire to be used as a pawn by this demon. Shaking his head, he sighed, "I have an assignment at the moment, so I fear I will not be able to assist."
Huiyao added, "Oh, there is still plenty of time… It is only a rumor for now. When the time comes, all you need to do is join forces with me to kill a few demons, and that will be the end of it… My Hui clan… will certainly offer generous thanks."
Li Yuanjiao glanced at him, nodding noncommittally as he thought, When the family needs talisman qi, perhaps it will be worth considering.
Pleased, Huiyao took his leave, riding the wind in high spirits. Li Yuanjiao then turned to Kongheng. "Master Monk, could I trouble you to guard the island for a few days? I need to travel outside."
He planned to visit Splitreed Island but didn't give specific details. With arrangements made, he stepped off the island and flew northward on the wind.
Converging Sea.
When Li Xuanfeng spoke, Zhong Qian's face lit up with joy, and he nodded, bowing deeply. The initial shock he felt gradually eased, replaced by a sense of confusion, "Could it be that even the Devil Gate has such righteous individuals? Not only does he not want my precious herbs, but he also does not ask for compensation! And he is going to slay that demon…"
Having grown up in the Eastern Sea, Zhong Qian was naturally wary, always prepared to humble himself or bow if needed, but rarely trusting anyone as truly honorable. He thought to himself, But this man's aura is overwhelming, and he doesn't seem to mean me any harm. I'll just have to wait and see what he does… as long as he doesn't catch me off guard… I still have a chance to escape with this ancient talisman in my hand."
While he pondered, Li Xuanfeng finally spoke, his voice calm, "Come with me. Let us go meet them."
"Yes!" Zhong Qian had no choice but to obey. As he exited the formation and looked up, he saw that the dark clouds overhead were spreading out unimpeded, and he couldn't help but exclaim in alarm, "Senior, the island's protective formation is not active. That demon can sense my aura—it is likely already on its way."
"That is exactly what I want." Li Xuanfeng replied casually, stepping down the stone stairs.
Yuan Huo'e and several others waited respectfully at the foot of the mountain. Seeing the additional figure behind Li Xuanfeng, they dared not ask questions and instead greeted him in low voices, "Greetings, Daoist."
Zhong Qian noticed the respectful expressions on the faces of the market's attendants and realized that the man beside him was not only powerful but also held a high reputation within Azure Pond, with a prestigious status. He silently wondered, Could he be from the Chi Family?
Before he could think further, Li Xuanfeng approached the attendants, shook his head, and said, "This demon is coming for him. When the fighting begins, protect him."
Yuan Huo'e didn't fully understand, but as Li Xuanfeng had come on the Daoist Master's orders, there was undoubtedly a reason. He didn't dare question it, only nodding and respectfully replying, "Understood!"
Li Xuanfeng then looked back at Zhong Qian and said quietly, "This demon must hate you deeply. Stay with these men, and do not leave the formation."
Hearing this, Zhong Qian finally believed him. There was no way Li Xuanfeng would go to such lengths just to play games with him. Cupping his fist, he said, "May I know Senior's name?"
"I am Li Xuanfeng, under Daoist Master Yuan Su." As soon as he finished speaking, a massive wave surged in the distance, moving closer with the sound of thunderous roars.
Li Xuanfeng looked toward it, standing with his hands behind his back, and remarked pointedly, "The domain of Azure Pond is vast; it is not like the Eastern Sea where one claims land by occupying islands. The structure differs greatly from that of the Eastern Sea—there are distinctions between family clans, immortal peaks, and Daoist Masters that should not be generalized."
Zhong Qian responded thoughtfully, "It sounds similar to the Dragon Palace's structure… I am enlightened, Senior."
Rain began to fall in a light drizzle. Nearby, Yuan Huo'e appeared increasingly uneasy. This water ape was a late Foundation Establishment Realm demon, and if Li Xuanfeng struggled or, worse, perished here, it would spell disaster for him.
The pressure from Yuan Su, the Ning Family, and the Li Family was no small matter. After a moment's hesitation, he finally steeled himself and sent a message through a secret technique, "Daoist… this demon is no small threat… Why not return what it seeks, make peace with both sides, and let the matter pass?"
Li Xuanfeng shook his head. He appreciated Yuan Huo'e's cautious suggestion, as the two clans had some rapport, and he replied kindly through the same secret technique, "The Daoist Master sent me to eliminate this demon."
Yuan Huo'e immediately understood, nodding as he retreated and respectfully saying, "If the Daoist needs anything, a call will bring us to the fight."
