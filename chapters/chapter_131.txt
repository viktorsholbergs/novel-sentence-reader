Li Xuanfeng made sure Jiang Yunu settled down nicely and spent a few days with her in town, living an ordinary life. However, the day to pay tributes at Cloud Crowned Peak arrived, and he had to leave. He patted her head and took out a brocade pouch.
"I'm leaving behind these hundred taels of silver for you to use… hire a couple of reliable servants to live peacefully. I have important matters to attend to, I'll return to see you in either one or three months," he informed.
"All right…" Jiang Yunu obediently agreed, not daring to say more. Li Xuanfeng tied her sash and took a good look at her before speaking again.
"Wait for me."
He then eyed the sky for a while, his bow drawn but without an arrow. Suddenly releasing the bowstring, the courtyard was filled with the buzzing sound of the string.
After this empty shot, Li Xuanfeng waited a few moments. All of a sudden, he caught a wild goose that fell from the sky and handed it to Jiang Yunu, smiling.
"Try this wild goose! We have no formal agreement between us, so let this goose stand in for now. We'll make it official when possible!"
After demonstrating his remarkable skills, Li Xuanfeng carried his longbow and took to the skies, leaving a dazed Jiang Yunu standing in the courtyard alone.
She clutched the corner of her dress as if lost in a dream before slowly walking inside with the unconscious goose cradled in her arms.
After flying for a while, Li Xuanfeng landed at the foot of Cloud Crowned Peak and saw Xiao Ruyu sweeping the stone steps with a hat on his head and a broom in his hand. The seventeen-year-old's handsome appearance made even his desolate attire seem dignified.
"Brother Ruyu!" Li Xuanfeng greeted him with some surprise, asking, "What are you doing?"
Xiao Ruyu shook his head, looking somewhat embarrassed.
"Ah… Brother Xuanfeng might not know, but my Xiao Family has a peculiar rule… Every time we submit our tributes, I, as the young family head, have to sweep here at the foot of Cloud Crowned Peak. If we encounter disciples from other families, I have to ask for a lesson or two… they're usually willing to give face and spar," he explained sheepishly.
Li Xuanfeng suddenly understood, pondering to himself quietly.
The Xiao Family has its ways. Now, the strengths and weaknesses of all families are known to them, and they still have to accept it… Is it even possible for them to skip paying their tributes at Cloud Crowned Peak? Given the Xiao Family's influence, once others have arrived, how could anyone refuse their challenge to spar..?
After glancing at Xiao Ruyu, Li Xuanfeng smiled.
"Brother Ruyu, do you wish to test my skills?"
"Not at all, it's just a friendly sparring!" Xiao Ruyu quickly shook his head.
He hesitated for a moment before continuing, "However... Brother Li's use of archery for such close combat might be considered somewhat unfair. How about I move back one li, and then we spar?"
"No need!" Li Xuanfeng laughed. He had not gone all out since attaining the Qi Cultivation Realm and was itching for a real challenge. Holding his tall bow horizontally, he drew the string without needing an arrow.
Right away, a sharp golden Astral Qi burst forth from the string, aimed directly at Xiao Ruyu.
Xiao Ruyu lifted his broom slightly, his pale protective true essence surrounding him. However, he still felt a twinge of pain in his forehead, immediately sensing impending danger. Shocked, he realized he had underestimated Li Xuanfeng.
I've made a mistake! This man's skill in controlling the bowstring is not something ordinary cultivators can match… I should have closed the distance before he drew his bow. I was too arrogant!
In the midst of these thoughts, Xiao Ruyu had already taken several steps forward while he was distracted. Li Xuanfeng released the bowstring, and golden qi burst forth. Taking two steps back, he then condensed another wave of qi.
Xiao Ruyu wrapped his broom with true essence, not daring to be distracted for even a moment, well aware that any hit from the Astral Qi would bore a hole right through him.
He faced the incoming golden qi head-on and shattered it, quickly turning around to shatter another—confronting several waves of qi in quick succession. As he drew closer to Li Xuanfeng, he felt as if a biting cold wind was hitting him in the face, making his movements increasingly slower.
"What's happening...?" Xiao Ruyu was alarmed and frantically scanned his surroundings with his spiritual sense only to discover, much to his dismay, that the shattered qi only turned into golden streams that gnawed away at his protective true essence.
Xiao Ruyu had practiced his family's techniques which made him significantly faster than Li Xuanfeng. However, he gradually slowed down, watching as Li Xuanfeng, using the recoil force, quickly increased the distance between them.
Left with no other choice, Xiao Ruyu performed hand seals to cast several spells aimed at countering Li Xuanfeng in an attempt to disrupt him.
He did not expect Li Xuanfeng to shatter those spells almost effortlessly with a sweep of his pitch-black longbow, then halted and simply waved his hand, saying, "Brother Xiao's cultivation is certainly impressive… Let's stop here!"
Xiao Ruyu gave him a deep look, pondered for a while, and then dispelled his true essence. He cupped his fist and said with a smile, "Please go ahead, Brother Xuanfeng."
Li Xuanfeng nodded in farewell, lost in his own thoughts.
In a life-and-death battle, if I am five miles away from him, he is sure to die; at a distance of one mile, the outcome is uncertain. If we were to face each other head-on, I fear I might not be his match.
Although Li Xuanfeng had the upper hand earlier, continuously shooting arrows had already exhausted him physically and mentally.
Deciding to call it quits was probably for the best.
On the other side, Xiao Ruyu watched Li Xuanfeng ascend the mountain, feeling a secret sense of alarm. He realized then that Li Xuanfeng was not easy to deal with.
Meanwhile, a young man approached from below, prompting Xiao Ruyu to ask, "Who might you be?"
"Lu Yuanlu from the Lu Family! Who are you blocking my way?!" the young man shouted in response.
Xiao Ruyu stared at the arrogant young man before him, momentarily dumbfounded, wearing an odd expression.
Upon reaching the mountaintop, Li Xuanfeng saw a small courtyard. Not recognizing anyone, he decided to sit in a corner and observe.
Noticing a man with a bruised face approaching, he curiously wondered to himself, What feud does this man have with Xiao Ruyu to end up in such a state?
After a while, a Dawn Cloudliner crossed the sea of clouds and slowly descended atop the mountain. A middle-aged man in Daoist robes, at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm and wearing a jade crown and exuding a dignified aura, stepped down.
The middle-aged man first paid respects to Xiao Chuting and then sat down to meditate.
As the servants of the immortal sect began calling names one by one, Li Xuanfeng waited patiently. When it was finally the Li Family of Lijing's turn, he stepped forward to submit the tributes.
The jade-crowned middle-aged man's ears twitched. He opened his eyes and politely nodded at Li Xuanfeng, saying, "The great name of Lijing's Li Family is well-known; a Qi Cultivator of just fifteen is indeed rare within the sect!"
Li Xuanfeng was taken aback, unsure of when his family's reputation had spread within the sect. He quickly regained his composure and cupped his fist respectfully.
"You're flattering me, Senior! I am merely fortunate… To think that tales of our small family from a remote region has somehow reached your ears is truly humbling!"
The middle-aged man shook his head and laughed, interrupting the roll call to chat with him.
"The esteemed Qingsui Sword Immortal, Li Chejing of your family recently broke through to Foundation Establishment Realm in Yi Mountain City, defeating Chi Zhiyun the Flaming Phoenix Sword with a stroke of Celestial Moon Slash technique. His swordsmanship is unparalleled, making the Li Family's name known all throughout the sect!"
Upon hearing this, the entire assembly was astonished.
Li Xuanfeng was visibly delighted. Being young and born after Li Chejing had already returned to the sect, he had no memory of this fourth uncle's appearance. Nonetheless, he was extremely surprised and proud at that very moment for the recognition, offering his thanks repeatedly.
Xiao Chuting opened his eyes slightly, knowing the significance of the sword immortal more than anyone present.
He thought to himself, The Qingsui Sword Immortal, Li Chejing, has truly grasped sword intent. Such a prodigy! I have heard from Yuansi about his exceptional talent… but I could never imagine that it was to this extent!
However, he sighed softly, falling victim to his own thoughts once more.
What a pity for him to fall into the hands of the Azure Chi Devil Gate having cultivated such a miraculous foundation… How could there be a good end for him? Sooner or later, he's bound to become sustenance for that old demon. Such a pity indeed...
The middle-aged man grew visibly more excited as he spoke, saying, "We swordsmen also thought of visiting the immortal in the southern border to seek guidance but learned he was sent deep into the south by the sect to search for elixir and haven't returned for decades… We had no choice but to return empty-handed!"
Regretfully sighing, he looked warmly at Li Xuanfeng.
"Before I left the sect, I checked the registry… and your family was still listed among the minor families of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. It's clear these officials are not diligent! Since you have also attained the Qi Cultivation Realm, why not change it here?"
As soon as Li Xuanfeng agreed, the middle-aged man took out a brush and ink right away, unexpectedly doing the work himself.
He crossed out the old entry in the jade registry and upgraded it to a major family, lamenting, "If only the sect rules did not specify that only sect disciples who have attained the Foundation Establishment Realm could be listed as a clan, this correction would have been most convenient!"
After receiving new spirit seeds and stipend requests, Li Xuanfeng chatted briefly with the middle-aged man before excusing himself politely.
The interrupted roll call ceremony then continued, and he stood proudly at the forefront, enjoying the surprised and envious glances around him. His admiration toward his fourth uncle soared, imagining him as an elegant sword immortal in his head.
"Once I reach Foundation Establishment Realm, I must spar with Fourth Uncle to see if my bow or his sword is faster!"
