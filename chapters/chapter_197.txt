"Emperor's Mandate..."
The ancient and imposing name took both Li Yuanxiu and Li Tongya by surprise.
While Li Yuanxiu was less affected, Li Tongya, who had encountered numerous immortal foundations throughout his life, was stunned to hear of one named after an emperor for the first time. He pondered deeply to himself.
The immortal foundation formed from the River One Qi Technique is called Boundless Ocean, and the one from Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique is Spring's Echo... The immortal foundation is always closely related to the method of cultivation; Jianixi's technique must also have been equally powerful!
Li Yuanxiu, who was standing beside him, displayed a look of yearning as he listened to the name of the immortal foundation. His ears pricked up instantly, and he felt an uncontrollable desire rising within him.
To cultivate an immortal foundation and to traverse the mysterious realm… the allure of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm is so tempting! I wonder if in this lifetime I might glimpse the realm beyond Qi Cultivation…
The Li Family's main lineage had already produced three Qi Cultivators, and Li Xuanling was just a step away. The expectations for Li Yuanxiu and his younger relatives were primarily set beyond the Qi Cultivation Realm, hence instigating such thoughts in Li Yuanxiu.
Li Tongya inquired further about the details from Li Feiruo, who patiently answered each of his questions.
Mu Jiaoman had been cautious of Li Feiruo during his lifetime and hadn't said much, so no further useful information was obtained.
"I see," Li Tongya said before smiling warmly to Li Yuanxiu, thus ending the prior topic of conversation.
"We have mobilized a great number of people for this, and many eyes are upon us... We risk becoming targets, so it's not advisable to stay away from home for long. I'll remain here for a month while several elders will stay in the city to watch over things. Go sort out the affairs of the Mount Yue territory with your father. Once that's done, we'll return home together."
"As for Feiruo…" Li Tongya's voice trailed off as he glanced at her, and Li Feiruo quickly expressed her wishes.
Li Tongya nodded in understanding and commended her once more.
"You've worked hard these years. Help Xiu'er handle the affairs and then return to Lijing Town to live a peaceful life."
"Yes!" Li Yuanxiu and Li Feiruo both responded respectfully. Li Tongya then nodded, his figure fading as he rode the wind away… of course, taking the brown eyeball with him.
Left behind, Li Yuanxiu and Li Feiruo exchanged a glance with each other in the courtyard.
Li Feiruo made a welcoming gesture, and Li Yuanxiu took his seat at the head of the table.
"Please enlighten me, Auntie," he said warmly.
"My pleasure…" Li Feiruo smiled as she nodded gently, speaking softly.
"Currently, Eastern Mount Yue has a population of 226,000, with 11 towns and 63 villages. There are 62 Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators and 8 Qi Cultivators—all harnessing unrefined qi. They're not very useful in major capacities, but adequate for cultivating spirit fields. The Eastern Mount Yue consists of six major noble clans, with the Mulu Clan as their leader. Most of the cultivators come from these clans, which hold ninety percent of the treasures and spirit items. Mount Yue is not skilled in agriculture, however… most of the spirit fields lie fallow."
Li Yuanxiu nodded and said in a low voice, "The land of Mount Yue is much more fertile than that of our Li Family. It's approximately the same size in area but with a much larger population. People in Mount Yue live by hunting in the mountains and gathering crops, and although they practice agriculture, they are not adept at it. Once we educate them, they could support an additional hundred thousand people."
"The matter of the spirit fields has already been attended to by my father, who has sent people to investigate. We should have a clear understanding of it in a few days," Li Yuanxiu paused after saying this, noticing that Li Feiruo had something to say. He stopped to look expectantly at her.
"That's right, Young Family Head, but what about these spirit items currently in the hands of the clans? How do you plan to handle them?" Li Feiruo asked quietly.
She had managed to execute the high shaman with the help of these clans, and now that she was about to leave the court and return to Lijing Town, she did not hesitate to propose such an idea.
"These people are cunning; if we don't kill a few, they won't obey…" she added as she glanced downward.
"Indeed."
Li Yuanxiu pressed his hands on the table and continued, "I'll ask Clan Uncle Qiuyang and Uncle Donghe to take our clan soldiers and search house by house. With their spiritual sense, these people will have nowhere to hide. We'll find an excuse to detain their young and exchange them for spirit items."
Li Yuanxiu paused briefly, then sighed. When he opened his mouth to speak again, his voice was heavy with emotion.
"I didn't want to use such crude methods, but with only a month's time, we cannot afford to wear them down slowly. We must resort to violence… and deter them through fear of slaughter."
Shamoli flew over the eleven towns below, strategically placing his troops in each one. His spirits, previously dampened by Qimu's nonsensical words, had improved considerably.
After making a complete circuit with the four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators following him, they finally descended upon Mulu Town.
"Years have passed since I left in destitution, and now I return in fine clothing..."
Shamoli sighed, attempting to articulate his feelings with the limited literary flair he had picked up from the Easterners. Running out of eloquent expressions, he naturally stumbled over his words.
He suddenly turned his head, and with considerable disdain, looked at the attire of the few Mount Yue Qi Cultivators behind him and commanded, "You lot! Tie up your hair, and what are these ragged clothes you're wearing?!"
The group of Mount Yue Qi Cultivators was stunned and clearly dumbfounded.
"R…Ragged?" they sputtered, repeating his words in disbelief.
Shamoli sighed softly before grabbing the hand of the one in front. He patted his shoulder and explained, "You have spent your lives in this dirt hole… and never had the chance to witness the prosperity beyond our borders. Give it another two years, and you'll understand the difference between good and bad."
They had landed in the town center as they were in conversation, only to see clan soldiers bustling about, armed and rushing in formation through the streets.
Their cold armor clinked sharply; however, they were not heading toward the houses of the rich or common folk but specifically targeting large estates led by either Embryonic Breathing Realm or Qi Cultivators, marching up the stone steps.
Angry shouts then followed as the clan soldiers silently dragged out the obese bodies of the people along.
The Mount Yue clans were not as regulated as those ruled by the Li Family, and each of them was as fat as a pig due to the lack of productive work, and they were screaming as they were dragged out.
It took two soldiers to haul each one, and one even yelled, "Do you know who I am?! My uncle is a Qi Cultivator!"
A soldier promptly kicked him, causing him such pain that he rolled around, unable to speak.
The leader, a third stage Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator, stood expressionless as he pointed his long sword at the man.
Shamoli, witnessing this, felt his expression change and his unease grow. He stopped a troop of clan soldiers, demanding in a stern voice, "What are you all doing?!"
The leader, looking serious yet honest, still holding his long sword, replied cautiously, "Xu Gongming greets the Great King… We are acting on orders from Young Master Jiao to arrest those among the six major clans who are conspiring with Qimu's remnants. What about you, Great King..?"
"Ah."
Realizing they were searching for Qimu's remnants, Shamoli's expression shifted to one that was between shock and joy.
He then looked fiercely at those clan members and exclaimed, "Good! Brother Jiao is indeed thorough! Go ahead and do what you need to; I have your back!"
With that, he turned to stare coldly at the four Mount Yue Qi Cultivators that were behind him. They were indeed from the six major clans, all of whom bowed their heads guiltily, not daring to meet his eyes.
"Well then, I shall execute my order!" Xu Gongming responded, still expressionless. He gave a signal, and the clan soldiers immediately sprang into action.
