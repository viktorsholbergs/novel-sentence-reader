The March to the Forbidden Grounds
* * *
The next day.
The weather is, as usual, foggy.
This place is always foggy.
It rarely even rains, let alone clears up.
And through the bottom of this Eserem Sea of Fog, a countless horde of Kobudai, with red and blue body colors, was swimming straight westward.
The Red and Blue Kobudai Allied Forces!
Their destination, kicking aside and scattering any sharks that jumped out at them along the way, as they advanced at breakneck speed, is the forbidden grounds… where the Calamity is sealed… in the valley at the back of the Black Kobu Tribe village.
<<<We’ll crush the Black Kobu!>>>
<<<We’ll even twist the Calamity!>>>
<<<We’ll become heroes!>>>
The morale of the Red Kobu Tribe is high.
They’re all excited, their hunting instincts heightened, their fighting spirit burning, their eyes gleaming.
They’re warriors to the core.
They’ve been taught to be so, since the time they were fry.
<<<…>>>
On the other hand, the Blue Kobu Tribe is quiet.
Calmly, without any idle chatter…
…They continued their march, like machines.
But there’s definitely a fire burning in their eyes.
Though their ways are different, they are also warriors.
<<<My, my, not a single battle so far…>>>
Now then, at the rear of that horde…
The young Red Kobu Clan Chief, Kobdalian, clicked his tongue, impressed.
Yes… this Red and Blue Kobudai Allied Force, despite being a rather large group, hasn’t been spotted by the Black Kobu Tribe, and hasn’t encountered any battles.
<<<As expected of ‘Kobdacleva, the Wise’s’ strategy. I’m impressed.>>>
<<<I’m honored to receive your praise.>>>
This is all thanks to the strategy of Kobdacleva, the Clan Chief of the Blue Kobu Tribe, swimming beside Kobdalian.
Kobdacleva’s strategy, in a word, is a diversionary tactic.
A separate unit of Red Kobu warriors engages the Black Kobu Tribe in battle at a location far from the main force’s current route.
While the Black Kobu Tribe’s attention is focused there, the main force tries to get as close as possible to the forbidden grounds.
It’s a simple strategy in words, but it seems that Kobdacleva is a master of Kobudai psychology.
By repeatedly creating diversions at the right place and time, it seems that the main force’s presence has been completely concealed from the Black Kobu Tribe.
<<<Well, it might be boring for the Red Kobu warriors, since there’s been no action.>>>
<<<They can take out their frustration in the battle at the forbidden grounds. I’m the one who decided to go along with your strategy. If any Red Kobu complain, I’ll beat them up.>>>
The two of them grinned and laughed.
They had that much composure.
Everything is going smoothly…
…Too smoothly…
<<<…>>>
Kobdaroze, swimming beside Kobdalian like a bodyguard, felt an unspeakable anxiety at this smooth progress.
He wondered if there would be a backlash somewhere…
It’s just a warrior’s intuition, with no basis, but it can’t be ignored.
Kobdaroze, alone, heightened his vigilance.
Just in case something happens…
* * *
<<<Alright! It’s time to refuel!!>>>
<<<Hey, you lot! There’s a battle coming up! Eat up, so you don’t collapse from hunger!>>>
<<<Yeah!!>>>
A few hours later.
The Allied Forces were taking a break at the bottom of a valley, near the Black Kobu Tribe’s territory.
This place is surrounded by high cliffs on both sides, making it hard to see.
In other words, it’s difficult for the Black Kobu Tribe to find them, and…
<<<Deliciousss!!>>>
<<<As expected, wild ones taste better!!>>>
…This valley also happens to be a turban shell habitat.
The Kobudai were all eagerly crushing and eating turban shells in this hidden spot that the Blue Kobu Tribe had discovered beforehand, healing their bodies, exhausted from the march.
<<<…You should rest while you can, Kobdaroze.>>>
Even here, Kobdaroze alone remained tense, ready for battle.
He continued to use 【Body Strengthening】, and a slight 【Intimidation】 was leaking out.
Kobdalian, finally unable to ignore it, spoke to him.
The time for the decisive battle is approaching.
Kobdaroze is an excellent warrior.
It wouldn’t be good if he wasn’t able to give it his all when it matters.
<<<Yeah…>>>
But Kobdaroze only gave a halfhearted reply.
Inside him, gradually, gradually… a sense of crisis was building.
His warrior’s intuition was sounding the alarm…
Blaring… blaring.
So loud that it made his head ache.
<<<Hey, Kobdaroze, you…>>>
However, Kobdalian couldn’t share that sense of crisis.
He’s strong.
Overwhelmingly strong for a Kobudai.
Therefore, in terms of vigilance and danger perception, he was inferior to the average Kobudai.
<<<!? …Tch! …They’re here!?>>>
<<<What? They’re here? Who…? >>>
Therefore.
Kobdalian only realized the unspeakable crisis that Kobdaroze was feeling after it actually happened.
ZUDONN!
First… a crashing sound echoed through the Allied Forces’ resting place.
And the source of that sound was behind the horde… near where Kobdalian and the others were resting.
<<<What was that!? >>>
Kobdalian hurriedly turned towards the sound.
The wind blew, thinning the fog that was enveloping the area, improving visibility.
And then, standing there was…
Perhaps it had fallen from a considerable height.
Slowly rising from the small crater at its feet.
It had two legs, two arms, black hair growing from its head, and black eyes.
Its rather slender, small body was covered in spiky, jet-black scales (that’s how the Kobudai perceived it), and from the gaps in those scales, a jet-black haze was occasionally emitted, like steam, contaminating the surrounding blue fog.
It was such a creature…
<<<There it is again… the monster!!>>>
Kobdaroze shouted, after shuddering!
The protagonist… has appeared!!
