Li Xijun and the others had been traveling through the mountains of the Quanwu range for several days now. With Kongheng leading the way, they had acquired a few spirit items and had encountered no Foundation Establishment Realm demons, and were merely wandering through the forest.
Li Xuanxuan and another cultivator were performing incantations and surveying the earth veins. After some time, they found a clue near a deep pool. Li Xijun then remarked, "Granduncle, according to the descriptions and techniques from the Chilling Snow Series, there should be a type of spirit water within this pool."
Li Xuanxuan, holding a bundle of mountain fruits, sorted through them and handed Li Xijun a plum before nodding slightly. After performing some calculations with a hand seal, he said quietly, "We may need to wait a few more days. The water vein runs deep, and it will not be easy to retrieve the spirit water quickly."
Li Xijun placed the fruit in his pouch and, along with Li Xuanxuan, continued casting spells, working together to draw out the spirit water. They alternated, one resting while the other maintained the spell. After about five or six days, a golden light finally appeared in the sky, descending rapidly.
When the golden light landed, it transformed into a man dressed in radiant feathered robes, holding a golden ring. His aura was overwhelming, indicating that he had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. The moment he landed, the pressure from his presence made the group feel as though their faces were being cut by sharp blades.
The man glanced at the surface of the pool, his face expressionless, and he was clearly here for the spirit water.
He held the golden ring in his hand and had a rather handsome face. His clothing—with golden hooks, rings, and diamond-patterned robe—immediately gave away his identity as a disciple of the Golden Tang Gate.
"Greetings, Senior…" The Li Family members greeted, cupping their fists.
The Golden Tang Gate cultivator looked down on them arrogantly, his expression showing a hint of excitement. After glancing at the three of them, he drawled, "Where are you three from? This spirit water now belongs to the Golden Tang Gate."
Li Xuanxuan and Li Xijun exchanged glances, while Kongheng frowned deeply and retorted, "But we were here first…"
Li Xijun quickly interrupted him and pulled him back, replying politely, "We are from the Li Family of Qingdu Peak. Since Senior desires it, we will leave this pool to you."
"No." The man's smile was cold and mocking as he said sharply, "You will retrieve the spirit water for me before you leave."
Li Xuanxuan studied the man's face, finding it vaguely familiar. Then, he suddenly recalled that they had crossed paths years ago when he had sought out Kong Yu to help move a mountain, only to encounter this same arrogant Golden Tang Gate disciple.
"Situ Mo!"
This man had a notoriously bad temper. He had mocked Kong Yu mercilessly at the time, making fun of him for being from a small, insignificant family. Li Xuanxuan had not known the full story until then. Back then, Situ Mo had been at the peak of Qi Cultivation Realm, but now, he had just entered the Foundation Establishment Realm.
This kind of person… is only relying on his family's connections!
Li Xuanxuan cursed inwardly. Situ Mo's face was full of contempt as he stared at Li Xuanxuan, with an expression betraying his intense dislike.
Li Xuanxuan quickly realized, Damn it! He recognizes me… I have been dragged into this because of the Kong Family… But what kind of grudge does he have against them for him to hate them this much?
Sure enough, when Li Xijun politely responded, Situ Mo only sneered and said in a low voice, "I remember your family… Years ago, my elders collected qi in your clan's territory! They lured a demon sparrow, causing quite a mess. Your ancestors were mortals back then, they probably even bowed before my elders back then."
Li Xijun had thought at first that this man was merely a spoiled and rich young master, but after hearing that remark, he immediately realized that this was an enemy. The polite smile disappeared from his face, now replaced by a cold expression.
Li Xuanxuan, though filled with anger, was even more perplexed.
Where does this young man's deep hatred come from? This must be about more than the Profound Peak Gate...
He truly could not understand where Situ Mo's deep hatred stemmed from, and the man's words were venomous and harsh, fueling the fire of Li Xuanxuan's anger. The elder's face had already darkened with displeasure.
Situ Mo coldly eyed Li Xuanxuan and spoke in a low voice, "That day we met in the wilderness—if I had known that you hideous old thing were from the Li Family, I would have killed you on the spot… you…"
He gritted his teeth and continued viciously, "The An Family and the Lu Family made deals with a tiger, and in the end, your Li Family wiped them out. It was indeed satisfying to watch! But because of your family's deeds, my mother fell into despair and took her own life… Now, I have waited long enough for this day, to make your family suffer as my mother did!"
Li Xijun stood frozen in shock, while Kongheng's eyes widened in disbelief. Li Xuanxuan's mind buzzed as one image after another flashed before him, finally settling on a face that had long worried Li Xiangping and Li Tongya…
"Ji Dengqi!" Li Xuanxuan blurted out, "You… you are the son of that Ji Family woman!"
"Haha! Exactly…"
Situ Mo had not even finished his sentence when Li Xijun, having already understood the situation, grabbed Kongheng's sleeve and, in a flash of red light, launched himself into the sky, fleeing at great speed. Even Situ Mo was briefly stunned before he roared in anger, "Just like Li Tongya's spawn! Crafty like a snake!"
Kongheng and Li Xuanxuan were still in shock, but as they realized what was happening, they prepared to follow. Just then, a golden light rose around the pool, sealing the area and trapping them inside.
Situ Mo sneered at Li Xijun's retreating figure and said, "Did you really think I was talking all this time for nothing?"
In the distance, Li Xijun, who was enveloped in red light, was just about to break through the formation when a golden weapon, lying in ambush, shot forward, piercing him straight through the chest and pinning him to the ground.
Blood splattered as the teenager fell to the earth with a heavy thud. The sight sent chills down Li Xuanxuan's spine. His mana-enhanced sight allowed him to see clearly as a bloodstained plum fruit rolled out of the boy's chest pocket, bouncing twice on the ground.
"The little one ran fast, but he fell to the Dinglin Piercer, and died a bit sooner!" A flash of pleasure crossed Situ Mo's face before he turned his attention to the two remaining men.
His voice was icy as he said, "You old fool, you may have some experience, but my mother was Ji Dengyu! The head of the Ji Family back then, Ji Dengqi, was my uncle! When Lu Sisi and An Zheyan slaughtered my Ji Family, they thought my father had been killed, but they did not know my mother was already carrying me in her womb…"
"I thought you would return the same way, but you kept twisting and turning, ending up in Mount Quanwu. I searched for so long, and now that I've found you, I won't let you all leave!"
His expression was cruel and ferocious, but there was a twisted joy in his voice, the kind that only comes from vengeance.
Laughing maniacally, he said coldly, "I know how ruthless the Li Family is, and Li Tongya was a Foundation Establishment Realm sword cultivator, so my mother never dared speak of this, raising me in secret… But now that I have established an immortal foundation, it is time to settle this grudge!"
Li Xuanxuan was in utter shock. His mind raced, his eyes reddening with anger as he tried to explain through gritted teeth, "The destruction of the Ji Family was due to the An and Lu families seizing the two mountains—it had nothing to do with my family!"
"Nothing to do with you?" Situ Mo sneered.
Since he was not in any hurry and felt certain of his victory, he could not resist arguing back. His voice filled with hatred as he said, "My Ji Family had planted someone close to Lu Yuanlu, and that loose-tongued fool was consumed with jealousy over Li Tongya! He revealed everything! Who do you think you are fooling?"
That idiot! It was that idiot all along!
Li Xuanxuan felt an icy chill sweep over him, making it hard to breathe. His chest burned with rage, and all he could think about was Li Xijun outside. The wound on his face began to crack, revealing a faint golden pill beneath.
Blood began to flow from his seven orifices, and the six old wounds on his body burst open, spraying blood everywhere. His eyes bulged, and he was rendered speechless.
Suddenly, a hand rested on his shoulder, emitting a soft, warm golden light that quickly calmed his emotions and slowly healed his wounds.
Kongheng, with a slight bow of his head, spoke gently, "Elder, you are still not recovered yet, please quell your anger. This humble monk is here… there is nothing for you to worry about."
