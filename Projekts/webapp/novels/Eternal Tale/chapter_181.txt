On the way to the cave mansion, Chen Xun and the big black ox were communicating through sound transmission.
"Old Ox, how are the formations in Snow Listening Valley?"
"Moo~" responded the big black ox.
"After some study, I'm confident we can handle it within a few breaths."
"Moo moo~"
"Got it."
Chen Xun smiled, and a few crystalline snowflakes slowly fell onto him from the sky.
His eyes gradually became deep and unfathomable, emitting a barely perceptible sharpness, like a serene green pool, as if nothing in the world could stir even the slightest ripple in his gaze.
The big black ox sneaked a glance at Chen Xun, a gleam of light appearing in its otherwise dull eyes, and its mouth slowly curved into a smile.
Jiang Xuechen was walking ahead. For some reason, her heart stirred, and she suddenly turned to look at Chen Xun and the big black ox.
They were still smiling brightly, occasionally playing around, appearing completely innocent and harmless...
"Honored seniors, this cave mansion was only recently established, and a spirit-gathering formation has already been set up, specifically prepared for you two." Jiang Xuechen's smile was somewhat stiff. She still believed in the augury from that night. "If you need any cultivation resources, I can assist."
"Good," Chen Xun nodded with a smile.
"Moo~" The big black ox happily kicked up its hind legs, sending a flurry of white snow into the air.
Jiang Xuechen then turned around and continued walking, though her heart grew increasingly uneasy. These two were definitely not as simple as they appeared.
After the time it takes to burn an incense stick.
**Rumble!**
Under the waterfall that seemed to descend from the heavens in Snow Listening Valley, Chen Xun and the big black ox stood stunned, their eyes slightly widened, marveling at the wonders of nature.
"Honored seniors, this is the place." Jiang Xuechen introduced with the utmost respect, not daring to be the least bit presumptuous, "Ahead is the location of the cave mansion. No one in Snow Listening Valley dares to disturb you here."
"Please thank Daoist Jin Yu on our behalf. We are very satisfied with this place."
"If the seniors have any instructions, just call out in front of the cave mansion, and I will come immediately."
"Good."
Chen Xun nodded calmly. His divine sense had already explored the cave mansion, finding it well-equipped and filled with an abundance of spiritual energy, the likes of which they had rarely encountered in their lives.
"Moo~" The big black ox snorted heavily, showing great interest in the spirit-gathering formation.
Jiang Xuechen bowed again and then disappeared from the spot. With a Nascent Soul ancestor in closed-door cultivation, potentially for centuries, she dared not linger.
"Old Ox, how do you find this environment?"
Chen Xun laughed heartily. They were surrounded by a dense forest, with heavy snow falling and covering everything in a uniform white.
The big black ox had already started running around joyfully, occasionally lifting its head to look at the flying waterfall above the forest, though a pile of snow now sat atop its head.
"Old Ox, you go and set up the formations in the cave mansion. I'll transplant some Crane Spirit Trees and think about our next steps."
Chen Xun's surroundings shimmered with a faint light, the wind and snow unable to touch him. He found a snowy patch to sit down on. "Having strength makes things much easier now."
"Moo?" The big black ox ran over and nudged Chen Xun, "Moo moo!"
"Go on," Chen Xun laughed, patting the big black ox.
With a loud bellow, the big black ox rushed towards the cave mansion. It still had many preparations to make, including surveying the surroundings.
Chen Xun lay down on the snow, looking up at the sky, lost in thought.
This fire technique was naturally useless to them; it was merely a cover. Forcing cultivation with incompatible spiritual roots would cause chaos and result in severe consequences.
What he originally anticipated was building connections and later seeking the five-element spiritual root techniques, ostensibly for research purposes.
But he hadn't expected that the great war in the cultivation world would provide them with many opportunities, even being treated as honored guests by a major faction.
In this cultivation world, if he said they had cultivated to the Nascent Soul stage with their five-element spiritual roots, the consequences would be unimaginable. It was likely that all the cultivators from the Northern War would come rushing back.
And if he added, "Hehe, isn't this a supreme opportunity right here? Why fight anymore?! Fellow Daoists, seize it!"
"Sigh, the cultivation world." Chen Xun shook his head with a sigh, then revealed a faint smile. "But staying here indeed has many benefits. I still have many questions about Nascent Soul cultivation; it's time to study."
In the past, when they were in the sect, they didn't dare to seek guidance from masters. Their strength was insufficient, and too much interaction would inevitably lead to problems.
If a master-disciple relationship turned hostile, with the sect hunting them down, it would be quite unpleasant.
"The giant flying boat plan will require some refining. I'll need to seek advice on any principles I don't understand." Chen Xun's gaze gradually shifted to a Crane Spirit Tree in the dense forest. "Dragon bones and so on, it’s up to you, good brother..."
Suddenly, the Crane Spirit Tree Chen Xun was looking at began to sway with the snowy wind, making a rustling sound.
"Crane Spirit Tree, my good brother, how come, after breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, you seem more and more extraordinary?"
Chen Xun squinted slightly. They had encountered many spiritual trees on their journey, but none had the peculiar traits of the Crane Spirit Tree.
Especially the Jade Source Fruit Tree, which reached its peak at three thousand years. Even at its limit, it would at most wither and die, never producing death energy.
"Refining, my flying boat is quite large. Who knows how many materials it will need? I must carefully plan how to exchange for them." Chen Xun's eyes showed a thoughtful look as he organized his thoughts to proceed steadily. "I also need to consult those artifact refiners who make flying boats." Chen Xun's thoughts became increasingly clear. "As a mobile home for me and the old ox, using spirit stones as an energy source seems imprudent."
Thinking about it, Chen Xun's face showed a pained expression, firmly disagreeing with the idea.
Half a day later, a cow's bellow came from the cave mansion in the distance. Chen Xun gradually stood up and transformed into a blur of light, knowing the big black ox had finished setting up.
Inside the cave mansion, Chen Xun's divine sense instantly spread out, and his expression changed slightly as he encountered strong resistance.
"Moo~" The big black ox lay against the cave wall, its eyes showing an inexplicable sense of pride.
"Awesome!" Chen Xun exclaimed in admiration. "Old ox, you've improved again?!"
"Moo~~~!" The big black ox, invigorated by the praise, charged at Chen Xun, and nudged him. In the array formation world, various formations layered over each other.
Concealment, defense, attack, and operational consumption—the three primary formation flags wouldn't break, and as long as the five elements of heaven and earth persisted, the formations could keep running indefinitely.
Chen Xun clicked his tongue in amazement. Not only had the spiritual energy shackles been broken, but the formations given to the big black ox had also seen a significant enhancement.
Moreover, the big black ox's understanding of formations after breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage was truly exceptional, unmatched in the cultivation world, let alone breaking through them.
"Moo~~~" The big black ox let out a long snort, enjoying Chen Xun's reaction and feeling extremely satisfied.
"Old ox, you’ve really saved a lot of spirit stones." Chen Xun suddenly remarked, his gaze already on the cave wall. "Look at these crystals and jade stones."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox also turned its head to look around. Everywhere, there was a soft, milky white light, gentle yet not glaring, illuminating the cave mansion brightly.
