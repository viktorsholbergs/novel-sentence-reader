Li Tongya watched as Shamoli retreated respectfully. After reading the jade slip for a while, he heard footsteps approaching as Li Xuanxuan hurried into the courtyard.
"Second Uncle, you called for me?"
"Yes," Li Tongya responded, putting down the jade slip before continuing, "I asked you to gather information about the nearby Foundation Establishment Realm demonic cultivators… How is it going?"
Having dealt with the An Family, Li Tongya now intended to find a few talisman qi for the generation of Yuan and Qing. Once these matters were settled, he planned to cultivate in seclusion.
He had asked the fox in the mountains about the matter a few days ago, but Mount Dali was demon territory. Even the early Foundation Establishment Realm demons were well-known in the demon den, backed by late or peak Foundation Establishment Realm demons.
It would be a different matter entirely if one of them was killed by a disciple from the three sects and seven gates; however, the Li Family was simply a clan. Killing a demon could bring trouble to their doorstep overnight, especially if the demon were the descendant of a Purple Mansion Realm creature—being that even ordinary disciples from the immortal sects must treat with respect.
Li Tongya had thus asked Li Xuanxuan to send people out to investigate and it had been some time now, so he called him in for a follow-up inquiry. The southern Mount Dali and the eastern Lixia Prefecture seemed hopeless, so he hoped there might be opportunities in the territories of the Golden Tang Gate to the north or the Golden Feather Sect to the west.
Li Xuanxuan cupped his fist and replied, "I have some findings. To the west of Moongaze Lake is the Golden Feather Sect's territory, separated by a small wilderness and several minor families. No demons have been reported there. Going further west would be too far and inconvenient."
"As for the Golden Tang Gate's territory in the north..." Li Xuanxuan paused, lowering his voice as he continued, "It's currently in chaos. Demons run rampant while the prestigious clans are trying to annex each other. I believe there are Foundation Establishment Realm demons to be captured there. I have already dispatched additional people to investigate further."
"Oh?"
Li Tongya, intrigued by the situation at Golden Tang Gate, asked, "Have you found out the cause of it?"
Li Xuanxuan nodded and replied, "Over ten years ago, the Purple Mansion Realm ancestor of the Golden Tang Gate passed away, greatly weakening their strength. They had to rely on Azure Pond Sect for support. After a few years of stability, the last Purple Mansion Realm cultivator vanished, and many Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators within the sect also disappeared mysteriously. They could not even suppress the families and demons under their control, and this became particularly severe after Chi Wei's death. There are even rumors of devil cultivators appearing!"
Li Tongya remained silent, pondering for a moment before asking, "How have the other sects responded?"
Li Xuanxuan shook his head and answered, "Our information is limited. We only know that Azure Pond Sect has turned a blind eye to the situation, not sending a single person over. As for the other sects, we do not have much information."
Li Tongya sipped his tea and said softly, "Judging by Golden Tang Gate's state, the other sects likely have not taken any significant action as well. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator at Golden Tang Gate probably is not dead. At Senior Xiao Chuting's ceremony, I heard that Great Xu State, where the Golden Tang Gate is located, is now teeming with Buddhists, and many great powers are in conflict... Golden Tang Gate may have been caught up in this turmoil."
Li Xuanxuan acknowledged this with a nod and sighed, "With no one in the sect, information is scarce. We, the older generation, still have to rely on the generations of Xi and Yue to try their luck..."
Li Xuanxuan didn't have any strong objections to sending the younger generation to Azure Pond Sect, but Li Tongya felt uneasy. However, since having their disciples join Azure Pond was highly beneficial for the family, he had no choice but to accept it.
To change the subject, he glanced at Li Xuanxuan and instructed, "Keep investigating, and if necessary, write a letter to the Fei Family. Fei Wangbai is on the northern shore, close to the Golden Tang Gate, and his family used to be associated with it… He might have information."
"Understood!" Li Xuanxuan acknowledged.
There were two knocks at the door, and Li Xuanfeng entered quickly with a golden bow strapped onto his back. He cupped his fist and said, "Second Uncle, Liu Changdie has arrived at Mount Huaqian to set up the formation. It will cost fifty-eight Spirit Stones."
Seeing the confusion on Li Tongya's face, Li Xuanfeng continued, "I have also discussed this with Brother Xuan earlier. Liu Changdie is highly skilled in formation techniques, and it would be best if we could have him join the family. I previously tested the waters, and Liu Changdie wishes to become our family's guest elder in exchange for a perception technique as payment for setting up the formation."
Li Tongya pressed his hand against the table, contemplating for a moment. He was slightly hesitant, but he could not blame the younger generation for making their own decisions. He gave them an out, saying, "Liu Changdie has many secrets... It is hard to tell if that is good or bad. However, his skill in formations is indeed impressive. We still need him to set up the grand formation."
Li Xuanfeng paused slightly and replied slowly, "It is just a nominal position. It should be harmless..."
Li Tongya, being cautious by nature, was reluctant to take such a risk. He hesitated and then revealed some confidential information, shaking his head, "It is fine. As long as he takes the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath not to disclose it, we can lend him our perception technique. As for making him a guest elder... I have discussed this man with Xiao Yongling. According to him, Liu Changdie seems to have divination abilities, often predicting opportunities and gaining advantages. He seems to know a lot about various fortunes, which makes him… quite unusual.
"This man is so mysterious that even Ancestor Chuting keeps an eye on him. Although Liu Changdie believes his actions are discreet, he was quite conspicuous even when he was just a minor Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator. His exceptional talent in formations and his frequent travels made him stand out. There's no way he can escape the eyes of someone as astute as Xiao Chuting. On top of that, Liu Changdie is also involved in many strange occurrences and might bring trouble… It is not the right time to bring him into the family."
Hearing that Liu Changdie was so dangerous and had even caught the attention of the Xiao Family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, the two younger men felt a pang of regret. Li Xuanxuan was taken aback while Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow.
In the end, Li Xuanxuan sighed deeply and said, "Thank you for the advice, Second Uncle. I have almost caused trouble with my presumptuous decision!"
"That's an exaggeration..." Li Tongya waved his hand dismissively.
An awkward expression crossed Li Xuanfeng's as he remarked, "But… I have already agreed to his request and do not know how to refuse him now."
Li Xuanfeng, not as experienced in managing family affairs as Li Xuanxuan, had forged a friendship with Liu Changdie and felt awkward about directly refusing him.
Li Tongya, smiling, shook his head and replied reassuringly, "Give the perception technique to him, be generous and courteous, and tell him he can practice it. As for the matter of becoming a guest elder, just say that I am in seclusion and cannot give a reply at this moment, but you have decided to let him practice the technique first. He will be grateful and have no complaints."
Li Xuanfeng nodded in understanding, and Li Xuanxuan, stroking his beard, also nodded with a smile. "Everyone says that Second Uncle is composed and reserved, but they often overlooked your astute mind—steady yet decisive, truly a talent beyond the ordinary!" he praised.
Li Tongya clicked his tongue and waved his hand, chuckling.
"Stop flattering me, it makes me uncomfortable. Go and get the job done!" he scolded teasingly.
The two brothers laughed heartily and took their leaves respectfully.
"The last formation point!"
Thanks to the traces of the former Earth-Locked Huaqian Formation, the grand formation on Mount Huaqian was rapidly set up. If it weren't for the death of Wan Tianchou, the last orphan of the Wan Family in Lixia Prefecture, the formation could have been completed even faster.
Liu Changdie, directing a group of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators to carve the formation diagram, appeared quite pleased with himself. He was thrilled by the prospect of soon acquiring the Spirit Eye Perception, a skill that could significantly elevate his formation abilities.
He sighed inwardly with glee, thinking, Ah, this is the life! In my previous life, I was constantly hiding and wandering, gaining good Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation techniques too late because I was already cultivating with various unrefined qi! I remember how lost and dissatisfied I was in that life. I was barely living!
Now, relying on the cultivation methods and experiences from his previous life, he had significantly enhanced his qualifications. Although he could not gain any major opportunities, he managed to secure a wealth of cultivation resources by assisting others with formation diagrams. Naturally, his progress was rapid, and he was rather satisfied with his current state.
