Upon witnessing the celestial-like figure in a green robe gracefully descending into the courtyard, Li Xiangping felt a knot in his stomach.
Damn, could he be the owner of the mirror? he thought to himself.
In that instant, he was immediately on high alert, sensing the man’s otherworldly presence. He glanced at Li Chejing and Li Tongya; despite their calm exterior, their eyes betrayed a flicker of fear, seemingly mirroring his own thoughts.
“I am the Master of Qingsui Peak from the Azure Pond Sect,” the man introduced himself with a faint smile.
Noticing the Li Family’s guarded demeanor, he realized they were not the typical villagers who revered figures like him.
This strengthened his belief as he reassured them, “There’s no need for alarm. The Guli Road falls under the jurisdiction of the Azure Pond Sect. Since you’ve embarked on the path of immortal cultivation, you naturally come under our sect’s purview.”
Relieved that the visitor was not after the mirror, Li Tongya and the others visibly relaxed.
Li Tongya stepped forward, bowing respectfully. “We are simple villagers unaware of the larger world of cultivation. We unintentionally completed the Profound Scenery stage and are unfamiliar with esteemed sects like yours. Please forgive our ignorance.”
Si Yuanbai paused, realizing that these villagers were unaware of the Azure Pond Sect due to its long absence from this area. He performed a hand seal and cast a spell, creating a lifelike map of the Yue State in mid-air.
The Li Family was astounded by this display of power. While they had learned basic spells, creating such a map was beyond their capabilities, let alone a detailed one like this.
“This is Yue State,” Si Yuanbai explained, pointing to a blue spot that occupied about a quarter of Yue State. “And this is where the Azure Pond Sect is.”
“Ah, so that is the Azure Pond Immortal Sect." Li Mutian recognized, bowing in respect. “I recall seeing talismans from during my younger days with General Yang in the Mount Yue campaign. They were probably from the Azure Pond Immortal Sect.”
“We are but a humble part of the Immortal Sect,” Si Yuanbai responded modestly.
He then addressed Li Xiangping and his brothers, “Now that you have entered the Profound Scenery’s gate, you will oversee the nearby villages along this Guli Road. Just ensure that the annual contributions required by the sect are met.”
He continued, “There are several families along this Guli Road. Given your nascent roots, I advise you to be accommodating and avoid unnecessary disputes. Every five years, the sect will send representatives to recruit potential talents from the mountain. If your family can produce exceptional individuals, it will be greatly beneficial for you all.”
Li Tongya’s expression shifted subtly as he asked in a low voice, “About the contributions…”
“Every five years, we expect ten White Essence Fruits and two hundred jin[1] of Spirit Paddies,” Si Yuanbai replied matter-of-factly. “This quota is non-negotiable unless your family has disciples willing to join the Azure Pond Sect. Otherwise, the contribution requirements stand firm.”
As Si Yuanbai concluded, Li Tongya and the others exchanged knowing glances.
This timing isn’t coincidental. He chose to appear the moment Jing’er made a breakthrough, most likely hoping to recruit Jing’er into the Azure Pond Sect. Well, that might be for the best. Jing’er has truly exceptional talents, and it’s somewhat of a waste for him to be here in the mountains. Joining the immortal sect would be the best for his growth, and it would also be beneficial for the family to have him there, Li Mutian internally surmised.
With that in mind, Li Mutian subtly nodded at Li Chejing, who quickly understood his father’s intent. He bowed deeply to Si Yuanbai and respectfully said, “Although my talents are modest, I deeply admire the Peak Master’s prowess. I would be honored to join the Peak Master’s faction, even in the humblest capacity, to learn from his teachings.”
“Well said, you are indeed fit to join my Qingsui Peak,” Si Yuanbai responded happily while nodding.
He clapped his hand on his waist, and two bags of different sizes materialized on the ground.
Seeing the Li Family’s surprised expressions, he explained, “These are storage bags. You’ll be able to utilize them once you’ve completed the Jade Capital Chakra stage. The larger bag contains seeds for the Spirit Paddy, while the smaller one has White Essence Fruit kernels.”
Si Yuanbai then produced several wooden slips and added, “Since you’ve joined me, it’s only right you know my name. I am Si Yuanbai, a Peak Master in the Azure Pond Sect. I won’t overburden you by asking you to clean my peak.”
He handed over the slips and continued, “These three are cultivation techniques common in the Yue State. Your family might find them useful. The other slip details the cultivation of the Spirit Paddy and White Essence Fruit. Study them carefully.”
The Li Family members nodded in acknowledgment.
“Don’t be so tense. What cultivation techniques have you been practicing?” Si Yuanbai asked with a smile.
Li Xiangping and the others hesitated, exchanging glances. No one spoke for a moment.
Realizing their hesitation, Si Yuanbai quickly reassured them, “I understand, I understand. Your senior who instructed you must have told you to keep it a secret.”
Si Yuanbai had only attained the Foundation Establishment realm last year, so he naturally regarded the person who had presumably attained the same realm a decade ago as a senior.
At this, Li Mutian coughed and stepped forward, speaking softly, “Over ten years ago, I helped an injured senior who then recuperated at my home for a few years. He left us with these cultivation techniques and instructed us to keep them a secret before leaving…”
“I see!” Si Yuanbai gave him a gentle nod, feeling quite pleased with his own sagacity.
A simple Meridian Nourishment Sutra is all they possess. It can’t be some sophisticated immortal technique that involves gathering the essence of the moon or sun, can it? There’s no need to press them further. It might upset my new disciple, he thought to himself.
With a compassionate gaze toward the old man, Si Yuanbai conjured a light blue jade seal with a wave of his hand. As he caressed it, the seal began to glow with golden light, revealing the inscription—Governance of Azure Pond.
“This represents the authority of my Azure Pond Sect. I’ve put a magic seal on it. With this, you can demarcate your territory from neighboring clans and call upon the sect for assistance when needed. Take good care of it,” Si Yuanbai explained.
He gracefully handed the jade seal to Li Tongya. Watching Li Tongya safely stow it away, Si Yuanbai smiled warmly at Li Chejing and encouraged, “It’s time to bid farewell to your family, my good disciple.”
Li Chejing embraced his two older brothers with tears in his eyes, then knelt before Li Mutian, pressing his head to the ground a few times.
“Forgive me for being an unfilial son who can’t stay by you and Mother’s side in the future. Please take care, Father, and Mother as well.” His voice broke with emotion.
Li Mutian, clearing his throat, helped Li Chejing to his feet and reassured him, “Don’t worry, your older brothers will look after things here. Focus on your cultivation in the sect and make our Li Family proud.”
After bidding a final goodbye to his brothers, Li Chejing joined Si Yuanbai with a heavy heart. “Master, I have bid my farewell to my family,” he informed.
Si Yuanbai nodded, ignoring Li Tongya and the others who were kneeling and paying their respects to him.
He laughed heartily and mumbled to himself, “I guess I’ll let that Pig Demon live another day since I have acquired such a promising disciple today.”
With a wave of his hand, he summoned the shuttle, then cast a spell to elongate it enough to accommodate two people.
He grabbed Li Chejing’s hand, then boarded the shuttle, swiftly soaring northward like a shooting star.
