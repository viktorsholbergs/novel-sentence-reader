From the distance came the sound of clanging metal as Tu Longjian, clad in black, descended slowly. The black-and-red token beside him was suppressing a golden ring, causing it to tremble violently in midair, glowing red-hot as it burned.
"Cloudsunder has slipped away. I have lost its trail," he murmured.
Li Xuanfeng's expression remained impassive as he handed over Yu Muxian's storage pouch, speaking in a hoarse voice, "Many thanks for your tireless assistance. Here is this man's storage pouch—it has not been opened."
Tu Longjian hesitated briefly before opening the storage pouch. The Six Ding Merging Fire rose from within as he casually wiped away the seals and traps on the pouch.
Still nursing the wound on his abdomen, Tu Longjian didn't hold back, taking out valuable medicinal pills and elixirs for himself. He also removed a few healing salves, which he applied to Li Xuanfeng's injuries.
Yu Muxian's possessions were indeed of high quality. Li Xuanfeng's wounds began to heal visibly, the torn flesh knitting itself back together. Although the injuries on his hands remained, they were far less ghastly than before.
Tu Longjian rummaged through the storage pouch, retrieving a jade box, which he kept for himself, along with several other items. He then returned the storage pouch to Li Xuanfeng, who handed it to Xiao Yongling, saying softly: "Thank you, Senior. Please take a few items as compensation."
Xiao Yongling looked at him silently before hesitating slightly. He picked up two artifacts from the ground before glancing through the storage pouch. Meanwhile, Tu Longjian remarked softly, "Senior, there is still something of yours in that golden ring."
Tu Longjian intensified the flames, and after a few breaths, the two Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts ceased their battle. The Binding Ring let out a puff of black smoke, spitting out a small golden orb.
Li Xuanfeng caught a glimpse of it and suddenly recalled that the first arrow he had fired had been absorbed by the golden ring. After being worn down by the spirit artifact, tempered by the Merging Fire and Molten Fire, and subjected to various spells, it had been refined into its current state.
Xiao Yongling reached out to catch it. Returning the storage pouch to Li Xuanfeng, he also took out a gleaming golden halberd and offered it with both hands, saying softly, "The halberd that Tang Shedu coveted… it is now returned to its rightful owner."
This halberd had originated in the ancient Wei State, and calling it a rightful return was not far-fetched. Li Xuanfeng accepted it on behalf of the Li Family, giving the storage pouch only a brief glance. He left its contents untouched but instead displayed a pale purple circular object and asked, "Is this a Purple Mansion Realm talisman?"
Seeing the two nod, Li Xuanfeng replied, "I hope to use this talisman to stabilize my clan's fortunes. I will take nothing else from this pouch."
Pushing the storage pouch forward, he added, "This pouch itself… is something I cannot keep."
The storage pouch was indeed a dangerous item to hold. Tu Longjian nodded slightly and said softly, "Leave it to me."
The group divided the artifacts and found a mountain peak to rest on, silently meditating as they waited for the grotto heaven to close.
Within the grotto heaven, there was no cycle of day and night. Li Xuanfeng and the others meditated for several days, each recovering somewhat before finally opening their eyes.
Although the three sat quietly atop the mountain, none of them appeared at ease. The development of events had clearly diverged from Tu Longjian's expectations, leaving him hesitant to speak. At last, a rumbling sound echoed across the heavens, and the clouds surged like tidal waves. Tu Longjian said, "Honored Seniors, I still have pressing matters to attend to and cannot accompany you to the boundary. Please forgive me."
Li Xuanfeng and Xiao Yongling understood that Tu Longjian leaving so openly would undoubtedly lead him to the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators' hands. They bid him farewell nonetheless.
Tu Longjian hesitated for a moment before responding, "I deeply regret what happened to Senior Yuanjiao. If I manage to survive and establish myself in the Eastern Sea, I will rebuild the Slaughter Jun Gate. One day, I will come to visit and exchange techniques to revive the Slaughter Jun Dao Lineage."
Li Xuanfeng did not fully understand what connection his family had with the Slaughter Jun Gate, assuming this was Tu Longjian's reason for assisting them. Accepting the pledge on behalf of his family, he replied solemnly, "I am not clear on the details. Perhaps this was Yuanjiao's personal connection. However, the younger generation of my clan will remember your name and welcome you warmly."
Tu Longjian nodded, offered two words of condolence, and departed. Riding a fiery red streak of light, he vanished like a whirlwind into the horizon, sinking deep into the sea of clouds and disappearing from sight.
The two remaining figures rose into the air on the wind, only to find their surroundings gradually fading. The stars in the sky receded swiftly into the distance. Xiao Yongling waited for a moment before finally speaking softly, "My condolences…"
Li Xuanfeng waved a hand, the grief in his eyes flickering for only a moment before being replaced by deep restraint. Xiao Yongling observed his face carefully and spoke quietly, "Back during the slaughter in Lixia Prefecture, you and Ruyu pursued and executed members of the Situ Family in the name of justice. It all feels like yesterday. Decades have passed, and you seem so much different now."
Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze and replied, "What happened back then is like a bronze mirror sinking into water, dulled and worn down by sand and stone. Even if I revisit it, it remains hazy and unclear. Thinking of it now feels like recalling a past life—impossible to relive."
Xiao Yongling paused, unsure of how to respond. After a moment, he said softly, "Back then, I thought you were too sharp, that Ruyu was bound to be hurt by your brilliance. I even considered mentioning it to Tongya. But looking at you now, it is clear you surpassed Ruyu in every way. It seems I underestimated you and made a fool of myself."
Li Xuanfeng shook his head deeply, uninterested in continuing the conversation. Just as he was about to respond with some polite remarks, Xiao Yongling suddenly vanished. From head to toe, he disappeared completely, as did the stars, clouds, and mountains, which all faded away into the distance.
"The grotto heaven is closing!" Li Xuanfeng raised his gaze, finding himself surrounded entirely by the deep blue sea.
Beneath him were the same island and rocky shore from when he first entered. The formation he had set up at the beginning still glimmered faintly. Nearby, Lin Chensheng stood in black robes, clutching his chest. Crimson blood dripped steadily from between his fingers.
On the other side, Kan Ziyu collapsed to the ground with a thud. Sitting cross-legged, she immediately began meditating to recover. Li Xuanfeng scanned the island with his spiritual sense but found no trace of Zhong Qian. He surmised that Zhong Qian had likely met a grim fate—if not within the grotto heaven, then perhaps already in the hands of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.
Although Zhong Qian was absent, Li Xuanfeng saw a familiar figure nearby. Dressed in jade armor and holding a spear, her eyes rimmed with red, Li Qinghong stood there, staring intently at his hands.
"Qinghong!" Li Xuanfeng called out.
Li Qinghong nodded firmly, her throat tight with emotion. Uncertain of the situation, she dared not say much and choked out a brief response. Li Xuanfeng, having killed Yu Muxian, had no desire to linger. Bowing slightly with a cupped fist toward Lin Chensheng, he ascended on the wind and sped toward the marketplace on Splitreed Island.
As he took flight, Li Xuanfeng suddenly froze. The great void before him split open, trembling violently. From the rift stepped a man clad in platinum armor, his familiar halberd pointing directly at Li Xuanfeng. Behind the man stood an elder clad in green robes.
The elder's hair was white as a crane's feathers, yet his face was youthful. His nose was high and straight, and his eyes were etched with golden patterns. Behind him, a long, slender object rested silently. Standing in midair, the elder radiated a quiet but commanding presence. Beside him, a golden short sword hovered, buzzing sharply with its tip aimed directly at Li Xuanfeng.
The sword vibrated with a ringing hum, as though identifying its target. In the elder's other hand was a familiar golden ring, spinning slowly as it emitted a faint, whooshing sound, almost as if it were aggrieved.
Tang Shedu's aura was weak, his armor battered and fragmented, and his halberd bore two deep scars. His face, pale as gold paper, was far more haggard than when he had fled. In a hoarse voice, he said, "Daoist Master, it is him!"
