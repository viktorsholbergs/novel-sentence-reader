The rain over Moongaze Lake had continued for two months. The rainfall was clear and pure, causing the lake to swell and overflow, yet it made the entire body of water even more pristine. Li Chengliao activated his mana as he stood in the rain, gazing down.
In front of him, on the muddy shore, two rows of massive bluestone dikes stood tall. The rising waters of the lake had crept ever closer to two nearby towns. Just the night before, Li Xicheng had made a decision in the main hall, and by dawn, the stone dikes had emerged from the ground.
The lake water, created by a celestial anomaly, was not exactly a spirit treasure, but its sheer volume and flow had become quite powerful. Ordinary embankments could not withstand such force. If left unattended, the water might eventually flood the mountain foot.
Several unrefined Qi Cultivators were pacing along the dike, inspecting the formations. When they saw Li Chengliao looking their way, they respectfully cupped their fist and bowed. Li Chengliao, always warm and composed, nodded graciously and personally checked the dikes.
Building such embankments was no major task for the Li Family, but since it concerned the livelihood of the people, Li Chengliao, as the one managing the clan's affairs, naturally had to oversee it himself. Despite his father, Li Xicheng, being the family head, Li Chengliao had been taught since childhood not to grow complacent.
Standing next to him was his uncle, An Siwei, who held a long spear. The An Family had an excellent bloodline, and An Siwei was now at the eighth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm, skilled in multiple techniques and boasting considerable strength.
Li Chengliao finished his inspection quickly and descended, landing near a group of cultivators gathering in the rain. He said, "The construction is decent. Patrol carefully. If this embankment fails and the water floods the towns…"
An elderly cultivator wearing a conical hat immediately cupped his fist and assured him, "Young master, rest assured. The clan rules are etched in our hearts."
Satisfied, Li Chengliao departed. As he flew toward the foot of the mountain, his brows remained furrowed, reflecting his troubled thoughts.
By his calculations, his wife, Madam Hu, had been pregnant for eleven months now, yet there was no sign of delivery.
He politely dismissed An Siwei and entered the backyard. Pushing open the side chamber door, he found his wife lying on a couch, her face pale and drowsy. Li Chengliao sat beside her and, noticing her lips were nearly colorless, frowned slightly.
"What is going on?" He called out, and his gaze fell on the traces of shattered porcelain on the ground.
A nearby maid trembled and replied softly, "Madam… Madam has already drunk a great deal of water…"
Li Chengliao had noticed this issue for some time. Now, when he touched his wife's forehead, he found her body burning hot. The ominous feeling in his chest deepened. He looked her over carefully, growing anxious as he tucked the covers around her. Rising abruptly, he began pacing and said, "Take good care of her. I will head to Qingdu."
Quickly, he strode out of the hall, grabbed the white robe hanging at the entrance, and draped it over his shoulders. The usually calm and composed look on his face darkened with worry. He shot into the air, wind swirling as he flew straight toward Mount Qingdu, only to remember that his eighth uncle, Li Xijun, was in seclusion.
Gritting his teeth, Li Chengliao turned and flew to Talisman Peak to seek the Grand Elder, Li Xuanxuan.
Talisman Peak was eerily empty. Li Xuanxuan had never liked keeping servants around, even from his youth. Li Chengliao easily entered the main hall. As he approached, he heard a powerful, sonorous voice from within, "Ning Dingbo reports that Yuan Tuan has been sent to the Eastern Sea markets. If you ask me, the Yuan Family…"
The voice's owner seemed to sense him and stopped abruptly. Li Chengliao quickly kneeled, bowed deeply, and said respectfully, "Chengliao greets the two great ancestors."
Li Xuanfeng, whose presence was the most imposing of all, stood as a towering figure of reverence within the family. Li Chengliao, though composed, felt his heart drum nervously. Bowing low, all he could see were the long boots inlaid with black and gold. From above, he heard Li Xuanxuan's low voice introduce him, "This is your grandnephew, Li Chengliao."
Li Xuanfeng gave a soft response, allowing Li Chengliao to rise. Li Chengliao quickly stood up, his eyes meeting this fearsome elder for the first time.
Surprisingly, those dark gray eyes did not appear as severe as rumored; instead, they carried a faint warmth as he looked Li Chengliao up and down.
Li Xuanfeng seemed to be reminiscing about something, though Li Chengliao dared not delay. He spoke in a serious tone, "My wife… it has been eleven months since her first pregnancy, but there are no signs of delivery. On the contrary, her condition is weakening. I have used spells to investigate multiple times but found nothing."
"Mm?" Li Xuanxuan was slightly startled and responded, "I will go down and see—"
"I will come as well." Li Xuanfeng's words made Li Chengliao ecstatic. This elder's reputation for knowledge and experience far exceeded anyone else's in the family. Overjoyed, he quickly led them out.
As Li Xuanfeng stepped forward, he turned to Li Xuanxuan and commented, "The descendants of the central branch always seem to possess a rare steadiness and calm."
Li Xuanxuan nodded quietly in agreement as they stepped out of the grand formation. However, Li Xuanfeng suddenly stopped, his eyes narrowing as his expression turned stern.
He reached both hands behind his back, where an exaggerated golden longbow appeared, its form radiant and formidable. Li Xuanxuan sensed something amiss and looked up at the sky. The heavy clouds over Moongaze Lake had begun to disperse.
The rain that had fallen steadily for half a year gradually ceased. The thick clouds vanished, and the sun broke through, illuminating the land. Though a faint drizzle remained, sunlight now shone down brightly.
A dazzling glow began rising from the sky, filling it with brilliance. Though the rain still poured, its presence seemed otherworldly. Li Xuanfeng's eyes glowed with golden light as his perception technique activated.
Through his vision, near the foot of Mount Lijing, a golden-yellow cloud—almost white—began to rise. It radiated brightly, perfectly circular like a canopy, hanging suspended in midair.
Li Xuanfeng took two steps and descended into the mountain. Li Xuanxuan and Li Chengliao followed closely behind. As they entered, Li Xuanfeng observed the faint wisp of cloud rising from the hall and said in a low voice, "Activate the formation first."
Li Xuanxuan formed seals and cast the spell. Brilliant white light rose from the mountain, forming a barrier-like screen that sealed off the area. The two elders stepped inside.
The courtyard, previously neat with stone tables and chairs, was now overwhelmed with white. Large and small white cicadas covered the ground, piled on top of one another, leaving no place to step. Their sharp cries pierced the air. Several maids lay collapsed on the ground, as the white cicadas crawled through their clothing, flapping their wings and attempting to take flight.
Li Chengliao was visibly shaken. Li Xuanfeng, however, stepped forward calmly and caught one of the white cicadas. As soon as it landed in his hand, it turned into gold-white smoke and vanished.
He stepped forward again, and the faint rustling sounds ceased entirely. The scene before them disappeared without a trace, leaving only the unconscious maids on the ground. Li Chengliao rushed inside, while Li Xuanxuan asked in a low voice, "Is this an anomaly?"
"Indeed." Li Xuanfeng responded and entered the inner chamber with a mix of worry and relief on his face. The two elders had just crossed the threshold when they heard a child's innocent laughter.
Inside, the room was in complete disarray. Furniture lay overturned, and the scene was chaotic. A creature, neither tiger nor wolf, lay in the center. It had two jade-like white horns on its head and carried a damp infant gently in its mouth.
Li Chengliao kneeled down immediately, removing the white robe draped over his shoulders and spreading it beneath the creature, fearful that it might drop the child.
Crack…
