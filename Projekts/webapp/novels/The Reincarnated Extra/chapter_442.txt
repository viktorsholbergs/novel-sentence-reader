The Last Kobudai War
* * *
<<<…Mm…>>>
Kobdalian awoke, feeling a breeze gently caress his cheek.
And he slowly opened his eyes.
What he saw was the usual scenery of the Eserem Sea of Fog.
In other words, fog, all around.
He’s on his favorite plateau, where he can look down on the “former” Red Kobu Tribe village… but unfortunately, he can’t enjoy the beautiful scenery right now.
<<<Awake? >>>
He heard that voice from the side, along with a chuckle.
Glancing over, he saw Kobdaroze there.
The Kobudai who was a warrior in that war… and now Kobdalian’s lifelong partner.
His hump has shrunk considerably since the war… and he, no, she, has completely reverted back to female.
There are few examples of male-to-female sex changes in the long history of the Flying Kobudai clan.
The cause is unknown.
However, Kobdaroze…
And neither did Kobdalian.
They have no objections to this outcome.
Because it was what they both desired.
<<<Is the ‘Grand Clan Chief’ taking a nap? Huhu, you’re living the good life, aren’t you? >>>
<<<…Hmph.>>>
Kobdalian grunted, embarrassed, being teased by his wife for taking a nap.
Kobdalian’s strength visibly declined after that war, and he started sleeping more.
But even so, he was still strong, and above all, he’s a hero who survived a battle with the Calamity… and even resealed it.
Therefore, after the war, the role he was given was ‘Grand Clan Chief’.
He grew into the leader who united all the Flying Kobudai clans, red, blue, black… all the colors that had been fighting.
<<<…I was dreaming…>>>
<<<Dreaming? >>>
<<<A dream… of the ‘Last Kobudai War’.>>>
Yawning largely, Kobdalian muttered that.
And then, he started vaguely organizing his memories of the end of that war.
* * *
The end of that war.
The moment Kobdalian, cooperating with the monster, pressed the Sealing Starfish against Calamity Humidafai…
The Sealing Starfish suddenly began to glow intensely.
At the same time, cloth and ropes, like vines of a plant, began to grow rapidly from the back of the starfish, wrapping around the mountain-like shell of Humidafai.
“““BUSHUWAWAWA!?”””
Whether it was in pain, or not… he couldn’t tell from the expressionless super giant turban shell.
But anyway, Humidafai blew air from the tip of its shell, as if in a panic, and then…
It quickly retracted its body, which had been extended all over the bottom of the giant hole, into its shell, as if rewinding time.
Zuz… zuzu… zuzuzuzu…!
And then, Humidafai, with a roaring sound and a cloud of dust, started burrowing deep, deep into the ground.
After a while, Humidafai, which had boasted a majestic, rocky mountain-like appearance, only had the tip of its shell remaining above ground… and from there, it started emitting fog with a loud sound.
This means that this Calamity has fallen back asleep, returning to its pre-sealed state… and confirming that, Kobdalian lost consciousness, the tension leaving his body.
Kobdalian was then rescued by Kobdaroze, who woke up earlier and came looking for him, and they left the forbidden grounds.
* * *
It was truly a terrible battle.
But Kobdalian and Kobdaroze’s battle didn’t end there.
The Calamity was resealed.
However, in this Eserem Sea of Fog, there are many large and dangerous creatures that prey on Kobudai.
And in this war, the warriors who are responsible for protecting the villages have been drastically reduced.
The Black Kobu Tribe, especially, was in a terrible state.
It seems that Kobdarok deployed almost all the warriors who could fight in that war… and when Kobdalian and the others left the forbidden grounds and passed near the Black Kobu Tribe village… they found that many of the defenseless women and children had become prey for a giant shark that attacked the village.
Kobdalian, despite his battered body, fought the shark and saved them. That was the beginning of his journey as ‘Grand Clan Chief’.
Kobdalian, leading the survivors of the Black Kobu Tribe back to the Red Kobu Tribe village, started running a new village there, one that doesn’t discriminate by color.
They have almost no warriors left.
It’s no longer the time to fight amongst themselves.
All Kobudai have to cooperate with each other to survive.
That era has arrived.
The Blue Kobu Tribe also soon joined Kobdalian and the others, with a small number of warriors and children.
It seems that Kobdacleva had given strict orders to the surviving Blue Kobu warriors: ‘If both he and Kobdarok are destroyed, immediately go to Kobdalian’.
That was… right after the Red and Blue Kobudai meeting ended.
There were some twists and turns after that, but fortunately, the Kobudai of Kobdalian’s… the Kobudai of ‘Kobudai Village’… are living peacefully.
Living a peaceful life… without any conflict between Kobudai.
* * *
<<<…>>>
A strong wind shook Kobdalian’s body as he sat silently, reminiscing about his journey.
That wind, blowing with a ‘byuu’ sound, blew away the surrounding fog… and revealed the current state of the village below.
There, children of various colors were playing together!
Although there’s still some awkwardness… young warriors, born after the war, are joining fins, regardless of color, guarding the village!
Seeing that, Kobdalian… frowned.
<<<What’s with that face? Isn’t it a peaceful, wonderful sight? >>>
Kobdaroze pouted.
<<<Of course, I think so.>>>
Kobdalian muttered, his face still grim.
<<<That’s why I’m scared. I’m scared of losing this peace. I… as Grand Clan Chief… I have to protect this peace… and that… scares me.>>>
<<<…>>>
<<<I told you before, right? That ‘I’m just acting like a strong Kobudai’? The truth is… Kobdalian is… a coward… a weakling…>>>
Hearing that confession, Kobdaroze…
<<<Fufu.>>>
…Chuckled softly.
<<<Even though you’re aware that ‘you’re actually weak’… you continue to fight as Grand Clan Chief. You, who can do that, are undoubtedly a strong Kobudai.>>>
She snuggled up to Kobdalian.
<<<I guarantee it!>>>
She asserted that, powerfully!
<<<I see… You guarantee it, Kobdaroze! Hahaha, then there’s no doubt!>>>
Kobdalian smiled at her words, laughed loudly, and then looked up at the sky.
Their god, Godkob, is not there.
After that war… Godkob completely disappeared.
Now that the Calamity has been safely resealed, his role as a god has ended for the time being, and he’s probably returned to the world of the gods to rest.
That’s what they assume in Kobudai Village.
And speaking of things that haven’t been seen… that bipedal monster also hasn’t appeared before the Kobudai again.
By the time Kobdaroze reached Kobdalian after Humidafai’s resealing, the monster had already disappeared.
Sometimes, he feels a terrifying presence from the shadows of the rocks… so perhaps she was lurking there at those times…
But anyway, no Kobudai has been attacked by that monster since that war.
But the fear still lingers, and now, children are disciplined by being threatened, ‘If you do bad things, the black, bipedal monster will appear and eat you from the head down!’
Anyway.
The era of war is over.
Now is the era of peace.
However, protecting that peace is also a battle for Kobdalian.
He will continue to fight.
As a warrior.
To protect… his loved ones…
Looking at the Kobudai village, once again enveloped in fog, Kobdalian renewed his determination, fighting spirit burning in his eyes.
Kobdaroze, blushing at his expression…
<<<Well, break time is over!>>>
…Said that, and slapped Kobdalian with her tail.
<<<First… apologize to everyone for sneaking out and slacking off!>>>
She said that with a gentle smile.
<<<…Won’t you… apologize with me…? >>>
<<<No way!>>>
The story continues a bit more.
