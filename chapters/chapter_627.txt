Li Xizhi sighed silently at their words, understanding their intent to console him. Speaking softly, he said, "Do you know why the Dawn Rayfish are drawn to rainbows?"
The two were taken aback, both delighted that Li Xizhi had finally spoken and puzzled by his sudden words. They asked a question in return, to which Li Xizhi replied, "Feathered beasts belong to the category of pristine and radiance, such as feathered serpents and Luan birds. Scaled beasts, on the other hand, follow convergence and merging, including creatures like demonic dragons and scaled-crows. The Dawn Rayfish, with its feathered wings and scaly body, exists between the two categories."
"Between these two categories, water disperses, and light converges, harmonizing and complementing one another—that is what forms rainbows." Li Xizhi spoke softly, "The last predecessor to cultivate the Dawn Dew Gathering Technique was Lingu Xia. His mount was the Venomous Eagle, another half-scaled, half-feathered demonic creature."
Yuan Chengzhao sighed and said, "When I was young and mischievous, I did not value studying. Now, all I can do is admire you, Senior Brother... It seems these five categories—feathered, scaled, furry, bare, and winged—all have their own connections to Dao lineage. The depth of knowledge here is truly boundless."
The group flew on for a while, and soon Yuan Family's Mushroom Forest Plain came into view. Yuan Chengzhao's expression darkened, and with a word of farewell, he descended. With Moongaze Lake now so close, Li Xizhi's mood sank once more.
Mount Qingdu.
For more than a year, the northern prefectures of Yue State had seen no more torrential downpours, but steady drizzles persisted. Paddies, millet, and beans withered in the fields, deprived of sunlight, leaving nothing to harvest.
Fortunately, the Li Family had enjoyed abundant harvests in prior years and maintained ample reserves. Grain was distributed to households according to protocol. Though there were unavoidable instances of corruption and greed, the family's wealth and resources prevented any major crises.
Li Yuanjiao's funeral had been conducted early, and only after that did news from Green Pine Temple begin to spread. Cultivators from across the land belatedly arrived to offer their condolences.
After all, the Li Family had slain a disciple of Yuanwu Peak and still stood unharmed. Although Li Yuanjiao had perished, the incident only further demonstrated the family's deep foundation and formidable connections.
These people, though unaware of the full details, didn't let that stop them from currying favor. Li Xuanfeng had vanished into the southern border, but the Li Family at Moongaze Lake couldn't simply uproot and leave.
As the news spread, the Li Family estate became increasingly crowded with visitors. Li Yuexiang, clad in mourning attire, was known to be Li Yuanjiao's orphan. Anyone with a modicum of sense could guess she had inherited untold treasures. Coupled with her striking beauty, she became the object of desire for many families, who nearly trampled down the estate's threshold in their eagerness to secure her favor.
"Go… send that letter back!" Li Xuanxuan waved off the servant with visible irritation. These visitors rarely managed to disturb him directly, but even the Han Family from Dongliu Island had sent people to inquire. The situation was gradually spiraling out of control, and Li Xuanxuan feared that if mishandled, several powerful families might be offended.
He furrowed his brows and, for once, allowed a rare expression of annoyance to surface. In a low voice, he muttered, "How ironic! Now the place is bustling with visitors!"
In life, Li Yuanjiao had not earned widespread renown. Yet, the sheer number of mourners after his death seemed almost absurd, a cruel irony that only deepened the discomfort in Li Xuanxuan's heart.
Just as he began to settle, a commotion erupted outside. Several people rushed in noisily, their hurried steps chaotic and their voices loud. One of them shouted, "Elder, the Master has returned! The Master has returned!"
Another person, trousers soaked and disheveled as if having just rushed in from the rain, called out, "Elder! People from Profound Peak Gate have arrived!"
With Li Xijun still in seclusion, Li Xuanxuan had temporarily taken charge of the mountain's affairs. The two disciples, who had been personally trained by him, were loyal but somewhat lacking in decorum. Sighing, he intercepted one of them and asked, "Which Master?"
"The Master from the Immortal Sect!" The disciple replied.
Li Xuanxuan immediately stood and rushed outside. As expected, he saw several figures standing beyond the protective formation. The elderly man let out an "Ah!" of surprise and hurried to open the formation.
Li Xizhi, waiting outside, noticed a woman standing nearby in a flaxen-colored gown. Her features were characteristic of the Zhehe region in northern Yue—her face round, her dark brows delicately arched, with a refined and sweet charm. Yet, her tightly pressed lips betrayed a hint of sorrow.
"She seems to be wearing the robes of Profound Peak Gate," Li Xizhi noted silently.
The woman seemed to notice him as well. She called out, "Fellow Daoist… which immortal sect are you from?"
Li Xizhi and his wife disliked wearing Azure Pond Sect robes, but the profound-patterned feathered robe he wore clearly marked him as someone of extraordinary origin. Hearing the question, Li Xizhi cupped his fist and replied, "Li Xizhi of Qingsui."
"Oh, I see…" The woman's expression softened at once.
She was about to speak when Li Xuanxuan hurried out, staring at Li Xizhi for a moment before exclaiming, "Good!"
Grandfather has grown so old! Li Xizhi thought with a pang of sorrow. He barely recognized the frail old man standing before him.
However, with guests still present, Li Xuanxuan took charge. Pulling Li Xizhi aside, he turned to the flaxen-robed woman and said, "So, it is Daoist Tingyun! Please, come inside the formation."
Kong Tingyun nodded politely and returned the gesture, stepping gracefully onto the peak. Following custom, she burned paper, paid her respects, and quickly withdrew from the main hall. Li Xizhi and the others waited for her outside.
Li Yuanjiao had been deceased for quite some time. As cultivators, they refrained from adhering to excessive mortal rituals, accompanying Kong Tingyun as she exited.
Kong Tingyun, careful not to stir up sorrow, avoided mentioning the past. Instead, she spoke softly, "Among the six jade boxes in the Green Pine Grotto Heaven, two have gone missing. Have any of you heard anything about them?"
Seeing Li Xuanxuan shake his head, Kong Tingyun said, "According to the various Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, these six jade boxes each had an intended owner. I have heard that a few of them have already gone missing or been emptied. My family's ancestor mentioned that some Daoist Masters have been quite unhappy about the matter."
Li Xuanxuan initially wanted to follow the conversation and ask how Daoist Master Changxi had fared in this situation. However, considering Changxi's awkward position within the sect, it was likely he hadn't gained much. He decided to change the subject, replying, "When Daoist Masters divide these treasures, it is inevitable there will be not enough to go around. Conflict is unavoidable…"
Kong Tingyun hesitated for a moment. It seemed as though she wanted to say something but swallowed her words, her expression darkening as she thought, The ancestor truly has no sense of tact. Asking me to arrange for Li Xuanfeng to meet Yuan Su at this time is so inconsiderate. Best to wait a little longer…
Finally, she cupped her fist, her expression softening as she looked at Li Xizhi and said gently, "Your father and I shared a good relationship during his lifetime. You are welcome to visit Profound Peak and spend time with us whenever you like."
Kong Tingyun, unsure of Li Xizhi's temperament, didn't dare to overpromise or commit to anything too specific. However, Li Xizhi recognized the sincerity in her words and nodded politely in return.
Without further delay, Kong Tingyun departed, riding the wind away. Only after her departure did Li Xizhi turn back to Li Xuanxuan and remark, "It seems… that Senior truly had a close bond with Father."
Li Xuanxuan waved dismissively, as he himself didn't know the full extent of their relationship. Setting the topic aside, he carefully looked Li Xizhi up and down before sighing, "You have also broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. All of you brothers are making remarkable progress. Now, we are only waiting on Xijun!"
"Xijun is in seclusion?!" Li Xizhi froze, his tone growing anxious. "Why did he not send a letter to inform us? Did he have the necessary pills prepared?"
After saying this, Li Xizhi suddenly recalled that he had also been in seclusion himself. Even if Xijun had sent a letter, it wouldn't have reached him. Realizing this, he could only silently send his blessings in his heart.
Li Xuanxuan, however, turned to Yang Xiao'er, giving her a once-over. After studying her carefully, he nodded approvingly and said, "She is sensible and well-mannered."
Yang Xiao'er opened her mouth as if to speak but hesitated, a hint of anxiety showing on her face. The old man, noticing this, smiled faintly. Naturally understanding her concerns, he said softly, "I will take you both to see Huai'er."
