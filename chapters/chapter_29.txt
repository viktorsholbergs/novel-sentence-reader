Li Xiangping was slightly taken aback by Wan Yuankai’s gesture and could not help but feel a bit wary. Internally, he cautioned himself about the Wan Family’s overenthusiasm while maintaining a cordial smile on his face.
He politely cupped his fist to Wan Yuankai, but firmly shook his head and said, “We appreciate your father’s kindness, but we really can’t accept the gift!”
However, Wan Yuankai persisted, unveiling a small pine box from his sleeve. He opened the well-polished box to reveal a unique greenish-white fruit nestled on a bed of cloth and silk.
The fruit’s surface, resembling snake scales in its smoothness, shone in the sunlight, giving it an appealing appearance.
Wan Yuankai, looking slightly embarrassed, said softly, “My family is struggling both internally and externally. This Pine Yue Fruit can aid in condensing the Radiant Lure Chakra, though it’s a humble offering. Please, Brother Li, accept this so I can fulfill my duty.”
As Li Xiangping examined the fruit, Wan Yuankai quickly explained, “You can simply slice open the skin and drink the juice inside.”
Li Xiangping, gazing at the fruit, weighed the implications of accepting it.
The Wan family is already struggling, so why share this with us? Wouldn’t that be unnecessarily inviting others to covet what they have?
Resolving to see where this gesture would lead, Li Xiangping laughed heartily and decisively said, “All right, I’ll accept it!”
He watched as Li Yesheng stepped forward to take the box, handling it with care.
Switching to a more serious tone, Li Xiangping then said, “But I do have a request, Brother Wan.”
Wan Yuankai waved his hands and humbly replied, “You can just call me Yuankai. What do you need?”
Li Xiangping explained, “We’re new to the area, so my family doesn’t know much about the neighboring families. Would you be willing to help us get acquainted?”
“Of course, I’d be happy to help.” Wan Yuankai nodded and readily agreed.
Li Yesheng fetched a piece of paper and a brush. He rolled his sleeves up, then drew a thin line and explained, “This is Guli Road.”
He then drew a circle in the middle of the line and marked it with the Li character.
Li Xiangping nodded, then took over the brush. After dipping it into the ink, he added two more circles above and below the Li character, marking them as Moongaze Lake and Mount Dali respectively.
“The Li Residence is situated between Mount Dali and Moongaze Lake, intersected by the Guli Road,” Li Xiangping elaborated.
Wan Yuankai then drew another small circle to the right of the Li Residence’s location and said, “The Wan Residence is to the East.”
He continued, drawing a larger circle above the Wan Residence and solemnly explained, “This is Ji Family from the Golden Tang Gate.”
“Ji Family from the Golden Tang Gate?” Li Xiangping repeated the name with a hint of concern.
“Yes… The Golden Tang Gate is a powerful immortal sect based in the Northern Great Xu. They are on par with our Azure Pond Sect. The vast Moongaze Lake separates us; to the North of the lake lies their stronghold, Mount Tangdao. The Ji Clan falls under the governance of the Golden Tang Gate,” Wan Yuankai explained.
Li Xiangping nodded, encouraging Wan Yuankai to continue, while internally bracing himself for unwelcome news.
“For over a decade, there has been ongoing tension between the Golden Tang Gate and our Azure Pond Sect. While there’s been no outright war, the border conflicts have already led to the destruction of numerous families and the displacement of countless mortals. It’s been a continuous exchange of probing maneuvers from both sides,” Wan Yuankai said, his expression revealing a deep sense of unease as if he had just articulated concerns that had been troubling him for quite some time.
He continued, “The Ji Clan repeatedly trespassed into our territory, causing us great distress. Years ago, Ji Dengqi, the head of the Ji Family, had already attained the Qi Cultivation realm. Meanwhile, my father was just starting to condense the Jade Capital Chakra—it was clear he was outmatched.”
“Every time our Spirit Paddies were ready for harvest, someone from the Ji Family would come disguised as a veiled rogue cultivator and plunder our village. We were forced to hide in the mountains for years, helplessly watching them steal our Spirit Paddies.”
As Wan Yuankai spoke, his eyes reddened and he clenched his fists in anger.
After hearing his story, Li Xiangping could already guess the intention of his visit. With a grim expression, he said, “The Li Family’s strength is limited. I’m afraid we can’t be of much assistance.”
Seeing the indignant look on Wan Yuankai’s face, Li Xiangping quickly asked, “How many immortal cultivators does your Wan Family have?”
Wan Yuankai hesitated for a moment, then looked at Li Xiangping. Gritting his teeth, he revealed, “My father is at the peak of the Jade Capital Chakra. I’ve condensed the Azure Essence Chakra, and we have two juniors who have just condensed the Profound Scenery Chakra. The Ji Family, aside from that wicked Ji Dengqi, who has completed the Qi Cultivation Realm, has two at the Profound Scenery Chakra and one at the Radiant Lure Chakra. They also have a few others at the Profound Scenery Chakra, but they don’t come together to steal from us.”
Li Xiangping, puzzled, asked, “Someone from the sect told me that in times of enemy attacks, our jade seal can be used to request for help from the sect. They’ll send an immortal cultivator who has attained the Foundation Establishment Realm to resolve our immediate crisis, no?”
“There’s no way we can call on an immortal cultivator in the Foundation Establishment Realm!” Wan Yuankai exclaimed in frustration, gnashing his teeth and clenching his fists.
“Activating the jade seal requires at least four hours for the qi cultivators from the city to arrive. By then, it would be too late. Not only is our Spirit Paddies gone, but repeatedly calling for help will inadvertently offend the cultivators who came to our aid!”
Before Li Xiangping could respond, Wan Yuankai hurriedly added, “My father’s decision to visit your family and propose an alliance is a bid to borrow your clan’s strength…”
Since Wan Yuankai had stated his request, Li Xiangping had to give up probing for more information. He sighed inwardly and smiled wryly.
“We wish we could help, but our resources are limited. My family only recently began cultivating. Of my father’s four sons, the eldest passed away early. Although the youngest shows promising talent, he’s currently away to cultivate at the immortal sect. My brother and I are still novices in cultivation, not nearly as advanced as you. We’re not properly equipped to confront the Ji Family.”
Clinging to hope, Wan Yuankai suggested, “What about your father then?”
“The truth is… my father is a mortal…”
“Impossible! A mere mortal fathering three children with spiritual orifices?! My father, who has condensed the Jade Capital Chakra, had seventeen children and I’m the only one with a spiritual orifice!” Wan Yuankai exclaimed incredulously.
Li Xiangping, taken aback by Wan Yuankai’s reaction, quickly improvised, “My father’s cultivation was crippled during a battle in his younger days…”
Realizing his presumption, Wan Yuankai shamefully apologized, “I have spoken thoughtlessly. Your father must have been a great cultivator before his cultivation was crippled.”
As Wan Yuankai sank into his seat, filled with disappointment, Li Xiangping was drenched in cold sweat. That moment of interrogation had nearly unraveled his facade.
So, the achievement of a cultivator directly influences the chances of their offspring having a spiritual orifice. I overlooked this important detail and nearly blew it!
Observing Wan Yuankai’s dispirited expression, Li Xiangping composed himself and broached a new topic.
“Are you aware of what lies at the end of the Guli Road, to the West of my family’s residence?” he asked.
“West of Guli Road…” The question caught Wan Yuankai off guard.
He looked at the map and pondered for a moment before replying, “Mount Dali slopes Westward, and the Guli Road leads into the mountains in that direction. I’ve not heard of any settlements there, but…”
“What have you heard?” Li Xiangping pressed.
“My father mentioned that our ancestors explored that area before and encountered inhabitants of Mount Yue.”
“Inhabitants of Mount Yue?”
