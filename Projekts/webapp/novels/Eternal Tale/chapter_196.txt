In the Flower Rain Valley, a towering light and shadow were shrouded in the mist of the Five Elements' Qi. It restrained all spiritual energy, suppressed all spiritual energy, was invisible to the naked eye, imperceptible to divine sense, and untouchable by cultivation.
The female cultivators of Nine Palaces Mountain were shaken to their cores, feeling only the overwhelming pressure, their spiritual energy flowing sluggishly, not daring to look at the vague light and shadow in the sky.
Jiang Xuechen's eyelids twitched uncontrollably, uncertain of what grand spell those two elders were casting, as that blurry light and shadow exuded such terrifying spiritual pressure.
She never even considered that it might be a Nascent Soul. After all, she had encountered a few ancestors, and none of them had a Nascent Soul that was this immense!
This was something that completely overturned the understanding of the cultivation world—absolutely impossible.
The image with five heads and ten arms was hidden the deepest; no one dared to approach and investigate. It's estimated that knowing the truth might cause a heart attack, leading to a reverse flow of spiritual energy and a perilous situation.
"Spiritual pressure... what exactly is it?" Jiang Xuechen murmured to herself, seated in the grand hall, having heard many legends about it.
Some said it was the ultimate refinement of spiritual energy, invincible among peers. Others claimed it was ancient prodigies who tempered their spiritual energy and reabsorbed it into themselves, at a time when resources were abundant and lifespans were sufficiently long.
But opinions varied, and although there seemed to be many methods to enter that realm of spiritual pressure, none had succeeded. The cultivation alone was enough to exhaust most of a cultivator's energy and lifespan.
Jiang Xuechen shook her head with a sigh, then smiled slightly, relieved that those two elders were not enemies.
Her gaze gently turned back to the sky, where the vast spiritual pressure began to spread in all directions, even affecting the Snow Listening Valley.
In the Flower Rain Valley, Chen Xun stood in midair, eyes slightly closed, his entire body undergoing a shocking transformation, though his expression was grim.
Damn it, a loss.
The only thought in Chen Xun's mind was this: in fact, this path could have been explored during the Golden Core stage, but he had delayed it for so many years.
"Perhaps I no longer need the Five Elements Spiritual Roots."
He murmured, his entire body igniting with the multicolored Five Elements Fire. At this moment, there was no spiritual energy left in the Flower Rain Valley.
Cultivators are most sensitive to spiritual energy, easily discerning where it is abundant and where it is scarce.
But the Five Elements' Qi, existing between heaven and earth, is endless and inexhaustible, yet no cultivator could fully utilize it; spiritual roots are the greatest limitation.
It is also the fair limit imposed by the heavens on all living beings. All things have spirits, deriving spiritual roots, breaking through their shackles, and giving all beings a chance to tread the path of immortality.
At this moment, Chen Xun's expression showed no change, nor was there the slightest sign of pain. His demeanor was like that of an old monk in meditation.
The indifference in the eyes of the light and shadow formed by the Five Elements Nascent Soul grew stronger, constantly inhaling and exhaling vast amounts of the Five Elements' Qi.
The Five Elements' Qi wildly interwove in the void, and the chains of spiritual energy around Chen Xun's body kept snapping.
The disorderly Five Elements' Qi in the world erupted like a volcano, surging towards the image of Chen Xun's five heads and ten arms, as if to engulf the entire universe!
At the same time, an incomparably vast wave spread out, and various terrifying phenomena emerged.
At this moment, everyone on Nine Palaces Mountain was shocked to the core, feeling a terrifying chill, as if their cultivation level had regressed to nothingness, with no spiritual energy present within them, like mere mortals!
Countless female cultivators gasped in horror, their minds overwhelmed, unable to comprehend what they were witnessing, with the light and shadow becoming unbearably blinding.
The Five Elements Immortal Path, suppressed spiritual energy, and the Immortal Path, radiated countless beams of light!
The spiritual energy in Chen Xun's body completely dissipated, leaving only an empty shell, with the vast Five Elements' Qi filling every meridian.
"The heavenly tribulation... it wasn't striking me, but this Five Elements Golden Core and Five Elements Nascent Soul." Chen Xun's brow furrowed, and he was deeply shocked.
"Damn it, could cultivating the Five Elements Immortal Path be truly defying the heavens?"
The Five Elements give birth to all things, and the Heavenly Path is impartial, granting all beings a chance at life, which is why they exist in the world.
No matter what one does, they are acting per the heavens; it won't interfere.
The so-called "My fate is mine, not the heavens" and "Cultivating immortality is defying the heavens," are nothing more than impotent rage... The Heavenly Path won't care about you at all.
If the Heavenly Path is likened to a human body, the resurgence of spiritual energy is its exhalation, and the subsidence of spiritual energy is its inhalation.
No matter how many cultivators there are, they cannot harm the root of it; they are merely part of the Heavenly Path's breath.
However, the Five Elements' Qi is omnipresent and inexhaustible, like the flesh of the Heavenly Path.
Cultivating this path is like cutting the flesh of the Heavenly Path; even if it can regenerate, the pain during the process will penetrate deep into the bones.
This is why there are Five Element Spiritual Roots instead of Five Elements; everyone should cultivate spiritual energy and not mess with the Five Elements, as it is pointless.
The previous heavenly tribulation had a killing intent. If it weren't for the system's enhancements, forcibly grasping that sliver of life, both Chen Xun and the big black ox would have long perished.
With a series of fortuitous events, the creation of the Five Elements Immortal Path has become inevitable.
_No way!_
_Impossible, absolutely impossible!_
Chen Xun's brows trembled violently, and deep within his heart came a fierce and piercing scream: Heaven, please protect me!!!
**Buzz!**
The light and shadow of the five heads and ten arms seemed to be merging into one, with the endless Five Elements' Qi already filling the Nascent Soul.
**Crack...**
A cracking sound echoed from the void, and Chen Xun's veins bulged as he felt a shudder deep in his soul; a spiritual root had broken.
The Fire entwined around him continued to transform into Five Elements Fire, with Chen Xun trembling violently, feeling the pain that pierced his soul.
At this moment, the system's defenses silently began to operate, helping Chen Xun resist the pain of the broken spiritual root.
"Even if the path to immortality might be severed, as long as I don't die, there will always be another chance."
Chen Xun's expression was wild, his heart fearless and dauntless. Missing this opportunity would be regret for life; nothing feels more wonderful than exploring the unknown.
He was now completely engulfed in a blaze of fire, with the light and shadow behind him closing their eyes, resplendent and dazzling.
"Moo~~~~" The big black ox's eyes widened, staring intently at Chen Xun, sensing a mortal danger.
Chen Xun might be undergoing a great crisis, but it didn't know what it was, only growing more worried.
Half a day later, Chen Xun's Five Elements Spiritual Roots completely shattered, the path to immortality severed, and every inch of his skin oozed blood—gruesome and terrifying.
However, the light and shadow behind him grew smaller and smaller, no longer that towering figure, but instead became more solid, no longer emitting any pressure.
Chen Xun's body was filled with decay, still showing no signs of awakening, as if lost in the Five Elements. If he doesn't wake up, he may never wake up.
The big black ox remained motionless, guarding Chen Xun from a distance, lowly mooing, its eyes filled with pain.
Half a month later.
The light and shadow behind Chen Xun suddenly moved, the five heads turning, the ten arms rotating, exuding only majesty, without the overwhelming force brought by spiritual energy.
Five Nascent Soul phantoms sat atop Chen Xun's head, and a wisp of breath quietly dissipated.
**Boom!**
A rumble echoed from deep underground, like a howl from ancient times, startling the big black ox into a leap.
It instantly activated its spiritual energy shield, layering formations, preparing the incense burner, and getting ready to perform rituals!
