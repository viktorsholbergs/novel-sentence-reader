Trap
* * *
<<<A trap…!? >>>
<<<That’s right, that’s right! You young fool were nothing more than a dancing puppet on the palm of my fin! Guhoho!!>>>
Kobdalian glared at Kobdarok, emitting intense 【Intimidation】.
But Kobdarok brushed aside his 【Intimidation】 as if it were a gentle breeze, and narrowed his eyes with a smirk.
<<<The only reason you were able to safely reach this Humidafai excavation site is because I wanted you to! Didn’t you find it strange? That the valley guards were so weak! They were all expendable, good-for-nothing weaklings! Guhoho!!>>>
<<<Guhohohohoーーー!!>>>
At that moment, mimicking Kobdarok’s laughter, all the surrounding Black Kobu warriors burst into laughter!
<<<You bastaaards…!!>>>
The Black Kobu Tribe, mocking and using their own comrades as pawns!
Seeing that, Kobdalian and the other Red Kobu were outraged, consumed by anger!
<<<Ooh, scary, scary! Don’t get so red in the face! Hmm? Were you already red? Guhoho!>>>
But even facing the full brunt of the Red Kobu warriors’ anger, Kobdarok remained completely unfazed!
He’s sometimes called a ‘ruthless schemer’, but he’s definitely not all talk.
The true nature of this Kobudai, Kobdarok… is that of a first-class warrior, who fights using his giant body and power to the fullest.
His courage, honed through countless battles, is extraordinary…!
<<<That’s right, young one, I’ll show you something interesting… Hey!!>>>
<<<H-Hah!!>>>
Kobdarok then gave some instructions to the Black Kobu warriors, using his chin.
They brought something from behind, carrying it in baskets made by weaving berry vines… and dumped it in front of Kobdalian and the others.
…It was the Red Kobu warriors from the diversionary unit… still alive, but their fins had been torn off… making them unable to move…!
<<<Y-Y-You… BASTAAAAAAAAAARD!!>>>
Now those Red Kobu warriors can’t even swim freely!
What a cruel thing to do!?
Kobdalian couldn’t hold back any longer!
Fierce anger fueled his fighting spirit, and mana overflowed from his body, transforming into flames!
<<<I won’t forgive you, Kobdaroooock!!>>>
Kobdalian, transformed into a demon Kobudai, clad in blazing flames, charged towards Kobdarok in anger!
But!!
Slash.
A sound like that…
And along with that sound, his armor of flames was torn apart by something cold and sharp…
Before he could even start swimming towards Kobdarok… Kobdalian…
Was cut…
By someone…
His scales… no, his body was deeply slashed, leaving a large wound…
Whoosh… whoosh…
The flames emanating from Kobdalian vanished in an instant.
And then… thump…
He fell to the ground.
<<<G-Nuuuh…>>>
But he’s not dead.
Enduring the pain, he desperately tried to create flames again, burning the wound as he thrashed around, trying to identify his attacker.
<<<Hmm… it was a sneak attack… but it seems my supernatural ability, 【Water Claws】, can pierce through your 【Raging Flames】.>>>
<<<Wha!? >>>
And the moment he saw the figure of the attacker…
The moment he heard the attacker’s voice…
Kobdalian was so surprised that he opened his mouth wide and was speechless!
Because standing there…!
The attacker’s true identity…!
…Is a Blue-scaled Kobudai… with three sharp claws made of water extending from the tips of each of his pectoral fins!
In other words!
…It was ‘Kobdacleva, the Wise’… the Clan Chief of the Blue Kobu Tribe!!
<<<Kobda… cleva!?>>>
Kobdalian, swaying unsteadily in the air, faced the Kobudai who was supposed to be his ally, now emitting intense killing intent.
At the same time, he glanced around.
At the bottom of the giant hole, the battle had begun.
The Black Kobu warriors were attacking the outnumbered Red Kobu warriors.
Not only that… even the Blue Kobu warriors, who had marched alongside them…
…Were attacking them.
<<<You betrayed us… No, you set us up!? Why!? >>>
<<<Ha! ‘Why’, you ask? >>>
Kobdacleva scoffed at the flustered Kobdalian…
<<<If I may speak… as the ‘Clan Chief’…>>>
…He began to speak, calmly.
<<<If we calmly analyzed our strength, we would quickly realize that we couldn’t defeat the Black Kobu Tribe, even if we joined forces with the Red Kobu Tribe. So the wise choice is to submit to the Black Kobu Tribe. That’s the reason.>>>
And after saying that, Kobdacleva extended his 【Water Claws】.
And pointed his hump straight at Kobdalian.
He had assumed a battle stance.
<<<And furthermore… if I may speak… as an individual, ‘Kobdalian, the Wise’…>>> (TL Note: I think the author meant to type Kobdacleva here?)
Kobdacleva then continued, this time spitting out the words…
<<<This is revenge, Kobdalian-dono… >>>
And then, this Kobudai, glaring at Kobdalian with eyes filled with hatred…!
<<<My… revenge… on youuuuuuuーーー!!>>>
…Charged at Kobdalian!!
