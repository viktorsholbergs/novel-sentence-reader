Madam Dou was now in her forties, but having cultivated for many years and taken good care of herself, she looked to be just in her thirties. Her jade-like nails were dyed with balsam, exuding an air of elegance and dignity. She walked gracefully into the hall as Li Yuanping quickly came down to greet her with a smile.
"Mother, how rare of you to visit."
Madam Dou nodded gently and sat down beside him. She glanced at Dou Yi, who was trying hard to minimize his presence, and then said to Li Yuanping, "Managing the household is not an easy task. Have you met with the branch family members?"
"Of course I have," Li Yuanping responded. "Li Qiuyang is out, so I sought out Li Xiewen. He just left before you arrived, Mother," he added.
Madam Dou picked up a teacup and, upon hearing Li Xiewen's name, sneered.
"When Li Xiewen served under your father, he was loyal and never interacted with the branch families. After Li Pingyi died, the old man knew he had no way out and immediately aligned himself with the branch families. Over the past few years, he has become a representative of their interests... It seems that Li Yesheng has taught him well. His ability to switch sides and play both ends against the middle is impressive!"
Madam Dou was known for her harsh methods and sharp tongue. With just a few words, she had thoroughly criticized the man. Li Yuanping, naturally aware of the intricacies involved, had specifically sought out Li Xiewen to understand the opinions of the family elders from the branch families.
He replied, "Li Xiewen has offended many people with all he has done. He does not want to rely on us remembering old ties, so he naturally needs to change his position and find a way to survive..."
Madam Dou, however, was much tougher and more stubborn. She simply commented, "I just cannot stand that old scoundrel!"
Both mother and son exchanged a glance. Li Yuanping took a sip of tea and replied, "The Liu Family used to be friendly with our branch families, but they were undermined by the Dou Family, and most of the clan's businesses and properties have been taken over by the Dou Family. According to the branch families, the rise of the Dou Family has threatened their interests, which has caused much dissatisfaction. Li Xiewen's words were barbed, and his insinuations were clear."
"The Ye and Li branch families now number in the thousands, with many cultivators among them. They are related by marriage, making it difficult to manage. Mother, you might need to rein in the Dou Family a little," he added.
Madam Dou rubbed the jade cup in her hand and glared fiercely at Dou Yi, scaring him into silence. She replied, "I have always kept them in check. Otherwise, the Dou Family's arrogance would have soared to the heavens by now. I just fear that with your father away, these family elders will bully us."
Li Yuanping chuckled softly and replied, "Eldest brother is still at Mount Wutu, and the old ancestor is at Mount Lijing. Where would they get the courage to act out? They are just using him to make some noise. The last words of the old ancestor's wife were for us to not shelter the Liu Family. They cannot figure out what the old ancestor is thinking and do not dare to speak out."
He paused, then continued, "From Li Xiewen's words, it seems the Chen Family is friendly with the branch families… Chen Mufeng, a disciple of Li Qiuyang, is exceptionally talented and has been engaged since childhood. He is a rare genius, reaching the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm at seventeen; perhaps we could recall him from Mount Huaqian for use."
Madam Dou nodded absentmindedly, then looked up with some confusion and said, "The Chen Family... Are they really from a farming background? It is already remarkable that Chen Donghe reached the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and now there is Chen Mufeng, who is not even directly related to Chen Donghe, yet managed to cultivate to the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm with such a poor cultivation technique!"
Li Yuanping shook his head and replied, "I have investigated. The Chen Family's founder, named Chen Erniu, was originally our tenant, having fled from the Lichuankou Village during a disaster. Their background is indeed that of a farming family, but judging by the family historical records, this person was quite shrewd..."
Madam Dou nodded, scrutinizing Li Yuanping's pale complexion, her brows furrowing with worry. She spoke gently, "Ping'er, there is one matter that needs to be addressed promptly."
Li Yuanping frowned and looked at his mother in confusion. Madam Dou then continued softly, "You should marry early and have children... This is not just my idea. I have written to Cloud Crowned Peak, and your father shares this sentiment."
The death of Li Yuanxiu had been a profound lesson for Li Xuanxuan and his wife. Considering Li Yuanping's frail health, Madam Dou and Li Xuanxuan began planning early. However, upon hearing this, Li Yuanping was taken aback, his expression turning somewhat sour as he responded, "Brother was engaged at eighteen, and I am only twelve. Why such urgency?!"
Madam Dou's thoughts were harsh and she could not voice them out loud, so she forced a smile. Seeing his mother's expression, Li Yuanping immediately understood and continued saying glumly, "Is it because you're worried that I might die young due to my lack of cultivation talent and weak root bone…?"
Madam Dou fell silent upon hearing this. She had a strong personality and could not bring herself to utter comforting words. The mother and son exchanged a glance once more. Li Yuanping suppressed his emotions and said, "There are many family affairs to handle, including dealing with deficits and external relations. Let us postpone this matter for now."
Madam Dou did not wish to press on too hard and agreed, sitting in the hall for a while longer before finally finding an excuse to leave. Li Yuanping escorted her out of the hall respectfully and then returned to his seat in silence.
The hall was cold and quiet, with guards standing silently on either side. Dou Yi kept his head down and did not speak. Li Yuanping raised his head and lifted the jade cup, looking into the clear tea water. He saw a pale, bloodless face with lips of a grayish-red hue. He squinted his eyes and remained silent for a long time.
Though Li Yuanping had been diligent since childhood and often had long talks with Li Yuanjiao, making him more mature than other boys his age, he was still only twelve or thirteen at the end of the day. Being born with a shortened lifespan and weakened root bone, how could he not feel that life was unfair? Usually, he pretended not to care, but Madam Dou's words earlier had stirred up his suppressed anger now that he was alone.
He put down the jade cup and looked at his wrists that were as slender as a woman's, feeling a surge of rage burning in his chest. He extended his delicate fingers and pinched his wrist hard.
His skin, as pale and lifeless as a corpse's, took a long time to turn red before quickly turning purple and black. It was not long until it finally tore, blood slowly seeping out and staining the desk red. Li Yuanping shook his hand gloomily, gradually calming down.
Li Yuanping had heard that when he was born, the ancestor, Li Tongya, had predicted his cognital deficiencies, slow cultivation progress, and that his lifespan would be barely half that of others.
Calculating the days, a quarter of his life has already passed. He dared not waste any more time and quickly wiped away the blood on the desk before picking up the vermilion brush, and silently wrote:
"Dear brother... I am of age to marry and bear children. Are there any suitable matches among the prominent families or towns with a spiritual orifice? If there are, please inform me..."
Folding the letter, Li Yuanping called out, "Someone, come!"
A person came forward hurriedly and looked up at Li Yuanping expectantly—it was a member of the Liu Family. He had been squeezed out of his position by the Dou Family but was personally reinstated by Li Yuanping, so his eyes were full of gratitude.
"Deliver this to my elder brother at Mount Wutu," Li Yuanping ordered.
