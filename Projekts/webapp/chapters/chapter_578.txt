The water ape's fur rippled as it came to a sudden realization, its thoughts abruptly clearing, "No wonder a mere minor cultivator was able to steal my treasure… I thought he was just some ignorant child from a family clan… But it turns out he is tied to a thread of fate. From the moment I resolved to retrieve the treasure, I had already set foot on a path to death."
The water ape's bloodline was unique. It had started its life guarding the gates of the Water Mansion and later took up responsibility for overseeing a section of the sea. Yet, it had always been nostalgic for its former master. Now, faced with this situation, it thought bitterly, The master can't even protect me, so he must be in dire straits… And I deserve this misfortune. Blinded as I was, I failed to see that the thief was someone tied to fate. Well, so be it, so be it…
It concealed its form and darted swiftly through the seawater. Li Xuanfeng, anticipating this tactic, showed no sign of haste. Calmly, he brushed his waist, and a palm-sized blue mirror flew out. It was the Glimmering Inquiry Mirror.
Blue light streamed from the mirror's surface, sweeping across the waves. This time, it moved much faster than when searching for Zhong Qian, quickly illuminating a blue tail flame in the water. Li Xuanfeng nocked another arrow and drew his bow, This demon has lost its will to fight… It has figured things out… Such a waste for someone with late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation to die here.
The water ape, just a li away, felt a chill run through its body, its gray-white fur bristling. It wasn't surprised and spat out a few more mercury-jade tokens, which began to orbit protectively around its body.
This man reeks of killing intent. His hands must have ended many demons. He's one of those weapons wielded by the Daoist Masters. I… Its ears buzzed as another streak of golden light pierced through the air and struck its body, only to vanish into the distant horizon. Intense pain spread through its torso. The water ape let out a deafening roar, enduring the agony as it fled aimlessly across the sea.
Flying several li on the wind, it sensed its Immortal Foundation trembling, and realization dawned, I'm under some kind of spell!
Though it hadn't fought Li Xuanfeng head-on for long, the ape had already lost its footing, overtaken by deep panic. It lacked even the courage to turn back and fight, leaving it paralyzed by its own fear. Realizing this, its heart sank.
Yet, just as it came to this understanding, another golden arrow streaked through the air, shattering another mercury-jade token into shards of radiant light scattered across the sky.
In the brief moment after the arrow struck, the water ape seized the opportunity to form hand seals, summoning streams of grayish-white light. Complex patterns interwove, forming triangular and pentagonal shapes inscribed with runic text.
"Treasure Talisman White Inquiry Technique!" The ape's cultivation of the Secret White Mercury was an ancient Immortal Foundation technique, rooted in the Whole Pill essence and specializing in spellcraft. Once the inquiry spell was activated, the three remaining mercury-jade tokens floated upward and pointed toward a single direction.
The water ape rode the waves, heading in that direction with determination. The wound on its abdomen squirmed and slowly closed, as the Secret White Mercury technique granted it robust physical regeneration. Though it had been struck by multiple arrows, the injuries were less severe than they appeared. Immersed in the sea, its breathing and movements continuously healed its wounds.
It traveled swiftly over the waves and, after enduring another arrow, finally located the golden-armored figure amid the stormy seas and oppressive clouds.
The figure in black-gold armor was dazzling even in the pouring rain. A helmet covered his face, concealing his features entirely.
The water ape did not waste words. Instead, it charged forward in silence, its hands rapidly expanding in size until they were as large as doors, reaching out to grab the armored figure.
Li Xuanfeng, seeing the water ape coming for him, nodded slightly. The demon, despite its many spells and balanced capabilities, lacked significant weaknesses, making it difficult to kill outright. He watched the attack approach, calm and unhurried, lightly adjusting the lower corner of his longbow.
The water ape noticed the lack of evasive action and felt a chill run down its spine. He must have something up his sleeve… But no matter what, I can't let him keep firing those arrows!
Gritting its teeth, it pressed forward, silver-white light emanating from its palms, a clear sign of Immortal Foundation techniques bolstered by spellcraft. Li Xuanfeng, completely unfazed, let his black-gold armor flare with radiant light as he punched straight into the water ape's enormous palm.
Boom!
A thunderous explosion echoed across the sky, ricocheting through the dark clouds. Li Xuanfeng met the attack head-on, retreating only half a step before pulling back and swinging his longbow forcefully toward the water ape's head.
The water ape, stunned that its blow had been matched, faltered for a moment, its thoughts in disarray, What kind of Immortal Foundation is this? Such immense strength… Or is he not even human? Could he be some sort of demon himself…
Though the ape was inexperienced in close combat, it was still a demon. It hesitated briefly, but a silvery-white shield appeared over its face. However, the heavy strike from Li Xuanfeng's bow shattered the shield with a deafening crash, sending the ape plummeting into the sea. The shimmering shield flickered briefly before disintegrating entirely.
Buzz…
Before it could recover, another streak of golden light hurtled toward it. The water ape let out a mournful cry as yet another mercury-jade token exploded into fragments, forcing it to cough up a mouthful of silvery blood.
The water ape broke through the surface of the ocean, its remaining eye narrowing as it spotted the distant golden figure of Li Xuanfeng, who appeared like a shimmering speck of gold. The great bow in his hands unfurled like massive golden wings, another brilliant streak of light already aimed and heading its way.
Despair gripped the water ape's heart. It cursed inwardly, If only the Celestial Screen of Azure Patterns hadn't been taken by that wretched brat, I wouldn't be in this pitiful state… not even a single defensive artifact left to my name.
In the brief skirmish, the water ape realized the sheer precision of this man's archery, seamlessly combined with his artifacts, techniques, and spells. It was a combination that seemed almost unbeatable. Without sufficient defensive artifacts, incredible speed to flee far beyond his range, or a secure cave dwelling to hide in, the ape knew it was doomed to a slow and inevitable death.
Gritting its teeth, the ape flew through the air, heading toward the golden figure. Two remaining mercury-jade tokens hovered protectively before it, as its hands formed intricate gestures. Around it, the seawater began to condense into orbs resembling jade beads.
"Treasure Talisman Horizon Escape Technique…" Realizing that fighting was futile and running would only prolong its suffering, the ape resorted to its escape technique. Its massive, fan-like palms came together as it cast the spell. From the distance, Li Xuanfeng noticed the ape's actions and smoothly drew his bowstring.
Hum hum hum…
A piercing hum filled the air, growing in intensity. The water ape's ears began to bleed from the sound as a streak of golden light shot toward it like a blazing comet.
"Damn it!" A brilliant explosion of golden light erupted before the ape, scattering its protective jade tokens. The radiant energy disrupted its spells, leaving its defenses entangled in the oppressive clear light. Five more streaks of golden light swiftly followed, converging upon it.
A deafening roar shook the heavens. The ocean surface erupted in a towering white geyser, silver mercury droplets intermingling with the spray. Black-blue steam hissed as it evaporated, creating a cacophony of crackling sounds.
"Arrrrghh!" The ape's remaining jade tokens shattered under the relentless assault, leaving it grievously injured. Its internal organs felt as if they had been torn apart, its limbs splintering like shattered glass before dissolving into fragments under the intense radiance.
Crash.
