"The hunt your race is currently enduring is no coincidence; they want to exterminate you..." Chen Xun let out a deep smile, half of his face still shrouded in shadow. "Little Red, you’re definitely going to die. I’m afraid you've long been targeted—just waiting to be harvested!"
"Ah!!! Brother Ox, save me!"
"Moo~~!"
The ox and lion were so terrified that their scalps tingled. They stood up and hugged each other, Chen Xun's expression far too sinister—definitely not that of a good person.
A large cloud passed overhead, and the entire flying boat suddenly cleared up. Chen Xun resumed his bright smile.
"Breaking through the original limit of spiritual consciousness can quickly lead to a breakthrough?" Chen Xun raised an eyebrow, having observed Little Red's spiritual consciousness with his divine sense. "So, to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, one must primarily focus on refining spiritual consciousness?"
The "God-killing Stones" they used could only enhance the power of destruction but couldn’t strengthen spiritual consciousness—they lacked that natural characteristic.
"That’s right, Brother Xun. Back in the day, I had to use my spiritual sense to solidify things just to survive by stealing. It’s widely acknowledged among both humans and spirit beasts that the easiest way to break through to the Nascent Soul stage is to push the limits of spiritual consciousness." Little Red began to talk non-stop, its bloodline memories containing some knowledge. "But the heart-demon tribulation will be even more terrifying."
Hearing this, Chen Xun and the big black ox's aura grew sharper. So, this is where the heart-refining tribulation during the Nascent Soul stage and the memory traps come in.
The path of cultivation is indeed marked with blood at every step. Who knows how many have perished along the way? There's no shortcut when breaking through.
The big black ox’s eyes bulged like copper bells—he had certainly learned something new. This Little Red knew quite a bit.
"Hahaha..."
Chen Xun suddenly laughed aloud. "I remember the place we were back then—it was the edge of the Tian Duan Plain, right? At most, we only saw Foundation Establishment-level spirit beasts."
"Hehe, yeah," Little Red responded with an awkward smile. "That’s actually where I used to wander—no Nascent Soul-level beasts held territory there."
"So, it seems that your experiences and ours leading to this encounter were inevitable, not just a coincidence." Chen Xun sat down cross-legged, his voice as gentle as a spring breeze. "This is fate, something you can't escape. I act according to my whims, Little Red. I think highly of you."
As he finished speaking, a transcendent and ethereal aura slowly began to rise from Chen Xun, leaving Little Red dumbfounded.
The big black ox stared at Chen Xun with wide eyes but didn’t stop what he was doing. He was already preparing to pull out an incense burner to worship his eldest brother.
"Moo?"
"Brother Xun?"
"Little Red, how do you plan to raise your cultivation?" Chen Xun’s gaze sharpened. Spirit beasts and humans were constructed differently, and the old ox was an exception. "It’s no small feat to break through to the Nascent Soul stage."
"Well..." Little Red lay on the ground, a lecherous glint almost spilling out of its eyes. "Brother Xun, I steal spiritual herbs to eat, and sometimes I can digest a few spirit stones."
"Moo!" The big black ox was overjoyed. Spiritual herbs were its specialty—it could even cultivate new species.
Little Red looked at the big black ox in confusion. Why did Brother Ox’s gaze seem so strange? It was true that it stole from other houses during inter-clan battles.
"Do you know the key elements of robbery in the cultivation world?"
Chen Xun looked up at the sky with a boastful tone, explaining, "Old Ox sets up formations, I keep watch, Little Red steals, and Little Crane drives the boat for escape!"
"Moo~~~"
"Roar~~~~"
The Blazing Red Lion felt enlightened. So, it was Brother Ox who set up the formations. "Brother Xun, isn’t robbery a bit improper? We’ll offend too many cultivators."
"Of course, such things require careful planning. We can't be careless." Chen Xun nodded approvingly at Little Red, then patted the big black ox. "Old Ox, tell Little Red about our past experiences."
"Moo~~~!" The big black ox snorted out a hot breath, now thoroughly energized.
The Blazing Red Lion was utterly confused by this.
Soon after, the big black ox pulled Little Red aside and took out a small booklet, recounting their past experiences in the eastern nations, along with some stories from before.
The Blazing Red Lion occasionally let out shocked roars. Brother Xun and Brother Ox were indeed 'kindred spirits'!
Buzz—
Buzz—
The giant boat sped across the sky, and the atmosphere inside was lively. The horizon echoed with laughter and conversation, full of mutual understanding.
"Little Red, we're heading to The Great Li Realm."
"Moo!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox slowly rose, an unspoken aura gradually radiating from them.
Little Red couldn’t help but take a few steps back, his lips dry and tongue-tied. "Brother Xun, Brother Ox, I understand."
"Back then, I didn’t realize you’d had such experiences, but if you regret it now... it's too late!"
"Moo?!"
"What?!"
"Hahaha..."
Chen Xun laughed maniacally, clearly amused by Little Red’s timid expression. "Don’t worry, as long as we have food, you won’t starve. Come with us and see the world."
In two thousand years of cultivation, Chen Xun and the big black ox had met many people. Running into Little Red was truly fate, and with their current abilities, there was no way they would let him perish right in front of them.
"Brother Xun, I truly believe that!"
"Moo?"
"Brother Ox, I can sense it—you two have no malice or killing intent. You’re nothing like those profit-driven cultivators." Little Red took a deep breath, his emotions surging. "Since I’ve stepped onto this boat with you two, I, the Beigong Red Lion, will never regret it!"
"Good lad."
"Moo~~~"
"Brother Xun, Brother Ox, there’s something I’d like to say, though I’m not sure if I should."
"Speak."
"Moo!"
"Nascent Soul-level spirit beasts can never be used as mounts. They have their own pride and would rather die than submit." Little Red took a few steps closer, sweat beading on his forehead. "Brother Xun, the idea you mentioned the other day—'as many as we want'—is a very dangerous plan. They would self-destruct."
"Hmm..." Chen Xun turned away, his hands behind his back, gazing upward with a profound look. "Little Red, you make a good point."
"Moo~~~" The big black ox nodded in agreement. He thought it made sense. There were many beings in the world unafraid of death, and not everything could be decided by cultivation level alone.
"Brother Xun, those Nascent Soul mounts are all trained from the Foundation Establishment stage to be truly loyal." Little Red chuckled awkwardly again, genuinely worried that the two brothers might attempt to capture Nascent Soul-level mounts, which would be extremely dangerous. "Brother Xun, I’m just giving a little reminder, nothing more."
"Very well."
"Brother Xun, Brother Ox, one more thing." Little Red glanced around the giant boat. They were getting farther and farther from the Tian Duan Plains. "I think it might be better if we turn back to the Tian Duan Plai—"
Before he could finish speaking, Chen Xun grabbed him and shouted:
"Damn it, Old Ox, beat him up!"
"Moo moo!"
"Ah~~~!!!"
From the skies came sounds of beating and wretched screams from a flickering giant boat. The divine tree aboard shone a bit brighter from the commotion.
Two years later...
The boat had passed the frontiers of The Great Li Realm, not as far as the cultivator world of Qian Nation.
By now, Little Red had grown close with Chen Xun and the big black ox, rarely leaving their side, fearful they’d abandon him along the way.
There was no turning back now. The surroundings were unfamiliar, and if they left him behind, he would surely die!
Chen Xun even crafted a magic item for him to wear, which could block divine sense detection. Little Red accepted it with tears of gratitude, and when he put it on, a flash of red light concealed it within his fur.
Over the past two years, Chen Xun has been secretly observing Little Red. Even though they had God-killing Stones and spiritual herbs, he never asked for anything. His temperament was indeed commendable, similar to theirs—not greedy.
