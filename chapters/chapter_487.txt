Meng Taizhi shook his head helplessly and replied with a wry smile, "Of course, I have approached them, which is why I had the opportunity to come to the lake. But what can a minor connection from hundreds of years ago do? I can't even step into the threshold of the immortal clan."
Li Yuanping stared at him and nodded.
"Since you have entrusted the legacy to me, you may send your daughter up the mountain, old man. I will contact the Xiao Family."
"Thank you! Thank you, Family Head!"
Meng Taizhi felt relief wash over him as he smiled in gratitude, then hurriedly retreated. Li Yuanping then called over Li Xicheng and said, "Have Ximing write a letter to Senior Yuansi to inquire if this is true. If it is, take this legacy."
Li Xicheng hesitated for a moment, looking concerned.
"But Brother Ming... is easily swayed by beauty... If he develops feelings for this woman from the Meng Family... It could lead to trouble, especially if these people from the Meng Family had kept their troubled past a secret from us."
"Let's not worry about this first and confirm with Senior Yuansi. As long as this person's explanation is correct, then all is well. Meng Zhuoyun is naturally not a problem, and she will leave in a few years," Li Yuanping replied.
Li Xicheng hesitated and said, "I'm only worried that when the time comes, Brother Ming will be reluctant to let her go and will want to keep her..."
Li Yuanping sneered and replied, "What kind of feelings can this bastard have? He is extremely heartless. He had fooled around with several girls in the Xiao Family and might have even left a few children behind… Do you think he ever cared? He has many concubines, but have you ever seen him say a word to any of them?"
He shook his head and concluded, "The most important thing in that kid's heart is his own dao. Women are merely a pastime. Everything else must take a backseat to his ambitions... After raising him for so many years, I know him well."
Li Yuanping coughed twice and bent down in pain. Li Xicheng hurried to support him, channeling some true essence into him. After a moment of rest, Li Yuanping slowly recovered.
He then said calmly, "Let him do what he wants. That girl from the Meng Family can't have an heir anyway. Whether they are close or involved in an affair, let him do as he wishes. When the time is right, let that girl leave."
Li Yuanping looked calm as he spoke with a fatherly certainty.
"He is more heartless than anyone else and will not hesitate to cut ties."
Li Yuanjiao had always been cautious while riding the wind. Wrapped in the spirit mist and blessed by Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit, he moved with remarkable speed.
The greatest benefit of Li Yuanjiao's Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit was the increase in his cultivation speed. Although he had never matched Li Qinghong's rapid progress since childhood, this talisman had allowed him to catch up significantly.
Xijun… really trusts this monk, huh?
As he flew amidst the mist, Li Yuanjiao was preoccupied with his own thoughts.
He had inquired extensively with the Xiao Family about Kongheng and had also spoken privately with several fellow Daoists. In ancient times, there was a saying among Buddhist cultivators about overcoming tribulations; if several Mahas from the north were to incarnate, it would not escape the immortal mirror's notice.
Despite this knowledge, Li Yuanjiao still felt a flicker of anger though he was only acting. It was not directed at Kongheng, but rather at Li Xijun's insistence on protecting the monk.
Your grandfather and great-grandfather died at the hands of a Buddhist cultivator! How could you protect a Buddhist cultivator like this?!
Li Yuanjiao understood what kind of person Kongheng was, but Li Xijun's actions were still difficult for him to fully accept. With a sigh, he landed on the Mushroom Forest Plain.
The Mushroom Forest Plain has fertile soil, and was lush with green forests. Beyond the trees, dark peaks loomed on all sides, dotted with caves of various sizes.
The ores in these mountains were purple and black and were faintly crackling with energy, and thunder struck down from time to time, creating violent roars. A protective formation surrounded the mountain, and Li Qinghong must be among them.
As Li Yuanjiao landed at the foot of the mountain, a man hurried over. The Qi Cultivator, appearing slightly nervous, said respectfully, "Senior, this is my Yuan Family's territory… How may I assist you?"
Li Yuanjiao waved his sleeve and replied solemnly, "I am Li Yuanjiao of Qingdu."
The Qi Cultivator from the Yuan Family immediately understood and said, "Please proceed up the mountain, Senior. Senior Wushao is in the yard."
Li Yuanjiao nodded and flew upward, cloaked in the mysterious spirit mist that concealed his figure. From a distance, he heard a roar.
"Stupid monk, what are you reciting again?"
The corner of Li Yuanjiao's mouth twitched slightly. Li Wushao typically appeared fierce and brooding, so it was rare to see him lose his composure like this. Looking up, he spotted a young man in black standing against the courtyard wall with anger etched on his face.
"Fellow Daoist Wushao... this is called Respected Cultivator's Subduing Words. The seven Daos of the north excel at using this sutra to subdue demons. Please listen closely; it will prepare you for the future."
Kongheng stood in the courtyard, bare from the waist up, smiling peacefully as he held a golden light in his hand. Li Yuanjiao was slightly stunned; in less than three years, this person had already become a Master Monk!
Li Wushao gritted his teeth and appeared to be suffering from a terrible headache. Kongheng then remarked in a peaceful tone, "Remember to calm down and concentrate your mind, fellow Daoist… I will teach you a few ways to resist this."
"Fuck you," Li Wushao cursed, but he did not lash out physically. Instead, he listened obediently. Kongheng proceeded to recite hundreds of words, and Li Wushao memorized every single one of them.
"Monk, I've heard that Buddhist cultivators in the north enjoy capturing and taming demonic creatures, making them lose their minds… Is that true?" he asked curiously.
"Of course," Kongheng replied as he frowned and continued in a serious tone, "Once controlled by this spell, the affected are not comparable to spiritual beings... They lose themselves and completely transform into what is referred to as a spirit beast."
Li Wushao shook his head, visibly shaken by this piece of information. He then asked further, "Then don't you also want to capture demon creatures?"
"No," Kongheng said firmly, shaking his head, "Spells and techniques are meant to change yourself, not others. Using them to confuse people's minds is an evil Dao and one cannot become a Revered One on that path."
Li Wushao glanced at him, then nodded with a smile.
"You truly are an ancient cultivator. No wonder you say that the River Temple is declining day by day... But it's so difficult to practice and break through. If you have a spell but can't use it, you naturally can't compete with others."
"That's right," Kongheng agreed, appearing unconcerned about his own Dao lineage. He sat cross-legged and remarked thoughtfully, "I hope Xijun won't be in trouble because of me..."
Li Wushao, who was still sitting nearby, offered him some advice.
"If you ask me, since you've just broken through, you might as well return early and avoid causing trouble here. I've already sent news about your breakthrough back."
Kongheng insisted softly, "I'll keep watch here. If anything happens, I can take care of her. I'm a Master Monk and I can deal with a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator by myself."
After hearing this, Li Yuanjiao flew down and revealed himself, startling both Kongheng and Li Wushao. The latter jumped up in surprise and nearly reverted to his true form.
"Wushao greets Master!" he exclaimed.
Stealing a glance at Li Yuanjiao and noticing that he appeared normal, he breathed a sigh of relief. Kongheng looked at him with a hint of unease and replied softly, "This humble monk greets fellow Daoist."
"You are too polite, Master Monk," Li Yuanjiao said calmly.
"Since you have successfully broken through, why not return with me?"
"Sure," Kongheng responded respectfully.
"My temple's secret technique required the activation of the Supreme Void Yin Thunder. I made use of the Profound Thunderpool condensed by Daoist Qinghong while she was establishing her foundation. Since I have already made my breakthrough, I believe Daoist Qinghong will succeed soon as well."
