In these hundred years, they continued to allocate points. It didn't have any effect, so they randomly allocated all of them to spiritual energy.
However, after increasing spiritual energy to ninety, they found that they couldn't allocate points anymore. It seemed to be stuck at a bottleneck. They had no choice but to add points to defense and speed.
At the same time, Chen Xun also discovered that there was a limit to the allocation of points, but after breaking through, it didn't affect anything. Instead, it led to a direct and significant increase in strength.
Their current immortal points are: Strength 50, Speed 71 (50), Essence of All Things 50, Spiritual Energy 90 (50), Defense 90 (50).
During these hundred years, Chen Xun had felled quite a few Crane Spirit Trees and became quite interested in their characteristics, claiming it was for "research."
Because many disciples and senior brothers had inquired whether indiscriminate felling of the trees was a good practice...
Chen Xun naturally wouldn't reveal the hardships of the past when he was impoverished. People always want to maintain their dignity.
Only the big black ox knew about this matter; it was their secret.
He also tried finding a thousand-year Crane Spirit Tree, and he did find one, but not many. It was like a towering, giant tree, and he knocked it out with a punch, causing it to suffer a minor concussion.
After a few years of cultivation, he nurtured it for ten thousand years. Unexpectedly, it didn't reach its limit. Chen Xun angrily punched it again, still giving it a slight concussion.
Continuing the cultivation, pushing it to the limit! Anyway, it wasn't in the soil; he wasn't afraid it would come alive.
After a hundred thousand years, the Crane Spirit Tree finally showed signs of withering, turning black. A sense of death gradually spread throughout the entire Medicine Garden, even beginning to affect the spirit herbs.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were startled. What's happening? Is it mutating?!
Fortunately, they had cultivated to the third level of the Water Spirit Technique, preserving the spirit herbs intact.
As for the wood, Chen Xun shook his head with a smile, saying only one word: "Excellent!"
His current strength couldn't move it at all, and the Opening Mountain Axe couldn't cut it. It was comparable to the Crane Spirit King in the Crane Spirit Tree realm.
The big black ox continuously nourished the tree using the Water Spirit Technique while shielding it from the dead aura. If it were an ordinary Water Spirit Technique, a catastrophe might have occurred.
Chen Xun, on the other hand, was refining tools on the side using the Powder Fire Cutting Method... With the spiritual energy boost, Powder Fire had become a magic weapon in Chen Xun's hands, dedicated to fine work.
Every day, like a master craftsman, he sat on the giant tree, continuously cutting wood with the pale Powder Fire. A black coffin filled with a dense network of thousand-year spirit vine threads was gradually taking shape inside.
The inside of the black coffin was entirely made of threads from the thousand-year Crane Spirit Tree, dense and numerous. If anyone entered, even Chen Xun didn't dare to experience the feeling...
The big black ox also started practicing the method of refining tools, often nourishing them with its blood, just to achieve heart-to-heart communication.
Chen Xun teased him every day: "The big black ox matches the big black coffin, hahaha..."
This angered the big black ox, making it arch Chen Xun several times. This big black coffin was its treasure.
Chen Xun personally made it for him, so he couldn't make fun of it even if he wanted to.
However, Chen Xun silently matched the big black ox with many elixirs every day, for the purpose of restoring its blood essence. This black coffin seemed to have made the big black ox lose some weight.
Chen Xun's Opening Mountain Axe wasn't in a hurry; he hadn't found good materials yet, and the matter of the old ox was more important.
Over these years, his art of refining tools has greatly improved. With the Powder Fire and its "Three Elements Powder," their cultivation had slowly advanced to the later stage of foundation building. After walking a bit further, reaching the perfection realm, they could form a powder.
The quality of the "Three Elements Pill" has also been improved by Chen Xun to the top grade, mainly because he used a considerable amount of high-aged spirit herbs.
Different qualities yield different effects; otherwise, there would be no distinction in quality.
Originally used by mid-foundation-building cultivators, the Ling Pill Hall of the Five Elements Sect could only refine mid-grade and lower-grade "Three Elements Pills."
If it were a top-grade or perfect-grade pill, it would also be useful for late foundation-building cultivators, as Chen Xun and the big black ox personally experienced.
However, Chen Xun lacked confidence in his own pill refining techniques. He relied entirely on the accumulation of the quantity and age of spirit herbs.
Although, according to the normal lifespan of cultivators, they might have already passed away... But their path to the mid-foundation-building stage had gone smoothly.
Because of their longevity, Chen Xun and the big black ox had a very good mentality, steadily advancing their cultivation with a calm and unhurried approach to everything.
Occasionally, Chen Xun would also go to the Pill Refining Hall to inquire about the breakthrough methods for the Golden Elixir stage.
The Five Elements Sect had at least twenty or so cultivators in the Golden Elixir stage; they couldn't all be Heavenly Spirit Roots, right?
But he did learn about the method. It was similar to building the foundation pill; most cultivators in the cultivation world knew about it, just that he didn't.
The gist was to break through the Golden Elixir stage, focusing on perfecting one's spiritual roots and then condensing the Golden Elixir within the body, causing even more phenomena to occur.
Whenever someone in the Five Elements Sect broke through to the Golden Elixir stage, they had to close the mountain. Chen Xun and the big black ox had witnessed it once in so many years.
The scene was astonishing, with faint auroras shining in the sky, as if someone were ascending to immortality... They almost thought they had to perform some rituals.
As for people like them with a mixed spiritual root, they needed to gather the five elemental pills—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—to forcefully break through.
Chen Xun was terrified when he heard about it at first, and these pills needed to be at least mid-grade. Which sect would invest so many resources in someone with a mixed spiritual root?
Most of the cultivators in the Qian Nation who broke through to the Golden Elixir stage had at least two superior spiritual roots.
Those with three superior spiritual roots breaking through were extremely rare, indicating that they had obtained some great opportunities.
But over these hundred years, Chen Xun has accumulated a large number of contributions. He exchanged the prescription for these five elemental pills from the Contribution Hall, and the elders of the Contribution Hall were no longer surprised.
This junior brother was indeed an extraordinary person. Clearly, he had only reached the mid-foundation-building stage, yet sometimes he would dabble in Qi refining period spells, and sometimes he would explore Qi refining period prescriptions. Now, he was even venturing into the Golden Elixir period...
However, the contribution points belonged to others, and this junior brother had always diligently managed the spirit herbs. They couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for Chen Xun.
When Chen Xun returned to the Spirit Herb Garden at that time, he and the big black ox were overjoyed.
Fortunately, there were few cultivators in the Qian Nation who could form a powder, so these rare spirit herbs were not in high demand. They hadn't been picked like the foundation-building spirit herbs, facing extinction.
Over these years, whenever these senior brothers had private matters, they would call on him to help. They had also collected seeds from various spirit herb gardens around the sect for hundreds of years.
All these rare spirit herbs, such as Thunder Bamboo Fruit, Profound True Flower, Jade Marrow Mushroom, etc., had some that required more than eight hundred years to be used as medicine.
The Five Elements Sect cultivated them generation after generation, and when the herbs matured, they sent people to harvest them. Finally, these rare spirit herbs were stored in the Pill Refining Hall for future generations.
These rare spirit herbs and spirit pills couldn't be exchanged in the Contribution Hall, just like advanced-level Golden Elixir stage techniques. The Five Elements Sect didn't open up such things.
Sitting on a giant rock, Chen Xun gradually withdrew his gaze and spoke:
"Old Ox, let's go home and get ready."
"Moo~"
The two of them strolled towards the Spirit Herb Garden, their eyes showing neither joy nor sorrow, only a faint tranquility.
