The Hanging Bamboo Market, located outside the Yuzhu Mountains, is one of the markets of the Five Elements Sect in the outside world and a place where numerous independent cultivators and cultivators from various sects come and go.
However, to enter this market, one must pass through a vast expanse of towering bamboo forests. If a mortal were to enter by mistake, they would only get lost.
As the clear wind sweeps through, the bamboo forest sways gently, emitting a rhythmic sound like a delightful melody drifting in the air.
Upon seeing a figure, independent cultivators and sect cultivators alike display a shocked expression, hastily bowing to make way. The person, however, responds with a smile and is quite amiable, holding a black spiritual beast in hand.
This person is dressed in the gray-blue robe of the Five Elements Sect, undoubtedly a foundational stage cultivator of the Five Elements Sect!
After passing through the bamboo forest, a vast and lively market comes into view, with countless pavilions arranged in an orderly manner. Occasionally, small auctions are held.
Independent cultivators have a wary look in their eyes. Although the market is safe, the outside world is not necessarily so; everyone seems to be in a hurry.
Chen Xun smiles slightly, as if seeing his past self. They seem to have lived a precarious life similar to this before.
"Moo~"
The big black ox looks around. They are now like big brothers, and the feeling is indeed different.
No one dares to look at them with strange eyes anymore, and everyone shows respect in their expressions. The big black ox can't help but wag its tail, feeling quite comfortable.
"Old ox, let's go. He's in the sect's talisman shop."
"Moo!"
The big black ox bellows at Chen Xun. They swagger through the market of the sect, no longer needing to hide.
Shifeng Talisman Shop, where people come and go, is quite prosperous.
But on the edge outside the loft, a middle-aged man is currently reprimanding a few disciples. He keeps talking, making the disciples look quite impatient.
The middle-aged man looks to be in his fifties, already at the tenth level of Qi Refinement, with a righteous face and a tone that carries a sense of impatience with those who are not progressing fast enough.
After a few incense sticks' time, the middle-aged man finally stops lecturing, and the disciples of the Five Elements Sect leave as if escaping, muttering about their bad luck.
The middle-aged man, hands behind his back, shakes his head continually. "Time flies, unexpectedly not seizing the time to cultivate. When you're old, there won't be any more opportunities."
Time passes, leaving behind countless years, taking away countless moments, and only leaving behind a face carved by the years.
"Le Feng." Chen Xun smiles and bows.
The middle-aged man is surprised, looking at Chen Xun standing on the opposite street. He exclaims, "Chen Xun, Martial Uncle!"
This scene is quite strangeâ€”a middle-aged man actually addressing a young teenager as Martial Uncle.
"Come, Martial Uncle, I didn't expect you to break through to the foundational stage. Congratulations!"
Le Feng's face blooms like a chrysanthemum, quickly walking over and pulling Chen Xun's hand and the rope of the big black ox. "Martial Uncle, Black Ox, come in quickly."
"Hey, slow down!"
"Moo!!"
They are forcibly dragged by Le Feng, just like the day they arrived at the Five Elements Sect. This senior brother has always been so enthusiastic.
In the backyard, Chen Xun sits on a stone stool, while Le Feng stands on the side, bowing and not daring to sit.
"Le Feng, sit quickly."
"Yes, Martial Uncle." Le Feng's voice carries a hint of hoarseness.
The two sit facing each other, with a slight sense of nostalgia and joy on their faces.
"Le Feng, why did you descend the mountain so early? You still have many good years ahead, and I believe you have the potential to reach the foundational stage."
Chen Xun asks in confusion, not seeing any signs of Le Feng being disheartened.
"Martial Uncle, you may not know, but the Enforcement Hall has an age requirement for Qi Refinement disciples, not exceeding fifty."
"Even so, you could continue cultivating in other halls."
"Hehe, Martial Uncle, that's not my aspiration."
Le Feng shakes his head lightly and says seriously, "I only have a four-element lower spiritual root. Master found me on the mountain below and raised me, nurturing me to grow up in the Five Elements Sect."
"My prowess in battles is not strong, and I can't even enter the top five thousand in the sect's grand competition sequence. If I stay within the sect all the time, it would be a waste of cultivation resources."
"As for the foundational stage, it was never something I considered. Encouraging junior brothers and sisters to cultivate well is my greatest wish."
Le Feng laughs generously, looking at Chen Xun with nothing but contentment in his eyes. "Being able to see Junior Brother Chen Xun, who was once like me, reaching the foundational stage, I am already very satisfied."
Chen Xun's words seem to be stuck in his throat. He feels that whatever he says now seems feeble and inadequate. People like Le Feng are truly different.
"On the contrary, I feel relieved to see the former Senior Brother Le Feng in such a state of mind. I can rest easy now." Chen Xun smiles warmly.
"Martial Uncle, you don't need to worry. Not all cultivators are seeking longevity, and I have no regrets either."
"Hehe, in one's life, you may encounter many people or experience many things, but as long as you can extract wisdom from them, it is enough."
Chen Xun suddenly bows, making a congratulatory gesture. "It seems Senior Brother Le Feng has found what he was looking for. Congratulations."
"Hahaha..."
The two suddenly burst into laughter, leaving the big black ox bewildered. What are you guys blabbering about?
Quietly strolling, dust and worldly matters are like clouds of smoke.
The two walk slowly in the backyard, constantly discussing the past. Unconsciously, their minds become open and carefree. Chen Xun is exceptionally patient this time, listening to Le Feng's chatter. After a while, Chen Xun and the big black ox bid farewell.
"Martial Uncle, Black Ox, time flies, don't get lost in worldly pleasures again. Treasure your time and cultivate well!" Le Feng shouts at their retreating figures, with a hint of urgency on his face.
Chen Xun turns around gracefully, arching his hand and laughing loudly. "Chen Xun will remember!"
"Moo~~!" The big black ox also turns back and lets out a bellow. It remembers too.
The two leave the market, and Le Feng watches their disappearing figures for a long time. Finally, he sighs gently and returns to the talisman shop to prepare to randomly select a lucky person.
Now, with Martial Uncle Chen Xun as an example, he believes that none of those young disciples would dare to waste their time and not cultivate properly.
...
Chen Xun and the big black ox return to the Spirit Medicine Garden, diligently planting spiritual herbs. Every day, they observe the Floating Light Mysterious Array; they have no time for anything else.
Raising mountain chickens, wild boars, and reading "Basic Geniuses and Earth Treasures Encyclopedia" daily, they find everything inside extremely tempting. What is this Geng Metal, which can enhance the sharpness of tools during refining? What about the Eight Treasures Scarlet Gold, which can increase the harmony between internal mana and magical tools, greatly enhancing their power?
There is also the Profound Ice Jade Liquid, which can be used to cultivate eye power, with the effect of dispelling illusions and even seeing through some restrictions directly.
And then there is something called Mirage True Stone Milk, which makes the big black ox drool. This thing can actually be used for body refinement. If it's used to refine its horns, wouldn't it be invincible, unbreakable by anyone?
The man and the ox are sitting on the hill in the medicine garden, overlooking the grassland.
"Old ox, this is incredible. Our knowledge has expanded so much. I never knew there were so many rare items in the cultivation world."
Chen Xun sighs in amazement, pointing continuously at things in the books, and the big black ox is also fascinated. And this is just the most basic.
Chen Xun finally understands that this Iron Essence is only the lowest-level material for refining magical tools, and his path with the mountain opening axe is still long.
They are immersed in it, sometimes crying because something is not theirs, and sometimes laughing strangely because they might find it in the future.
The more they look, the more excited they become, constantly making strange noises in the medicine garden, frightening the mountain chickens and wild boars.
The road to immortality is long, and the future is full of unknowns and excitement for them.
