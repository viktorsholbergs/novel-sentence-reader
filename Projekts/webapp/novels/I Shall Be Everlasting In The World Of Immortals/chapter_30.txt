At the Visiting Peak pavilion.
There was no Xia Felen at this gathering, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.
Zhao Siyao had already reached the eighth layer of Qi-Refining. The vast gap made Lin Yi and Li Ergou sigh wistfully, having no hope of catching up in this life.
As the initiator of the gathering, and the only female cultivator present, the conversation naturally centered around Zhao Siyao.
Through casual conversation, Lan Chang'an and the others learned many secrets of the cultivation world in the Kingdom of Liang that lower-level cultivators would find hard to access. Zhao Siyao even had some understanding of the cultivation situation in the neighboring kingdoms.
Elegant and gracious, Zhao Siyao did not neglect anyone, inquiring about each of the three's recent circumstances and offering advice. When the discussion turned to Lin Yi, it inevitably involved the Hidden Immortal Pavilion he had painstakingly established.
"Fellow Daoist Lin, your 'Hidden Immortal Pavilion' starts from the secular world, doing business for lower-level cultivators. The concept is not bad. But you must be careful not to interfere with the secular dynasties and avoid encroaching on the interests of major sects and clans..." Zhao Siyao's assessment was quite positive.
"This is not solely my achievement," Lin Yi replied humbly, feeling gratified inwardly.
Zhao Siyao then asked, "Fellow Daoist Lin, are you acquainted with Senior Brother Zhang Tieshan?"
"We've had some interactions," Lin Yi answered cautiously, unsure of Zhao Siyao's attitude.
Zhang Tieshan was the one who ranked first in the third trial Illusion Heart Platform of Jin Yun Valley's entrance examination all those years ago. Lan Chang'an had met him once at the Marquis' Residence, rejecting Zhang's invitation to exterminate an evil spirit from a haunted mansion at the time. It was on that occasion that Lin Yi accompanied Zhang in exorcising evil spirits, forging a connection with him.
"Although Zhang Tieshan's aptitude is average, his determination is firm, and he has gained the appreciation of an elder from an outer peak. You being able to associate with him is truly rare!" Zhao Siyao praised him unexpectedly.
This almost made the now mature and steady Lin Yi feel somewhat elated, harboring the illusion that the Celestial Maiden Zhao might actually favor him. Fortunately, he was calm enough to understand the gap between them. No matter how long he had admired her, he dared not show the slightest impropriety before the current Zhao Siyao who was akin to a fairy.
Next, the conversation turned to Li Ergou.
Zhao Siyao couldn't help but smile, finding it hard to connect the well-off gentleman named "Li Changqing" before her with the timid, dark-skinned young farmer from years ago.
"Hahaha! Fellow Daoist Changqing is surrounded by beauties in the cultivation clan, and his cultivation is steadily progressing. If he had joined the sect back then, how could he enjoy the good life he has now?" Lin Yi joked, inevitably feeling envious in his heart.
That farmer boy he had once looked down upon now surpassed him in both status and cultivation in the immortal world.
Lan Chang'an also smiled. If Li Ergou had truly joined the sect, he might not have had such a prosperous life.
"Fellow Daoist Li must be mindful that the mundane desires of the secular world can affect the purity of the six roots. But if those desires can be cleansed, it will aid in cultivating a focused mind." Zhao Siyao offered him advice as well.
Finally, they discussed Lan Chang'an. Zhao Siyao's brilliant, beautiful eyes lingered slightly on Lan Chang'an's face.
When they had first met, she was still a young girl, attracted by the tales of the jianghu and romantic stories Lan Chang'an had told back then.
The closeness from years ago, that indescribable flutter of the heart, had almost been worn away by the passage of over a decade and the vastness of the immortal world.
"Fellow Daoist Lan, although the wood-based cultivation method you practice has a rejuvenating effect, its progress is slow. If you have the opportunity, you may want to consider switching to a fire-based method more suited to you." Zhao Siyao smiled, feeling regretful in her heart.
Originally, Lan Chang'an's aptitude was not bad. But failing to join the sect, that one misstep, led to further mistakes. Now, his cultivation even lagged behind Li Ergou's.
"The path of talismans is a decent skill, but do not become too immersed in it. For us cultivators, the Dao is the root."
"Many thanks to Fellow Daoist Zhao, for your kind guidance." Lan Chang'an could see that Zhao Siyao meant well, and her advice to the three of them was quite reasonable. For ordinary wandering cultivators to receive pointers from a sect cultivator was an extremely rare opportunity.
Next, Lin Yi and Li Ergou consulted Zhao Siyao about various cultivation issues.
"There's no need to be so formal. Let's discuss amongst ourselves."
Without arrogance from her status, Zhao Siyao would occasionally smile, listening attentively, dispelling the initial aloof celestial air that made one not dare to offend her.
The atmosphere became increasingly harmonious.
With a sect fairy-like Zhao Siyao around, the few of them could engage in relaxed and enjoyable exchanges and discussions about cultivation.
Sipping tea and discoursing on the Dao, was a delight to the heart.
Everyone present had gained something.
In the process of explaining, Zhao Siyao would occasionally have flashes of enlightenment and realizations.
Even Lan Chang'an, who was re-cultivating, felt a sense of renewed understanding when discussing these lower-level cultivation contents.
This was the "companionship" aspect of the Immortal Cultivation Path. To communicate with one's fellow practitioners and to be taught by one's master.
Individual wisdom is limited. If one were to constantly seclude themselves, without interacting and exchanging pointers with others, no matter how long the lifespan, they would inevitably face all sorts of obstacles and fetters.
The current harmonious and pleasant atmosphere made Lan Chang'an feel gratified. In his previous two lives, he had encountered too much scheming and the darkness of the world. In his early years of cultivation this life, the few friends he had made were all good-natured. Despite being at different levels of the cultivation world, the four of them had maintained contact for over a decade after first meeting, which was truly commendable.
Of course, Lan Chang'an deeply understood that the human heart was fickle, and with his lifespan remaining long, the future was still unknown.
...
As the sun set, Zhao Siyao finally brought up the main purpose of this gathering.
"Fellow Daoists, Siyao has called you here to request something." Zhao Siyao spoke earnestly.
"Fellow Daoist Zhao, we basically understand your circumstances. Feel free to state your needs." Lin Yi readily replied.
Zhao Siyao nodded with a smile and took out an iron umbrella with some rust. This was a magical weapon, with two sections of the umbrella's frame broken and several obvious cracks on the canopy.
"This is a superior-grade magical weapon passed down in my family, but unfortunately the materials have been damaged, leaving only thirty to forty percent of its power..." Zhao Siyao explained.
She wanted to compete for the core disciple position, but the magical weapon in her possession was not powerful enough. Normally, a superior-grade magical weapon corresponds to the early Foundation Establishment Realm.
But in the sect, disciples' cultivation methods were extraordinary, and their spiritual power profound. Even with just a late Qi-Refining stage cultivation, they could control a superior-grade magical weapon and unleash tremendous power.
To repair this superior-grade magical weapon, Zhao Siyao faced two major difficulties.
First, she lacked spirit stones. Her spirit stones were mainly used for cultivation needs, with no surplus to repair the magical weapon. The deficit was at least two hundred spirit stones.
Second, she could not ask an artifact refiner within the sect to repair this magical weapon, or else its abilities and characteristics might be revealed, unfavorable for her in competing for the core disciple position.
Zhao Siyao did not have any artifact refiners she trusted within the sect. She wanted to commission someone she trusted to get it repaired outside in the market towns, without letting her competitors within the sect know.
The first issue was easily solved.
Lan Chang'an took out one hundred spirit stones.
Lin Yi grudgingly contributed sixty spirit stones.
Li Ergou only offered fifty spirit stones.
A total of two hundred and ten spirit stones. That was enough spirit stones, now the question was who would take on this task.
Lin Yi was vaguely looking forward to it in his heart, after all, the Hidden Immortal Pavilion that he had created was considered a power at the lower cultivation levels.
"Fellow Daoist Lan, do you have time to make a trip to the Five Peaks Market Town and have the artifact refiner Gu Lai repair this magical weapon?" Zhao Siyao's beautiful eyes swept across the three of them before settling on Lan Chang'an.
Aside from maintaining secrecy, repairing the magical weapon would take time, and she currently did not have much free time to go out during this crucial stage of her cultivation.
"I can do it. I was planning to go to the market towns to purchase some materials anyway." Lan Chang'an agreed without a second thought. Even if he didn't help with this favor, he still needed to go to the market to buy first-grade spirit sand and sell off his spoils of war.
On the side, Lin Yi felt envious. For the important task of repairing a superior-grade magical weapon to be entrusted to Lan Chang'an showed Zhao Siyao's trust in his character and abilities.
"There are also two sect missions that I hope Fellow Daoists Lin and Li can assist with." Zhao Siyao's ruby lips curved into a smile as she spoke.
Soon, Lin Yi and Li Ergou each received a mission.
Li Ergou's mission was to go to the capital of the Kingdom of Liang and secretly protect the descendant of a certain Foundation Establishment Realm deacon from Jin Yun Valley for half a year.
The reason was that the political situation in the capital was unstable, and that deacon member held a key official position.
Lin Yi's mission was to collect a rare Moonlight Grass that only grew in specific locations during a full moon night. It was not very valuable, but rather troublesome to obtain.
He was tasked with gathering twenty plants, which would require much effort and possibly take a year.
Zhao Siyao did not have the time for these sect missions, but the sect had an annual requirement, and completing them would earn contributions.
"Zhao Siyao has really thought this through, assigning each of us suitable tasks." Lan Chang'an mused silently.
For example, Li Ergou with the highest cultivation was given the simplest bodyguard mission.
Lin Yi's task was more tedious but not difficult with the Hidden Immortal Pavilion's assistance.
Lan Chang'an's task was the most important, requiring someone steady and trustworthy.
"Fellow Daoists, Siyao will keep today's events in mind."
Before parting, Zhao Siyao stood upright with a curtsy full of grace.
"Fellow Daoist Zhao, there's no need for such courtesy." Lin Yi and Li Ergou were flattered.
...
After bidding farewell to Zhao Siyao, Lan Chang'an and the others headed down the mountain together.
"Brother Lan, do you know why Xia Felen did not come this time?" Lin Yi asked with an air of mystery.
Xia Felen?
Lan Chang'an recalled that alchemy apprentice student from the three-year appointment at the Immortal Gathering Building years ago, who had subtly mocked him and looked down on the three of them during the banquet. This time, Zhao Siyao did not even mention this person.
"Heheh! Let me tell you."
Lin Yi laughed gleefully at the misfortune. "Over the years, Xia Felen has been selling inferior spirit pills and even poisonous pills, harming many wandering cultivators and even descendants of sect cultivators. This matter was reported to the Law Enforcement Hall by Zhang Tieshan, and Xia Felen has recently been detained, soon to face heavy punishment from the sect!"
