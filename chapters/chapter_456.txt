Li Yuanjiao carried the half-dead Hooked Serpent away from the southern shore of Lake Xian at Profound Peak Gate. With the help of the Profound Patterned Bottle, the air was filled with water mist. The Hooked Serpent continued squeaking futilely, begging for mercy.
The creature was enormous, and the mist from the Profound Patterned Bottle could barely conceal it. Li Yuanjiao had only reached the shore when he was forced to land with a frown.
It's too conspicuous... This demon creature is also incredibly heavy. Putting aside the drain on my mana, it's impractical to fly over the wilderness and temples like this.
He swiftly changed course, flying north for a while, intending to go upstream of the river flowing into Lake Xian, pass through the safer territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect, and then only return to Moongaze Lake's northern shore via Xu State.
The travel journals left by Uncle Ling mentioned that the surging river aids those cultivating the Boundless Ocean, so this seems like a good opportunity to explore that.
Li Yuanjiao's Jing Dragon King was a serpent dragon of the lake, which allowed him to dive effortlessly into the water. Submerged, the weight of the Hooked Serpent lightened considerably due to natural buoyancy.
He first summoned several crab demons to inquire about the power dynamics at the lake's bottom and the locations of the demon kings. After planning his route, he dragged the Hooked Serpent slowly forward while pondering Kong Tingyun's recent words.
The Profound Peak Gate could be useful as an ally. I wonder how strong Daoist Master Changxi is… He appears to have a backing.
This could be a good opportunity to form a connection… Too bad my family lacks a suitable cultivator. Otherwise, things would be so much better with a strategic ally to watch over Mount Yue.
I wonder if this is truly Daoist Master Changxi's intention… Whose pawn is he?
As Li Yuanjiao mused on, he ignored the demon creature's chatter. The Hooked Serpent, observing his cautious demeanor, grew despondent and fell silent. After a lengthy pause, it sighed.
"Every demon said that the land is treacherous, yet I was skeptical. I coveted spirit items, only to face the fate of becoming serpent soup!"
Li Yuanjiao glanced at it and asked, "What is your Immortal Foundation?"
"Those at the Demon Palace call it Morning Cold Rain… I'm not sure what you all name it. I cultivate a feathered serpent while you cultivate a serpent dragon. I doubt I'm fit for consumption... If you desire so, I can find a serpent dragon for you, Exalted Immortal," the Hooked Serpent offered.
Li Yuanjiao listened quietly as he walked along the riverbed.
"You worry too much, fellow Daoist. I am neither from a demon den nor a dragon palace capable of binding spirits, nor am I from a temple with the means to purify demonic natures. How can I trust you? Once freed, you would surely flee."
The Hooked Serpent, fully aware of its predicament, curled up listlessly.
Li Yuanjiao pondered as he walked.
Although we subdued the Hooked Serpent in just a few moves, we've mostly relied on external power. The Qingche Sword and Profound Patterned Bottle, being Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts, played a part, not to mention Kong Tingyun's golden mountain and pearl, coupled with that powerful formation—all of which helped suppress this Hooked Serpent.
He observed the serpent's forked tail now without the hooks, unsightly from where Kong Tingyun had cut it.
I wonder if Senior White Banyan Fox is still beneath that tree... There's no need to rush to sacrifice this serpent demon. It might be wise to consult it first.
As he continued along the river, the water shifted between darkness and light, revealing lavish demon palaces, towers made of shells, and white caves.
Encountering two Foundation Establishment Realm demon generals patrolling the area, they were so intimidated by the sight of Li Yuanjiao dragging the Hooked Serpent that they did not dare to even lift their heads before quickly scurrying away.
Li Yuanjiao did not encounter the river's turbulent waves that Li Xuanling spoke of nor did he receive any cultivation enlightenment. Observing the river's wide and lengthy expanse, he mused to himself, "The rivers are broad and long… there should be many treasures here."
Reaching the territory of the Yue Cultivating Sect, Li Yuanjiao emerged from the water with the Hooked Serpent. A cultivator in white, with a sword on his back, stood before him, appearing to be deducing something. Nevertheless, he did not seem to be upset by the interruption caused by Li Yuanjiao.
"Nian Yi from Yue Cultivating Sect greets Senior! Congratulations on capturing the demon general," he said.
Despite Nian Yi being a mere Qi Cultivator, Li Yuanjiao treated him with respect and said, "Apologies for the disturbance, fellow Daoist. I am just passing through your sect's territory."
Nian Yi nodded, then grasped a wisp of spiritual qi and slowly closed his eyes, resuming his deduction.
Traveling southward, Li Yuanjiao observed that Xu State was peaceful—a stark contrast to the chaos of years past. There were no signs of devil cultivators, and the cultivators flying about seemed open and unguarded.
The rogue cultivators he encountered were also courteous, congratulating him on capturing the formidable demon.
"Yue Cultivating Sect is truly different," he sighed in amazement.
Li Yuanjiao pressed on until he finally returned to Moongaze Lake. Several Qi Cultivators from the Li Family came to greet him, led by Li Xuanxuan who looked visibly relieved and greeted him warmly, "Jiao'er, you've returned safely!"
This journey proved quite fruitful, and Li Yuanjiao could not help but laugh as he deposited the Hooked Serpent on the shore. He swiftly reinforced several prohibitions, and soon, Li Family cultivators swarmed the area, sealing and setting up a formation to secure the demon.
Returning to the mountain, Li Yuanjiao laid out the treasures acquired from his expedition. Li Qinghong and the others could barely contain their joy and excitement.
The Profound Patterned Bottle and Profound Yang Li Fire were exceptional finds, and capturing a Foundation Establishment Realm serpent demon was indeed a significant achievement. Li Qinghong picked up the Profound Patterned Bottle carefully, admiring it while wistfully thinking, Too bad Big Brother has already named it. It's such a magnificent Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, yet its name sounds like an Embryonic Breathing Realm qi gathering bottle… I guess we'll just have to accept its basic name…
While the group examined the two treasures, an old man came in. He appeared to be over ninety years old, his frame stooped with age. The cultivators kneeled and bowed deeply to him.
Li Qinghong quickly stepped forward to support him while Li Xuanxuan introduced the newcomer.
"This is rogue cultivator Qian… he's ninety-eight years old."
Handing over three storage pouches to the old man, Li Xuanxuan said, "As agreed before, please proceed, Elder."
Old Man Qian nodded and began to inspect the first pouch. He extended his spiritual sense into it, causing the shimmering treasures inside to spill out onto the floor.
Relieved, he opened the second pouch. After verifying its contents without encountering any traps, Li Xuanxuan handed him a Spirit Stone and a smile crossed the old man's face.
Li Yuanjiao observed the proceedings with keen interest, his eyes narrowed slightly as Old Man Qian reached for the third pouch—exceptional-looking and black, previously owned by a daring devil cultivator.
As soon as the old man's spiritual sense reached into it, a burst of black gas erupted. Li Yuanjiao had already anticipated this and readied a spell to counter it. Old Man Qian could only scream in agony before he exploded, now reduced to a mere puddle of blood.
Li Xuanxuan swiftly cast a spell to remove the gruesome remains from the cave dwelling and called out in a calm voice, "Please get Elder Ding in here."
Li Yuanjiao murmured thoughtfully, "It appears to be a shamanic spell or blood art, devised by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator… It's capable of eroding both spiritual sense and the body. No wonder an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator couldn't even withstand it for a moment!"
Li Qinghong, who was standing by, shook her head solemnly and asked, "How much for his pension?"
"Three Spirit Stones to be sent to his son. We'll also secure a position for him at the peak."
