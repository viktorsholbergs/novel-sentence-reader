In front of him, the golden light spread out in countless radiances, drifting through the air lightly. Lu Jiangxian held it in his hand, feeling a warm, gentle sensation, as numerous illusions unfolded beside him, with all kinds of colors streaming gracefully.
These visions alternated between scenes of union between men and women, sparrows taking flight, and orioles chirping, to resplendent bursts of light, lonely smoke rising, and even images of emperors in reverence, receiving crowns and ascending thrones. Ultimately, they transformed into a pure, glowing orb.
A sudden insight dawned within him: this metallic essence was fully named Bright Radiant Yang Imperial Union Essence, embodying growth, union, the harmony of male and female, celestial light, bright fire… all things related to the Bright Yang.
"The Sun Seeker Ring is indeed unusual… It is likely that Xu Xiao extracted it from the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. As for how it came to be within that token, I'd need to get my hands on the Purple Mansion Realm artifact to truly understand!" Lu Jiangxian pondered aloud.
His mind had already begun to linger on the Six Ding Merging Fire Token. As the metallic essence danced in his hand, a wealth of insights came to him—this essence could be used to transform demonic creatures, influence fate, and establish bonds between individuals. Its potential was powerful and expansive.
"So, this is the nature of metallic essence… it is astonishing to witness such marvels from just a single wisp!"
Holding the wisp of Bright Yang Metallic Essence, Lu Jiangxian's initial amazement faded into a more pragmatic contemplation of how he might use it.
"First of all, this must not be given to anyone else…"
He quickly dismissed the idea of bestowing it upon anyone in the Li Family, because even if they had the capacity to wield it, this single wisp would likely cause significant trouble if released!
If his guess was correct—if this metallic essence were to fall into the world, it would instantly lead to unchecked indulgence, spontaneous births, rampant growth of all things, and finally transform into a monstrous evil, bringing about wanton killing and attracting the wrath of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.
"After all, metallic essence is a rare treasure to a cultivator of the Purple Mansion Realm, especially when the Bright Yang Fruition Attainment seems to be within the possession of Mount Luoxia..." Lu Jiangxian mumbled.
Having seen both the Six Ding Merging Fire Token and the Bright Yang Metallic Essence, Lu Jiangxian began to formulate deeper insights. The crafting of Purple Mansion Realm artifacts was likely closely tied to metallic essences.
The Six Ding Merging Fire Token, for example, might have been forged through Merging Fire and thereby imbued with the qualities of a malevolent creature, which would explain its peculiar effects.
"If that is the case, then the Sun Seeker Ring contains the Bright Yang essence, while the Six Ding Merging Fire Token likely embodies the Merging Fire essence. By that logic, this mirror… should also contain an essence…"
Lu Jiangxian pondered thoughtfully to himself, recalling the mirror's continuous outpouring of Supreme Yin Moonlight as he speculated further, "It seems undeniably to be of Supreme Yin essence… Judging by its abundance, could it contain the entire Supreme Yin Fruition Attainment? It's definitely more than just Supreme Yin, given how the Supreme Yin Moonlight flows endlessly; like an unending stream."
Lu Jiangxian had traveled widely over the last century, studying countless texts, yet he had never encountered a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator in the Supreme Yin system. The few Supreme Yin and Lesser Yin methods he found were of low grade, with none capable of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.
He had never heard of a Golden Core Realm cultivator in the Supreme Yin system either; only one ancient immortal called Yingze seemed possibly related to Supreme Yin or Yang systems, but that was several millennia ago.
"At the very least, this Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual could be refined a few more times!"
Looking over the Bright Yang Metallic Essence in his hand which was emanating a gentle warmth, Lu Jiangxian thought to himself, With this metallic essence in hand, I finally have some influence over the external world, though I must be cautious and remain discreet to avoid attracting the attention of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.
After some deliberation, he acknowledged both the advantages and disadvantages of wielding the Bright Yang Metallic Essence. It could potentially manifest as divine light to injure enemies, but such use would squander its value, and he resolved to employ it sparingly.
As for members of the Li Family pursuing this path, there were no other Dao Partners in Yue State, and the Wei-Li bloodline obscured things well enough to prevent suspicion.
Only the north presented a concern as he thought silently, The Mahas in the north harbor an unshakable blood feud with the Wei-Li Clan, and now Mount Luoxia also has designs on Bright Yang Metallic Essence... the north is best avoided!
Fortunately, the Mahas seldom venture south unless they are reincarnated, and Luoxia remains aloof, unlikely to meddle across vast distances. The Eastern Sea contains several Bright Yang Dao lineages, so issues should be minimal.
Drawing his thoughts back from the metallic essence in hand, Lu Jiangxian began to reflect on the yield from his journey to the Eastern Sea.
During the trip, he accompanied the Li Family, but spent most of his time drifting on the sea, rarely disembarking. When they did find the Green Pine Temple ruins, they bore traces of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, so Lu Jiangxian refrained from peering in too deeply.
Nevertheless, he had managed to gather a considerable number of techniques which supplemented his understanding of Metallic Essence, allowing him to piece together some key insights.
"Many of the techniques had ancient origins, often containing references to Metallic Essence Fruition Attainments."
These findings often mentioned various Yin and Yang Fruition Attainments. Some sources referred to three Yin and four Yang, while others cited five Yin and four Yang. However, one fact seemed consistent—Yin and Yang Fruition Attainments were not equal in number.
Similarly, many Fruition Attainments seemed isolated, and suspiciously so. For example, Shamanic Talisman, Jade True, and Merging Owl… these Metallic Essences emerged independently and it was rare to find more than one associated cultivation technique.
With these questions resting in the back of his mind, he was quietly contemplating when a familiar feedback suddenly came from the link within the great void. Lu Jiangxian understood immediately.
Li Ximing has broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!
At the time, Li Ximing had been cultivating on Mount Qingdu when the Bright Yang Essence had brushed past him. He cultivated the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual, the Bright Yang system. This was equivalent to having a peak Purple Mansion Realm expert use their divine abilities to secure his breakthrough. With the opportunity laid so plainly before him and if he still could not advance, he might as well find a rock to hit his head on.
"This child is indeed fortunate…"
Were it not that Li Ximing lacked any apparent thread of fate, Lu Jiangxian might have really thought he was a Fated One.
Born into a clan, nurtured by his entire family, innately gifted for alchemy, with a penchant for secluded cultivation that keeps him from venturing out unless in the direst circumstances… He seems almost like a Fated One. Throughout the entire clan, only he has hope of reaching the Purple Mansion Realm.
Returning his focus to the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual before him, Lu Jiangxian was confident that with the assistance of the metallic essence, he could elevate the manual to an even higher level!
Once this manual is refined, I can explore combining Metallic Essence with talisman qi!
Time in the mirror world always seemed to flow like water. Back then, Lu Jiangxian always felt lonely and bored, now, time felt almost scarce.
