The group of cultivators from Milin Prefecture paid their tributes. The Dawn Cloudliner, with its colorful radiance and long tail, docked in the sky, casting a beautiful golden-red reflection.
Meanwhile at the Li Residence…
In a dim room shrouded in white mist, a bluish-gray mirror slowly floated up, vibrating incessantly and emitting dazzling white light. Lu Jiangxian's divine sense suppressed the trembling of the mirror, and he was filled with suspicion and alarm.
"T-This is...!"
Various illusions appeared before his eyes—a rushing clear stream, a treasure vault glittering with mana lights, a young boy's tender face, fair arms, towering mountains with immortals traversing them, gushing spirit springs, and a cave-dwelling abundant with spiritual qi.
Finally… the vision lingered on the radiant Dawn Cloudliner.
"There is a mirror fragment on the Dawn Cloudliner!"
Lu Jiangxian had experienced this reaction before. The jade stones by the lake and the jade pendant in the old Daoist's hand had both caused similar feelings of trepidation. Now that the mirror's power had gradually recovered, these impulses had grown even stronger.
"Who is it..."
The mirror floated up again, with twelve ancient runes shining one by one on its surface. If not for Lu Jiangxian's suppression, it would have already flown away long ago, drawing the fragments together in reunion.
This sensation and phenomenon even emanated from the mirror, ricocheting within the sealed dark room and transforming into various mystical visions.
Patterns on the ground suddenly sprouted osmanthus trees with golden-white flowers hanging down from their branches. Their stamens were like gold, exuding a pleasant fragrance, and appearing particularly brilliant in the misty moonlight.
The rustling sound grew louder, and a few energetic and lively toads hopped out from the shadows, playing among the fallen osmanthus flowers. A jade buckle appeared in the reflection of the bluish-gray mirror.
"Yu Muxian..! It is on Yu Muxian!"
Amidst the illusions, Lu Jiangxian recognized the face resembling Yu Mugao's, exuding an ethereal aura. Who else could it be but Yu Muxian?
RUMBLE!
The sunlight above the Li Residence dimmed. The mirror's internal world shook, its tremors tracing back through the connection of the talisman seeds. Outside, the talisman seeds trembled, emitting white light.
Li Ximing, who was the closest, was quietly reading an alchemy text in the great hall. His qihai acupoint suddenly churned, radiating brilliant light that caused him intense pain, making him cry out in agony.
"AHH!"
He curled up in pain, breaking out in a cold sweat almost immediately.
Li Yuanping, who was reading a secret letter in the Clan Affairs Courtyard, was startled by the child's scream. He jumped up, not even bothering to put on his shoes, and rushed to the child's side.
"Ming'er! Ming'er!" he called out anxiously.
Li Ximing was Li Yuanping's only son and a precious asset to the Li Family. Naturally, his distress threw Li Yuanping into a panic. He reached out to touch the child's forehead and found it cold and clammy, much to his dismay. When he lifted his hand, he discovered it was covered in transparent mucus.
"This..."
The mucus was icy cold. As it dripped to the ground, it transformed into golden-white petals that scattered everywhere, leaving Li Yuanping stunned.
The petals were striking, shattering upon contact with the ground and rising as bright, moon-like yin energy. The sight blew Li Yuanping's mind.
Dou Yi, standing at the far end, was terrified by the scene. With Li Yuanping's lifespan limited and Madam Dou being heartless, the entire Dou Family depended on young Li Ximing. Dou Yi hurriedly rushed up the steps, alarmed by the turn of events.
"Young master?!"
As the Li Family ascended to the status of a clan, more and more rogue cultivators visited, and the standards for such visits were modeled after those of other clans in Yue State. The upper staircase had over twenty steps, and it took Dou Yi several moments to climb them all.
Dou Yi had just ascended the last few steps when he rushed forward to find Li Yuanping. Li Yuanping turned abruptly, his gray-black pupils dilated, and his forehead covered in a sheen of sweat. The gentleness in his face was completely gone, replaced by a grim and fierce expression.
"Get out!!" he shouted fiercely.
Dou Yi had been with him for almost ten years and had only ever seen such an expression on Li Yuanjiao's face. Li Yuanping was usually much more composed and gentle, and seeing him like this now made Dou Yi's heart pound in fear. He stumbled backward, missed a step, and fell, rolling down the dozen steps.
THUD!
Living a life of luxury and indulgence in recent years had left Dou Yi quite plump, and he rolled all the way to the bottom of the stairs with a heavy thud. Without daring to lift his head, he grabbed his robe and scrambled out of the hall hastily.
Li Yuanping stood at the top, his body trembling slightly. He dared not move an inch, using his wide robe to cover the trembling Li Ximing in his arms.
"Everyone, leave!" he instructed firmly.
It was not until the clinking sounds of armor had faded and the guards at the sides of the stairs had retreated did he quickly grab the alchemy book from the table.
In his haste, Li Yuanping knocked over ink and brushes which fell with a clatter. He paid no attention to the mess, frantically patting the few bright streams of moonlight-like energy beneath him.
Only when the last of the Supreme Yin Moonlight disappeared and the entire hall had turned cold did a bit of color return to his face.
"Father..."
Li Ximing attempted to rise amidst the scattered osmanthus petals.
Li Yuanping hurriedly embraced him, relieved to find that the boy was unharmed. He murmured, "Immortal Mirror... It's the Immortal Mirror..."
Meanwhile on Mount Wutu…
Li Xizhi suddenly looked up, staring at the scattered petals in his hands.
Hundreds of li away at the Cloud Crowned Peak market, Li Xuanxuan, who was bargaining with a customer, abruptly fell silent, hearing a faint rustling sound...
In the Yi Mountain City...
In the Milin Prefecture...
All those who received a Profound Pearl Talisman Seed looked up simultaneously, gazing into the distance pensively as an ethereal face and a translucent, smooth jade buckle appeared before their eyes.
Li Yuanjiao suddenly raised his head, the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his qihai acupoint vibrating intensely. A point of white light appeared in his eyes and he felt a strong attraction, his gaze fixed on Yu Muxian's white robe.
"Yu Muxian... Jade buckle..."
Seeing Yu Muxian seemingly sense something and look up, Li Yuanjiao slowly lowered his head. He had once read in the family's history about Li Tongya back when he was still a mortal, who had ventured into the reed marshes at night and found that jade stone, a feat that seemed impossible.
The vastness of the reed marshes made it akin to finding a needle in a haystack… How could a mere mortal find it? He had attributed it to Li Tongya's unique fortune, which was different from ordinary people.
Now, truly facing the legendary treasure that could fuse with the mirror, he realized its wondrous nature. Even without looking at Yu Muxian, he could feel the jade buckle in his hand.
At the top, Yu Muxian felt a sudden sense of unease, a fleeting pang that vanished as quickly as it came, leaving no trace behind.
Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who had refined their immortal foundations possessed certain mystic abilities. A sudden premonition was a significant matter, but after thoroughly inspecting himself and finding nothing out of place, he could only cast suspicious glances at those below him.
"Milin Prefecture's Yu Family!"
The attendant of the immortal sect began calling names, and Yu Muxian dismissed his distractions, quietly watching his brother bow and withdraw. He then stood upright.
His gaze lingered on Yu Mugao's gaunt cheeks and haggard figure. The burdens of thought and schemes seemed to have crushed the man. Despite being at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm cultivation, he was tormented to this state by the internal strife and intense struggles within the Yu Family.
With Yu Xiaogui severely injured and in seclusion, the various branches of the Yu Family, already dissatisfied with Yu Mugao's control, had erupted into chaos, each faction acting independently. If not for the absence of news confirming Yu Xiaogui's death and Yu Mugao's ruthless methods, the situation might have already turned disastrous.
