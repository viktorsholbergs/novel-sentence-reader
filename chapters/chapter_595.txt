Just as Li Xuanfeng opened the book, an entire row of inked characters abruptly blurred, leaping off the page one after another in a cascade of light before vanishing entirely.
The ancient book flipped wildly in the air, its pages turning with a loud whoosh. Li Xuanfeng was struck by a wave of dizziness, and in his ears, he heard the sound of waves crashing north to south, filling the heavens and earth. The waves collided against cliffs, followed by a cold rain pouring down.
With a bang, the book disintegrated into ash, scattering across the ground. Yet the moment the ash touched the earth, it transformed into black ants, wriggling frantically as they scurried away and disappeared into the soil.
Li Xuanfeng's mind buzzed, and his gaze dropped to his own hands in a momentary daze. Nearby, Lin Chensheng turned to him and asked, "Daoist, did you finish reading all six of those techniques?"
Snapped out of his stupor, Li Xuanfeng lifted his head and nodded, "Yes, I have read them all. Unfortunately, none of them exceed the Qi Cultivation Realm."
Lin Chensheng chuckled softly and replied, "No need to worry. Once the third drum sounds in the Sea of Clouds, there will be plenty to choose from."
Li Yuanjiao and Tu Longjian wandered through the forest for a while, the surroundings soon becoming enveloped in thick white mist. Growing suspicious, Li Yuanjiao said softly, "Daoist, this mist rises strangelyâ€”be cautious."
Tu Longjian smiled faintly, his gaze sweeping across the mist, "This fog can block spiritual senses; it is indeed peculiar. Let us take to the skies instead. Stay close behind me, and do not fall behind."
Li Yuanjiao, ever cunning, heard this and immediately suspected something. He deduced with seventy percent certainty that the descent of the grotto heaven was imminent. Nodding, he took to the air, sticking closely to Tu Longjian's side.
As soon as they rose into the sky, the setting sun on the horizon vanished in an instant, replaced by a brilliant expanse of stars. The stars hung motionless, perfectly aligned in the heavens.
The surrounding ocean had completely disappeared, leaving behind an endless sea of clouds and undulating mountain ranges. Feigning alarm, Li Yuanjiao exclaimed, "This is not good! We have fallen into someone's illusory formation!"
Tu Longjian's expression grew serious as he scrutinized Li Yuanjiao's reaction. Seeing this, his final doubts dissipated. Laughing heartily, he said, "Senior, this is none other than the Mirrored Mirage Grotto Heaven!"
Li Yuanjiao's expression turned to one of genuine surprise. The plan had always been to reach the Green Pine Grotto Heaven, so how had the Mirrored Mirage suddenly come into play?
Sensing his confusion, Tu Longjian explained, "The Green Pine Temple lies within the Mirrored Mirage Grotto Heaven, which has remained sealed for countless years. Those ignorant of its secrets simply linked the two names together. The Daoist Masters have been more than happy to let this misnomer persist."
Continuing his explanation, Tu Lingjian said, "This grotto heaven was originally created by the ancient cultivator Yingze, borrowing from the Dao lineage of the Immortal Lord. How could it have been called Green Pine Grotto Heaven?"
Li Yuanjiao outwardly feigned shock at this revelation, but inwardly, his thoughts churned with even greater alarm. Based on Tu Longjian's words and actions thus far, he felt increasingly certain, This man has almost certainly uncovered the truthâ€¦ perhaps even freed himself from the control of the Daoist Masters!
Furrowing his brows, Li Yuanjiao let a mix of joy and apprehension cross his face. Speaking in a low tone, he said, "Since we have been fortunate enough to enter, this is undoubtedly a great opportunity. Whether or not we leave here alive, howeverâ€¦ that is another matter entirely."
Tu Longjian gave a slight nod, and Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist respectfully, "It seems that Daoist Longjian is well-versed in the grotto heaven. I will have to rely on you for the remainder of our journey."
Tu Longjian smiled and replied, "Senior, there is no need for such formality."
After exchanging a few words, the two agreed to continue traveling together. Li Yuanjiao, uninterested in the treasures of the grotto heaven, was focused on finding Yu Muxian. He wondered whether his elder had already encountered him or even begun fighting.
Tu Longjian rose into the air alongside him, choosing a random direction. Standing at ease on the clouds, his gaze fixed on the distant mountain ranges, while the token at his waist swayed lightly.
After orienting himself, he selected a route through the layers of clouds. They flew for a while before hearing the sounds of commotion and combat.
"Someone has beaten us to itâ€¦" Tu Longjian frowned, muttering his displeasure. The golden hammer reappeared in his hand.
Moments later, the clouds ahead began to tremble violently as lights of various spells and techniques clashed in midair. The sound of artifacts striking each other rang out like metal on metal.
About five or six cultivators surrounded a small hill, warily guarding against one another. Atop the hill was a tall stone platform, upon which rested a small jade bottle.
The bottle was intricately carved with silver osmanthus blossoms and encased in a silver-white spirit barrier. Its purpose or origin was unclear, but the edges of the barrier exuded strands of moonlit mist, ethereal and serene, giving it an extraordinary, otherworldly quality.
At the center of the group stood a middle-aged man in a dark Daoist robe, his expression cold and stern. Tall and thin, his robes were adorned with subtle patterns that spoke of exceptional craftsmanship, marking them as refined Dharma attire. In his hand, he held a purple sandalwood duster and scanned the crowd with icy eyes, speaking softly, "This Foundation Establishment Realm spirit barrierâ€¦ belongs to Changxiao Gate. Consider your actions carefully, all of you."
Nearby, a red-robed cultivator sneered in response, his tone mocking as he retorted, "Well then, Xun Yizi, take your precious barrier and leave. Let the rest of us see what kind of treasure lies within that jade bottle!"
The tall, gaunt man in the Daoist robes didn't respond, his cold gaze sweeping over the crowd. From their perch amidst the clouds, Li Yuanjiao and Tu Longjian silently observed the scene, their eyes scanning the five or six cultivators.
Among them was a female cultivator in a light purple Daoist robe. Petite and refined, she stood atop a floating cloud, carefully examining the object within the spirit barrier. One delicate hand held a small golden mountain, while the other gripped a jade orb. She was none other than Kong Tingyun of the Profound Peak Gate!
On the opposite side stood a young man with a refined appearance, his brows furrowed as if debating whether to retreat. Though Li Yuanjiao had only seen him a few times, the young man's face was etched into his memory.
Zhong Qian!
Li Yuanjiao continued observing, scrutinizing the identities and backgrounds of the others. Meanwhile, Tu Longjian's gaze burned with intensity as he murmured, "Seniorâ€¦ whatever's inside that jade bottle must be something extraordinary! If a fight breaks out, just worry about keeping yourself safe."
Hearing this, Li Yuanjiao shifted his focus to the tall platform.
The platform itself was unremarkable, constructed of ordinary materials. The silver-white spirit barrier atop it, however, was far from ordinary. Its faint glow exuded an aura of strength, and its four corners were engraved with motifs of moon rabbitsâ€”marking it as a Foundation Establishment Realm artifact from the ancient cultivators.
Within the barrier, a silver-white bottle seemed to faintly emerge and recede. Overflowing with spiritual energy, the bottle's moonlit patterns were ancient and enigmatic yet oddly familiar. The moonlit mist drifting around the bottle was so familiar it could not be mistaken.
Li Yuanjiao silently chuckled to himself. The sight of the mist was unmistakableâ€”he had seen it thousands of times in his own household. He knew exactly what it was, and its value was enough to drive every cultivator present mad with greed, Supreme Yin Moonlight Essence!
