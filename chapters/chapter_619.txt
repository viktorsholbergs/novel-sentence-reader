Li Qinghong surveyed the group, and after a brief discussion about the family's recent changes, found no significant issues. Li Xijun then spoke softly, "News has arrived from outside. Ancestor Yuan Licheng of the Yuan Family failed in his Purple Mansion Realm breakthrough and perished in meditation. This prolonged rain outside is likely the celestial phenomenon marking his death."
Li Qinghong, prompted by this comment, recalled something and said quietly, "When I was fighting for treasures near Green Pine Island, I saved someone from the Han Family. I overheard that a Yuan Family cultivator had died. After all, they are allies…"
Li Xijun nodded, "I have already sent someone to investigate."
Li Qinghong frowned slightly and remarked, "I have heard that Ancestor Yuan Licheng once studied under Daoist Master Buzi. Later, he was exiled for committing a transgression. Now that Buzi is missing, and Yuan Licheng has passed, the Yuan Family is likely to face a difficult period."
Li Xijun looked at the unrelenting downpour in the sky and nodded slightly, "Let us hope this does not affect the sect. If we count the days, Brother Xizhi should be close to breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm."
In the world within the Mirror.
Lu Jiangxian held the Bright Yang Metallic Essence in his hand, and with his elevated inherent rank, he had spent half a month carefully linking it to the fetus before cautiously withdrawing.
Because it was still an unborn child, he dared not establish too deep a connection, fearing that the Bright Yang might ignite and destroy both mother and child. The task was extremely delicate; even with his mastery of immortal techniques, it had taken him half a month to establish a preliminary connection. Had it been his earlier self, such a complex task would have been impossible.
"Though difficult, it was flawless!" Lu Jiangxian marveled at the brilliance of his method.
Using the mirror's undetectable properties, he stored the Metallic Essence within the mirror and subtly extended its influence outward. Coupled with the True Insight Profound Method, even if Pristine Water personally inspected it, unless they first located the mirror itself, they would be unable to detect the child's anomaly. They would simply assume the child was born bearing a thread of fate.
As Lu Jiangxian admired his ingenuity, the mirror grew increasingly radiant with the fusion of the jade buckle. Retracting his divine sense, he closed his eyes and immersed himself in the experience.
It had been far too long since Lu Jiangxian had acquired a new component for the mirror. Compared to his earlier days in this realm—when pieces came one after another, rendering him unconscious for years—this jade buckle caused only a slight weariness.
"Three Talisman Seeds, the Supreme Yin Profound Light raised to the Purple Mansion Realm... these are but secondary gains." These upgrades did not move him deeply. Over the past half month, the jade buckle had gradually dissolved, granting the mirror a new, special ability. "Traversing the Great Void!"
The jade buckle had seemingly been the immortal mirror's original mechanism for entering the Great Void, but it had been extracted and condensed into its current form. Now, with its reintegration, this capability was restored to the mirror.
Lu Jiangxian finally let out a long breath of relief. After toiling in this realm for so many years, the immortal mirror could now connect to the Great Void and traverse it freely. Combined with the mirror's inscrutable nature, it meant that no one below the Golden Core Realm could hope to reach him.
Moreover, he no longer needed to be carted across the world by others. The immortal mirror could now float within the Great Void, allowing him to descend from any Talisman Seed at will.
Not only that, he could use the Great Void to communicate with any Talisman Seed and unleash the Supreme Yin Profound Light in a grand display, annihilating his enemies. This meant that if Lu Jiangxian resolved to kill a cultivator in the Purple Mansion Realm, there were few places in the world where they could hide.
Of course, the Great Void was an unpredictable realm filled with countless demons and entities. Attempting to strike across vast distances from within it was akin to lighting firecrackers next to slumbering Golden Core Realm cultivators.
With his thoughts sorted, Lu Jiangxian's spirits soared. Slowly forming a hand seal, the ritual altar outside—engraved with intricate patterns—began to transform. The pale grayish-blue surface of the mirror gradually turned bright white. Lu Jiangxian felt a chill spread through his entire being, and the illusions around him dissipated as the mirror vanished from its place.
Li Xuanfeng spent only half a month in seclusion, during which his injuries recovered significantly, almost to seventy or eighty percent. After all, the medicinal salve he applied was a rare treasure, with a single dose costing over a hundred and eighty spirit stones. Its efficacy was naturally remarkable.
"It is effective, but still… it cannot always be calculated like this…" Li Xuanfeng shook his head.
Upon reaching the late Foundation Establishment Realm or even the Purple Mansion Realm, the value of spirit stones diminished significantly. Genuine Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts, elixirs, and precious spiritual qi or spirit water were rarely traded with spirit stones. Instead, bartering became the norm.
He touched the storage pouch at his waist, taking out several letters and a few artifacts. Reflecting to himself, he thought, I will need to find an opportunity… to circle around the lake.
Back during the Azure Pond Sect's recruitment, he was not the only one from the family to leave for the southern border. Over the years, many of those who had left had either perished or suffered grievous wounds, leaving only a few still alive.
Upon hearing that Li Xuanfeng was leaving the southern border, these cultivators naturally wrote him letters. For those who had passed away, their relics were entrusted to the city for safekeeping. Since they had fought alongside him, the sentiment still lingered, and Li Xuanfeng felt obliged to visit the families of his fallen comrades to return their belongings.
As Li Xuanfeng pondered these matters, he slowly adjusted his breathing. Soon after, he emerged from the cave dwelling, his thoughts shifting, The immortal mirror absorbed the jade buckle but has not shown any reaction for some time. I should go check on it.
He made his way to the secret chamber, raising his brow slightly as a pang of alarm surged through his chest. To his astonishment, the altar stood empty, devoid of anything.
"What!" He froze briefly, his heart suddenly sinking. However, he faintly sensed something still present before him. Focusing his gaze, he noticed that the talisman seed within his body stirred. To his shock, a faint, illusory shadow appeared on the altar. "This is… an entry into the Great Void?"
At that moment, an intangible ripple spread outward. Outside, Li Qinghong abruptly lifted her head, her expression revealing a trace of joy. Her gaze seemed to pierce through the clouds, sensing the immortal mirror's shadow in a certain direction.
On a stone path, Li Xijun also raised his brow sharply, an instant comprehension flooding his mind. Just as a look of astonishment crossed his face, the golden and resplendent Alchemy Pavilion before him emitted a loud explosion, releasing a column of crimson flames. Li Ximing emerged from the flames, covered in soot. It was evident that the sudden realization had disrupted his pill refinement.
The two brothers exchanged glances and nodded in unison. Li Xijun spoke in a low voice, "It is the jade buckle!"
Li Ximing, highly gifted in alchemy, rarely experienced cauldron explosions. This was his first time ending up in such a disheveled state. With a casual wave, he cast a cleansing spell on himself and hurriedly joined Li Xijun in heading toward the ancestral hall.
Meanwhile, within the secret chamber, Li Xuanfeng continued to gaze at the now empty altar. Having encountered and learned much during his time in the southern border and through his interactions with Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, he quickly pieced together the situation. Numerous thoughts flashed through his mind as he deliberated before removing the Qingche Sword from his waist.
When Li Yuanjiao designed the altar, he had carefully considered various contingencies, even preparing for the possibility of using the Qingche Sword as a substitute. Li Xuanfeng gently placed the sword on the altar. It fit perfectly, as though it had always belonged there.
Behind him, the stone door shifted slightly, and several direct descendants of the Li Family hurried in. Li Xuanfeng waved his hand, signaling for them to leave.
