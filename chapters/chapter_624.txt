Holding the child in his arms, Li Xuanxuan looked down at him while Li Xuanfeng pondered for a moment and spoke, "The matter of Green Pine Temple is complex, tangled with conflicting interests. Whether this child bears a thread of fate or not, the talents scattered across Jiangnan were almost entirely swept up in one fell swoop. Let this serve as a lesson for our family to remain vigilant."
He briefly explained the events surrounding Green Pine Temple and continued, "When a Golden Core Realm cultivator reincarnates, Jiangnan produces numerous prodigies, all somewhat bearing a thread of fate. Several immortal sects have secretly observed this and guided these individuals to Green Pine Temple for their own use and consumption."
Li Xuanfeng explained, "To truly discern the fate bearer, even Purple Mansion Realm cultivators struggle. The ones who arrived at Green Pine Temple were mostly wandering geniuses, already marked by thread of fate, which made them easier for the immortal sects to notice."
He scanned the room and added, "But what about those prodigies who fell into the clans and the direct lineages of immortal sects? Surely some exist. Even if not as extreme as someone like Tu Longjian, they are still exceptional talents. Those families understand the stakes and have hidden their prodigies well."
Li Xuanfeng noted, "After all, if rogue cultivators succeed too easily, it raises suspicions. But for the children of clans and immortal sects, it is natural for them to advance smoothly through Qi Cultivation Realm and Foundation Establishment Realm—who could call that abnormal?"
Finally, Li Xuanfeng's voice softened, "By the time this child grows up, our family will likely control Moongaze Lake and rival prestigious clans like the Yuan or Han families. With connections to several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, claiming Bright Yang bloodline status will not expose us to undue covetousness. But be wary of Buddhist cultivators."
Once he said this, everyone nodded. After all, fate was an unseen and untouchable force. Even if some anomaly in a grotto heaven occurred, the family would receive news and understand the inside story, ensuring they wouldn't unwittingly send someone into danger.
In contrast, the obvious Bright Yang Wei-Li bloodline was highly coveted by Buddhist cultivators. However, the high-ranking Buddhist cultivators couldn't enter their territory easily. Compared to the greed of Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, their danger was much less pressing.
Seeing that everyone had taken his words to heart, Li Xuanfeng nodded and said, "Between two evils, choose the lesser. Regardless of whether this child bears a thread of fate, his identity as a child of the Wei-Li bloodline remains. He will be the young master of the Li Family."
"Young master…" Li Xuanxuan glanced at Li Chengliao, who looked somewhat awkward, and suggested softly, "Chengliao is the current young master. Why not follow the ancient system and call him heir apparent instead?"
"Indeed." As soon as this was settled, Li Ximing lifted his sleeve and retrieved a small jade bottle, saying, "Back in the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, Brother Zhi acquired a few alchemy recipes. One of them mentioned the Three Aspects Breaking Realm Pill, whose refined Profound Pill greatly aids in breaking through the Foundation Establishment Realm."
"I have studied it for several years and finally succeeded in refining one." He opened the bottle to reveal a perfectly round, crimson pill that glowed with a gem-like luster. The moment the bottle was uncorked, a pure fragrance rushed out, refreshing the mind and calming the spirit.
Li Ximing closed the bottle carefully and offered, "This pill will be of immense use in breaking through the Foundation Establishment Realm. Granduncle, since you are heading to the Southern Border, why not take one with you?"
Li Xuanfeng paused slightly before nodding in acknowledgment, "To refine a pill that aids in breaking through Foundation Establishment Realm, even the Azure Pond Sect has only a handful of alchemists who can manage it. Your skill in alchemy is truly commendable. However, I have my own arrangements for the Southern Border. Leave it here for family use."
His words were decisive and firm, carrying undeniable authority. Seeing this, Li Ximing had no choice but to stow the bottle away. Li Xuanfeng thought for a moment, then reached into his robe and retrieved three arrow shafts.
The arrows were pitch black, about the length of a forearm, with no arrowheads. Four golden feathers adorned their ends, and upon closer inspection, faint runes seemed to flicker along the shafts.
Handing the arrows to his elder brother, Li Xuanxuan, Li Xuanfeng instructed solemnly, "Keep these three arrows here. If anything urgent arises, snap one in half. I will sense it immediately and should be able to reach the family within two or three days."
Such warning artifacts were not uncommon, but they were difficult to preserve for long. Even their family's life jade—used to signify life or death—needed to be worn close to the body and replaced yearly. Li Xuanxuan nodded and asked, "How long will they last?"
Li Xuanfeng explained, "I crafted these during my leisure time over the past few months. Normal spiritual power or mana would not last long, so I condensed them using astral gold. They should remain effective for up to five years. By then, I will send back replacements."
In truth, Daoist Master Yuan Su had warned him not to visit home too frequently. Li Xuanfeng, however, kept this to himself, thinking, If I told my elder brother what Yuan Su said, he would surely refuse to use the arrows out of concern for burdening me. That could delay critical matters.
Li Xuanxuan clicked his tongue in admiration and carefully stored the three arrows. Li Xuanfeng glanced at the sky, calculated with his fingers, and said with some regret, "The time to leave is near. I must be on my way."
He stepped out into the courtyard, pulling a small jade boat from his belt. Tossing it into the air, he turned back to remind them, "If anything arises at home, send me a letter. Things are much more convenient now compared to before."
The group nodded, watching the jade-green spirit boat disappear into the radiant sunset. The boat, borrowed from Ning Wan, was incredibly fast and vanished in the blink of an eye.
In no time, only the sky remained, adorned with golden clouds, crimson-orange sunlight, and dazzling radiance that stretched across the heavens.
In his swaddling clothes, Li Zhouwei fixed his gaze on the setting sun, his amber-gold eyes reflecting its golden-red brilliance. The harmony between his gaze and the sun's hues was breathtaking and otherworldly.
After seeing Li Xuanfeng off, the crowd gradually dispersed. Li Chengliao smiled as he carried the child back to his courtyard.
His wife, Madam Hu, lay sound asleep. Although she was a Qi Cultivator, the birth of the child had drained her completely, leaving her physically and spiritually exhausted. She had taken some elixirs and was recuperating in their chambers.
His father, Li Xicheng, followed him into the courtyard, his face beaming with joy. He stroked his beard and couldn't take his eyes off the child in Li Chengliao's arms. Shutting the door behind them, Li Xicheng smiled as he looked at the baby repeatedly before sighing softly, "If only your great-grandfather were still alive, perhaps he could finally find peace…"
Great-grandfather Li Yuanyun was one of the rare mortals within the family's direct bloodline. His life had been one of hardship and instability, and even his death brought little comfort. Although Li Xicheng eventually ascended to the position of family head, he could never let go of his father's suffering.
Li Chengliao gently consoled him, "It is all in the past now… let us look forward to the future."
Azure Pond Sect.
Snow had piled up thickly in the forests of Qingsui Peak. The pavilions were silent and empty. A woman draped in Daoist robes sat on a bamboo platform, resting her chin in her hands.
Her features were somewhat ordinary, but the luxurious Dharma robe she wore added a touch of elegance to her appearance. The cultivation aura around her lent her a refined and ethereal air.
This woman was Yang Xiao'er, and whenever she emerged from seclusion, she would sit here and look down. From this vantage point, she could see the colorful rainbow light rising from the cave dwelling on the mountainside. Her Dao companion, Li Xizhi, was undergoing Foundation Establishment Realm breakthrough within.
The radiant light floated upward above the cave and alternated between six vibrant colors before turning into a rainbow-colored mist that fell gently to the ground. This was the mystical Six-Colored Rainbow Mist, which she had specially borrowed for this occasion.
