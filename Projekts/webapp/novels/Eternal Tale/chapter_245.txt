The following month, Chen Xun, stealing some free time, snuck off alone to the giant ship anchored at the island's edge.
"Little Crane, your big brother is here to see you again." Chen Xun instinctively patted the tree trunk and leaned against it, leisurely taking in the view of the Forbidden Sea.
A gentle sea breeze blew past, rippling the faint light on the dark sea. The Forbidden Sea emanated an indescribable mysterious vitality, giving one a deep, transcendent feeling.
Chen Xun's gaze gradually softened, and past events faded away, just like the countless waves, leaving no trace behind.
He felt a bit homesick. Even though he lived in the Great Li Realm now, it never felt quite like Qian Nation. If the Great Li Realm were to be destroyed, he wouldn't hesitate to escape with his two brothers without any resistance.
"The Tian Duan Plains—there's still no way to solve it." Chen Xun lightly shook his head. The problem that had plagued The Great Li Realm for so many years couldn’t possibly be solved by him alone. "One step at a time, just do your best."
He looked up at the Crane Spirit Five Elements Tree, which had over a thousand storage rings hanging deep within its lush branches like windchimes, creating a striking sight.
After years of cultivation, the tree was now over 500,000 years old, having become quite extraordinary. It had even started developing some offensive abilities, though it had never shown them.
"Little Crane, I know that one day you’ll develop intelligence." Chen Xun’s gaze was unusually calm. "Along the way, we've long considered you a brother. I hope that when you take on human form, we won’t become enemies."
As soon as he said this, the sea breeze suddenly grew much colder, and the surrounding spiritual energy and mist seemed to tremble.
Rustling sounds followed.
The Crane Tree emitted a soft glow and began swaying gently, though there was no wind, radiating a peaceful aura.
"I'm just joking, my brother," Chen Xun chuckled to himself, and the space inside the giant ship returned to normal. "If we truly nurture an immortal species, I, the Ancestor, will not treat you poorly."
The Crane Tree became still again. Even when the wind blew, its black-and-white leaves didn’t move. Every month, Chen Xun would sit under the tree, muttering to himself, saying things even the big black ox and Little Red didn’t know about.
After half a day, he stopped rambling.
Chen Xun ran his hand along the ship’s hull, feeling a bit sentimental. With the nurturing of various essence energies, the ship's body had become increasingly sturdy, perfectly attuned to the world's five elemental forces, and its speed was gradually improving.
However, due to their focus on cultivating spiritual herbs, they had somewhat neglected the ship. Still, with another million years of nurturing, Chen Xun was confident it could ram ancient warships, leaving them with gaping holes.
"War Realm Camp." He held a token in his hand. Over the years, he had discovered that when he touched it with spiritual power, the token would react.
However, the big black ox had already examined the token and found no formations or restrictions on it—its material was simply unique, with no other function.
Yet something strange happened right in broad daylight. The token seemed to act like a compass, pointing in a direction deep within the Forbidden Sea, beyond the seven ancient secret realms.
What lay there? The ancient relics provided only fragmented clues, all of which summarized one conclusion—certain death!
"Tian Duan Plains, the monk of Chan Yin Temple, the millennium-old Heavenly Path, the Water Spirit Art, the Filthy Longevity Technique, the Plan to Ascend to Godhood!" Chen Xun’s gaze turned deep as he stared at the sea, tightly clutching the token in his hand. "Without the power of godhood, it would be unwise to proceed. I wonder if the overseas have a way to slip through."
They held an earth-shattering secret. In the Great Li Realm, where god-like figures resided, they had to be cautious and deliberate, ensuring they could survive.
"Hmm, we shouldn’t interact too much with the Yu family. Once our objective is achieved, we must retreat quickly." Chen Xun took out a small notebook and began writing, "The lives of the four of us are in my hands. One wrong step, and it’s eternal doom."
His aura began to rise, becoming increasingly transcendent as he started calculating various possibilities.
One by one, earth-shattering plans took shape in the small notebook. If anyone were to see them, they would undoubtedly be shocked; these plans would be highly coveted.
The soft glow emitted by the Crane Tree became increasingly sharp, as if guarding the figure beneath it.
Meanwhile, in the island's central mining pit:
"Brother Ox, this is a rich vein! Who knows how much this ore would fetch in The Great Li Realm." Little Red let out a delighted roar. They had already earned over five million mid-grade spirit stones by performing ceremonies for the relics they collected. "We’re no longer lacking in cultivation resources—we can buy anything we want!"
"Moo~~" The big black ox let out a perfunctory call, its gaze shifting to the coastline. Chen Xun was definitely hiding many things from it.
Throughout their journey, though Chen Xun often appeared carefree, when it came to making plans, the big black ox only admired its elder brother.
In such a dangerous cultivation world, they had prospered relying on their five-element spiritual roots, evading countless disasters along the way.
"Brother Ox, Brother Xun probably just went to rest," Little Red said with a wide grin, still slapping chunks of ore. "When Brother Xun returns, we’ll show him what we’ve harvested."
The big black ox shook its head, exhaling through its nose. Little Red didn’t understand Chen Xun at all.
Little Red froze, casting a meaningful glance toward the coastline. Brother Xun was indeed a very special person. Even after hundreds of years together, it still couldn’t fully understand him.
"Moo!" The big black ox hopped onto Little Red’s back and slapped it with a hoof. Time to get back to work.
“Roar!”
Little Red leapt far, skillfully avoiding several mining tunnels, places where Brother Xun had been working. Moving around recklessly would surely get it scolded.
The next day, Chen Xun returned, riding a beam of light, and once again plunged into the mining tunnels to continue excavating the Starshifting Blackstone.
They had even decided to dig three feet deep, unwilling to let heaven’s gift slip by—a sign of respect toward the heavens.
...
A year later, the giant ship on the coast set sail. Three figures stood atop the crane-shaped bow, gazing into the distance.
Today, outside the Forbidden Sea, a massive fleet was cutting through the waves, and among the flags was the symbol of one of the three great ancient cultivation families: the Yu family.
The crashing waves resembled an iron cavalry, charging forward with thunderous roars, filling the air with a chilling sense of dread.
"It’s the Yu family, and they’ve sent so many people this time."
"Those don’t look like the Yu family’s disciples; they’ve brought many protectors."
"Heh, with the Seven Ancient Secret Realms open year-round, how could these ancient cultivation families resist?"
Voices buzzed across the sea as various forces turned their eyes toward the massive fleet, puzzled by why the Yu family had dispatched so many people.
There was an unspoken rule in the Forbidden Sea: the more cultivators there were, the more the legacy would gather, and the greater the danger they would face.
Moreover, the ancient secret realms were never about who brought the most people—it was about one's own fortune. No matter how many cultivators entered the vast realms, most would end up as mere skeletons.
A powerful cold snort rang out from the fleet, startling many cultivators into silence, unwilling to speak further.
"Ignore them," Yu Chen said, his gaze never lingering on the various factions' fleets. "Proceed cautiously in the Forbidden Sea."
"Yes, Young Master!"
A loud response echoed from the fleet as it began to split into two sections, forming a black line that divided the Western Sea and the Demon Nest, while the sky grew increasingly dim.
They entered the Forbidden Sea, with everyone on high alert, watching the surrounding mist and vapor.
Yu Chen held a sound transmission jade slip in his hand, but it was one-way. He had studied the object upon returning to his family, and its craftsmanship was too unique to be touched by anyone below the Golden Core stage.
His injuries had mostly healed by now, and the Yu family never lacked rare medicinal treasures for recovery. What they lacked were the priceless resources to enhance cultivation.
"Is it still the same direction?" Uncle Chu asked in a low voice. "Have those three communicated with you?"
"No," Yu Chen replied calmly, showing no sense of urgency.
Behind him was an elderly man who appeared to be dozing off, his eyelids drooping, hands tucked into his sleeves as though he were at death’s door.
Yet the man’s body was surging with the power of a god-slaying force, not dependent on any artifact. It was exceedingly eerie.
Three days into their voyage, a giant ship appeared faintly within the mist, with a massive tree towering over it, blocking out the sky in the hazy distance.
"Slow down!"
"Slow down!"
Yu Chen and the old man shouted simultaneously. The fleet rumbled to a halt, obeying their orders without question.
Yu Chen's eyes gleamed with joy. The silhouette of this giant ship was unmistakably that of the three predecessors' vessel—he was certain of it.
However, the sleepy old man suddenly became alert, his eyes flashing with sharpness as though facing a great threat. The appearance of this giant ship was too strange, and atop it surged... a truly terrifying god-killing force!
