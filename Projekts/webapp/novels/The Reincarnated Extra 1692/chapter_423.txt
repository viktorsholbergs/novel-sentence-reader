Funeral, Meeting, Urgent Report
* * *
Kobdalian, with a solemn expression, released a small fireball from his mouth.
A fireball created using his supernatural ability, 【Raging Flames】.
He’s on a rest day, but he can still use this level of power without any problem.
And that fireball flew straight… and hit the battered corpse of a Red Kobu warrior, setting it ablaze.
This warrior was a veteran Kobudai who acted as the rearguard during their escape from the monster.
Covered in wounds from the monster’s tentacle attack… he somehow managed to reach the village… but that was his limit.
He must have been swimming with only his willpower, gravely injured.
As soon as he reached the village, and saw Clan Chief Kobdalian’s face…
He threw himself onto the ground and stopped moving.
This… is a warrior’s funeral.
The warrior’s remains, enveloped in Kobdalian’s 【Raging Flames】, were quickly burned to ashes.
The smell of his burning scales and fins, and his flesh…
The heat penetrated evenly throughout his body.
<<<Oh, our god, Godkob! Guide the soul of this brave warrior, to the Mother Sea!>>>
Kobdalian said solemnly, closing his eyes.
The other warriors followed suit.
The sound of sobs could be heard from the shadows of the rocks in the village.

<<<Now then, let’s hear the story again. About that… monster… that suddenly appeared on the battlefield.>>>
A few minutes later.
Kobdalian was holding a meeting, sitting in a circle with the warriors.
He’s the Clan Chief… who has to lead the village and continue fighting.
He can’t afford to be sentimental forever.
<<<The possibility of that monster being a new weapon of the Black Kobu… is low… right?>>>
<<<Yes.>>>
Kobdaroze nodded at Kobdalian’s question.
<<<After all, that monster seemed to be attacking the Black Kobu more than us. Well, I think it’s because those guys provoked it…>>>
Kobdaroze said that, shivering as he recalled the terrifying figure of the monster.
Two arms, two legs, and hair flowing from its head.
That grotesque figure, far removed from that of a fish.
Just imagining it… made him feel like his mind was being eroded.
<<<Ah… but knowing ‘Kobdarok, the Merciless’, the Clan Chief of the Black Kobu Tribe… there’s a possibility that he led that monster onto the battlefield, disregarding the casualties on his own side… >>>
Another veteran Red Kobu warrior, Kobdaold, added to the trembling Kobdaroze’s words.
<<<But, even so… that means they don’t have complete control over that monster…>>>
<<<That’s right. We can’t say anything for sure at this point.>>>
<<<Strengthen our vigilance. Is that all we can do…? >>>
The Black Kobu Tribe in the west has been quite active recently.
Skirmishes over territory are frequent.
The Blue Kobu Tribe in the south, although small in number, is not a force that can be ignored.
And on top of that… a monster of unknown origin has appeared.
Kobdalian couldn’t help but sigh at the troublesome situation.
<<<If only I was stronger…>>>
Kobdaroze, seeing Kobdalian like that, muttered involuntarily.
He wants to be stronger.
As a warrior, stronger, stronger…
He’s still so inexperienced.
Since facing that monster today… Kobdaroze has completely lost his confidence.
How weak he is…
As a warrior… he has to protect everyone in the village…
He has to protect Kobdalian…
<<<Don’t dwell on it alone, Kobdaroze. Everyone feels frustrated by their own weakness.>>>
But here, Kobdaroze, who was lost in thought, was startled by those words, looked up from his downcast face.
The one who spoke, standing before his eyes, was… the young Clan Chief, Kobdalian.
<<<That’s why… We’ll become stronger together. The Red Kobu Tribe… together! >>>
Kobdalian, although his face looked a little tired… said that and smiled powerfully.
Seeing that smile… Kobdaroze’s cheeks, already red, blushed even more.
<<<…Ahhh! If only I was still female! I’d become your bride, Clan Chief!>>>
Kobdaroze, embarrassed, deliberately shouted that, spun around, and winked at Kobdalian.
<<<Hahaha! What are you saying, Kobdaroze! Even the Clan Chief has the right to choose!? >>>
<<<Yeah! You should stop eating rocks, mistaking them for turban shells, before trying to act cute!>>>
<<<Aaaaah!? What are you saying, you old geezersss! I’ll beat you uuuup!?>>>
Kobdaroze puffed up his cheeks in anger at the veteran warriors who teased him with their jeers.
Laughter filled the meeting place.
<<<It’s terribleーーー!!>>>
But that cheerful atmosphere didn’t last long.
A young Kobudai… flew into the meeting place, gasping for air, with a desperate expression.
<<<Hey, what’s wrong!?>>>
<<<Calm down! Take a breath and speak slowly!>>>
<<<Haa! Haa!>>>
The young Kobudai, whose hump had just begun to grow, took a few rough breaths, as the warriors patted his back with their fins.
And then, he looked at Kobdalian and shouted…
<<<The Black Kobu Tribe… they attacked our ranch!!>>>
