"This formation is the only thing that makes that demon wary… I truly have nowhere else to go," Zhong Qian said, glancing at Li Xuanfeng's expression as he subtly flattered him. He then removed a storage pouch from his waist and offered it with both hands. "This contains everything I took from the demon's cave dwelling. I am willing to give it all back to you, Senior."
Li Xuanfeng glanced at it, but since he had no way of knowing what arrangements Yuan Su might have made, he didn't open it. He waved his hand and said, "Keep it. Whatever you have obtained is yours."
Zhong Qian looked at him incredulously. Noticing the stern expression and fierce aura of Li Xuanfeng, he felt he was beginning to understand his character and respectfully replied, "As you command, Senior."
After a brief, uncomfortable pause, he lowered his voice further. "It is just… I would like to stay on this island for a while longer… If I were to leave now, I fear I would fall victim to that demon."
He quickly added, "I will not stay here for free. Whatever damage that demon has caused… I am willing to compensate fully."
"No need." Li Xuanfeng responded simply, causing Zhong Qian's face to flicker with surprise before Li Xuanfeng added, almost casually, "I will leave the island to kill it myself. You may go freely afterward."
"What?!" Zhong Qian looked at him, stunned. He took in the imposing figure clad in black-gold armor, the sharp, cold gaze, and the exaggerated longbow on his back, shaped almost like a pair of eagle wings. He murmured to himself, "Who… which killer from the devil gate is this…? How domineering…"
Zongquan Island.
Over the years, Zongquan Island had flourished, with new palaces and formations built, and a growing number of cultivators. Thanks to the resources and inheritances Li Yuanjiao had left behind before going into seclusion, the island had accumulated wealth and was thriving.
Atop a high mountain on the island, a stone door remained tightly closed, while springs trickled gently. At dawn, a pale blue mist would rise from the mountain, drifting down in delicate showers. This phenomenon, caused by a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator's seclusion, had led the island residents to name the mountain Morning Mist Mountain.
With a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator guarding it, the island's people finally felt like a true community rather than transient visitors. Each morning, as they looked up to see the soft blue mist, men, women, and children alike felt a comforting peace.
Time in the mountains passed unnoticed. After three years in seclusion, Li Yuanjiao's sea of qi had grown dense and powerful, swirling upward and coalescing into two fierce water dragons that danced and coiled within his sea of qi.
"Mid-Foundation Establishment Realm… success." He took a deep breath, feeling refreshed. Ordinarily, with his temperament, Li Yuanjiao would have sought out a blessed land for a decade or two of cultivation after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm. However, he didn't have that luxury now.
The breakthrough had not been difficult. Li Yuanjiao was, after all, a prodigy who reached the Foundation Establishment Realm at forty. The Boundless Ocean, or the Jing Dragon King, progressed swiftly in the Eastern Sea, and advancing to mid-Foundation Establishment Realm was almost natural for him.
"Mid-Foundation Establishment Realm… my mana has doubled, and now I can summon two water dragons…" Li Yuanjiao took a moment to assess his abilities, feeling reasonably satisfied. The River One Qi Technique was only a Grade Three technique. While it had given him an advantage over other rogue cultivators at the Qi Cultivation Realm, he found himself competing against immortal gate disciples at the Foundation Establishment Realm, where the technique's shortcomings became apparent.
In Jiangnan, immortal gate disciples usually cultivated Grade Four techniques, while true disciples and Purple Mansion Realm heirs practiced Grade Five or even Grade Six arts. Li Yuanjiao's Grade Three technique meant his foundation's profundity would inevitably fall short in comparison.
Unbothered, Li Yuanjiao emerged from his cave dwelling. Waiting outside the stone door was Zong Yan and his entourage. Seeing the phenomenon on the mountain dissipate, Zong Yan knew Li Yuanjiao had emerged from seclusion and stood respectfully outside.
Nearby stood a thin-faced monk with modest attire and pale lips, who offered a soft smile and said, "Congratulations, Senior!"
Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly, noting that Kongheng's aura had also improved. He returned the sentiment with a polite "Congratulations to you as well," then took to the air. Outside, the island was lively and full of vitality.
Li Yuanjiao scanned his surroundings but saw no temples or statues. Looking at Kongheng beside him, he raised his brow slightly in surprise and remarked quietly, "Quite the immortal atmosphere."
For years, he had left the island to its own devices, with Kongheng, a Master Monk, overseeing it. He had expected the island to be filled with temples upon his return, so he was somewhat taken aback. Zong Yan, perceptive to his reaction, spoke softly, "Master Monk Kongheng does not establish temples… We have even tried to persuade him… suggesting he could at least create a golden statue for people to worship, but…"
Over the years, Kongheng had gained considerable respect on the island, tending to the sick and healing injuries. Many of the island's residents wanted to erect a golden statue of him and build a temple in his honor, but he refused each offer.
Observing Li Yuanjiao and his attendant discussing the matter, Kongheng murmured, "To build a grand statue gilded in gold is to instill fear in the people with an imposing image, and to construct large temples is to deceive the masses with rituals and incense offerings. These are things we of the Liao River Temple abstain from."
Li Yuanjiao pondered this and, glancing at Kongheng, asked, "Then how does the Master Monk pass down his teachings?"
Kongheng narrowed his eyes slightly. The past few years of performing good deeds on the island seemed to have furthered his cultivation. Pressing his palms together, he replied in a soft voice, "The Dharma of the Revered One requires no transmission, no form, no scripture. Those who observe me with wisdom will receive the teachings of my Liao River Temple. We of the Liao River do not bow to others; we cultivate our own nature."
Zong Yan, stroking his beard thoughtfully as he listened, murmured, "Master Monk… it is no wonder that the Liao River Dao lineage has gradually fallen out of favor. In these times… everyone seeks a quick and effective method to progress each day. The Liao River's teachings… alas!"
Zong Yan gave a wry smile. He had a foster son who admired Kongheng and had wanted to become his disciple, so Zong Yan had approached Kongheng several times to learn more. Shaking his head, he added, "The Liao River Dao lineage is truly too difficult… I have heard that cultivators of the Seven Worldly Ways need only chant the Maha incantation once to gain progress in their cultivation, while the Liao River requires one to fully experience the myriad forms of human nature just to begin. How can it compare?"
Kongheng remained silent, only smiling with lowered eyes. Li Yuanjiao was reminded of the northern Wang Family's sword immortals; he had heard that their Dao lineage was similarly demanding. Deciding not to dwell on it, he changed the subject and asked, "Has something happened? Why is the sky so dark and overcast, stretching for thousands of li?"
As far as he could see, the skies were filled with dense, dark clouds. Zong Yan shook his head and replied, "How could we know about such matters? Zongquan Island is in a remote area, and we rarely visit the market, so we are unlikely to hear any news."
Li Yuanjiao extended his spiritual sense, and two blue water dragons spiraled beneath his feet as he carefully sensed the environment. He noticed that the flow of his Immortal Foundation energy was slightly less smooth and efficient than it had been in previous years. Previously, cultivation here in the Eastern Sea was more than five percent faster than in Jiangnan… but now it is barely half that.
Riding the wind, he looked at the lightning flickering among the clouds. Zong Yan continued, "Huiyao, visited about half a year ago, claiming it came to gather information. We told it that you were in seclusion and sent it away."
"Not long ago, another cultivator arrived, claiming to be from the mainland… and delivered a letter." He took a letter from his sleeve, which Li Yuanjiao accepted with a nod. The creature had benefited from his favor and influence and even remembered to pay its respects. Li Yuanjiao used a secret technique to unlock the letter and began to read it closely.
