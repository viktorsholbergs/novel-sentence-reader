After nearly half a year of construction, the formation on Mount Lijing was finally completed by the end of the year. Eight high platforms were erected, standing out strikingly on the two peaks.
Liu Changdie breathed a sigh of relief and went to find Li Xuanxuan for the formation flags.
The formation flags were naturally prepared by the Li Family, and their quality would determine the effectiveness of the formation.
Liu Changdie had already discussed this matter with Li Xuanxuan early on, but he kept them hidden and delayed revealing them.
As soon as he entered the courtyard, Liu Changdie saw Li Xuanxuan wearing a simple leather outfit. He was drawing symbols on a large pear wood table using cloth as a base and diluted ink, giving it a very light appearance.
Liu Changdie was curious but figured that it was probably someone else's cultivation secret and dared not pry.
Beside the table stood a child about four or five years old, silently observing Li Xuanxuan's actions. He appeared to be quite well-behaved.
"Brother Xuanxuan!" Liu Changdie called out and saw Li Xuanxuan nod slightly and smile at him. Liu Changdie found this rather odd.
In his previous life, Liu Changdie did not meet Li Xuanxuan or anyone from the Xuan generation in the Li family. His understanding of Li Xuanxuan was limited to what Li Yuanjiao mentioned, who used to dismissively say, "My old man... He’s boring! There’s nothing interesting about him!"
Liu Changdie just laughed, not daring to respond. After spending over a year with Li Xuanxuan, he had come to his own conclusion.
"Although serious and seldom seen smiling, he’s diligent and deeply cares for his family without indulging in frivolity or luxury... it is quite admirable."
Noticing the boy beside the table, Liu Changdie smiled slightly and his curiosity got the better of him.
"This is...?"
"This is my legitimate son, named Li Yuanxiu," Li Xuanxuan replied, lifting Li Yuanxiu gently.
Liu Changdie nodded as if he had just realized something. After a few moments of contemplation, he moved on to the main topic and reported, "I've finished engraving the formation patterns on the eight platforms… We can start setting up the formation now."
Li Xuanxuan was visibly pleased and, with a slap on his storage pouch, twelve small flags with white patterns and black cloth flew out immediately. They circled in the air before landing in Li Xuanxuan's outstretched palm.
Before he could speak, Liu Changdie, fixated on the flags, exclaimed, "White Feather Purple Flags!"
Li Xuanxuan was taken aback, knowing the flags were precious but not expecting such a reaction from Liu Changdie. Seeing his intense interest, he nodded in confirmation.
"Indeed, they are."
Liu Changdie eagerly took them, examining them with great appreciation and fascination.
"Wan Huaqian was renowned throughout Lixia Prefecture for these flags… Rumor has it they were sold to a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in Azure Pond Sect. How did your family acquire them?"
Li Xuanxuan smiled awkwardly.
“The Lu Family conquered Mount Huaqian and obtained these flags… then sold them to us."
"So, it never left Mount Huaqian… That news was a decoy!" Liu Changdie realized, showing a trace of regret, and continued, "I’ve only seen Mount Huaqian from a distance. Wan Huaqian's ability to set up a formation that could withstand a peak Qi Cultivator’s attack with such a small and flawed mountain proves his superior formation talents!"
Li Xuanxuan smiled and consoled him saying, "Once the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation is complete, it can also resist the assaults of peak Qi Cultivators, no less impressive than Wan Huaqian’s formation."
"It's not the same."
Liu Changdie shook his head and sighed.
"We built eight high platforms. Did you see any high platforms or formation pools on Mount Huaqian? It shows Wan Huaqian's innate talent for formations."
After finishing the conversation, Liu Changdie, with a smile, offered a suggestion to Li Xuanxuan.
“Let’s not waste any more time. Let’s get started.”
He then sat cross-legged and performed a series of hand seals, sending the twelve White Feather Purple Flags soaring into the air. Dividing into two groups, they flew north and south, settling into their respective positions on the high platforms. The formation patterns on the platforms lit up at once, emitting streaks of dazzling golden light.
Almost immediately, Mount Lijing and Mount Meiche, bathed in golden brilliance— began quaking slightly.
The workers and irrelevant people had already been evacuated to the foot of the mountain as streams of light and golden luminescence engulfed the mountain.
Liu Changdie sat cross-legged, adjusting his breath for a period equivalent to the time taken for an incense stick to burn.
Eventually, a grand formation—gleaming with golden light—manifested atop the mountain. It was spectacular under the sunlight.
"Mission accomplished!" Liu Changdie exhaled deeply and nodded slightly.
Li Tongya, who had just walked into the courtyard, was greeted promptly by the two.
"Senior!"
"Your efforts are much appreciated!"
Li Tongya responded with an affirming nod, expressing his satisfaction with the formation.
Li Xuanxuan understood immediately and tapped his storage pouch. Almost at once, a heap of pristine, jade-like Spirit Stones clinked onto the table.
"Here are one hundred Spirit Stones. Please, feel free to count them."
After quickly counting them with his spiritual sense, Lu Changdie pretended to be generous and waved dismissively.
"There's no need to count them."
With a wave of his hand, the Spirit Stones on the table vanished, and he announced with a smile, "Now that the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation is complete, I shall return to the prefecture. Should I visit Mount Lijing in the future, I hope Brother Xuanxuan won't turn me away!"
"Of course not!" Li Xuanxuan assured, shaking his head. "Should Brother Changdie visit, I will personally welcome you!" he added with a grin.
Liu Changdie laughed heartily then respectfully bid farewell to Li Tongya. He then departed from the Li Family, heading toward Lixia Prefecture. Li Xuanxuan escorted him to the edge of Li Family’s territory before returning home.
Li Tongya stood in front of a pear wood desk, carefully examining the symbols on the fabric.
Li Yuanxiu, standing timidly by his side, fixated on the sword at Li Tongya's waist. Li Tongya looked down at him with a gentle smile and asked softly, "What's your name?"
"Li Yuanxiu."
His response was soft, prompting Li Tongya to say with a smile, "You can call me grand-uncle then."
"Grand-uncle!"
Li Yuanxiu's jovial call seemed to bring him closer to the man before him, easing the nervousness caused by his father's absence. He hugged Li Tongya's leg and reached out to grasp at the sword sheath hanging by his waist.
Li Jingtian descended the mountain, wearing a white veiled hat. She was followed by several clan guards along the stone path, and they arrived at a grand courtyard.
The entrance, with its blue bricks and black tiles and majestic architecture, was immaculately clean.
As she stepped onto the stone steps, two clan guards approached her. They inquired respectfully, "Who might you be?"
At this, Li Jingtian's guards immediately stepped forward, reproaching, "What are you doing? Don't you recognize her?! Who are you to stop her?!"
Li Jingtian gestured for them to stop and lifted her veil slightly. The guards were immediately taken aback by shock and stepped aside.
Li Jingtian then softly said, "Take me to your Seventh Madam."
"Right away!"
The guards guided Li Jingtian through the lacquered red corridors, arriving at a courtyard where a lady in fine clothes was pruning plants.
Upon seeing a group escorting Li Jingtian, she appeared slightly startled and uncertain.
"Who might you be?" the Seventh Madam asked inquisitively.
Only after Li Jingtian removed her veil did Mu Yalu immediately kneel in greeting.
“My lady."
"There's no need for formalities."
Li Jingtian smiled gently and graciously, exchanging a few pleasantries with Mu Yalu before moving on to discuss recent events.
She then looked at the child in Mu Yalu's arms and said with a smile, "Let me take a look at Jiao’er."
Mu Yalu, a bit startled, smiled reluctantly and handed the child over to her. Li Jingtian took him carefully, cradling him with a radiant smile on her face.
After carefully examining the child's eye color and seeing that it was indeed a deep black, she sighed in relief.
Then, wanting to clarify something she had heard, she gently asked Mu Yalu, "I've heard that your family has some blood relation with the… former Mount Yue lord— Jianixi?"
This question struck Mu Yalu like thunder, causing a flood of panic and fear.
As she saw Li Yuanjiao still in Li Jingtian's arms, she immediately knelt down trembling, vehemently denying the accusation.
"This must be slander! Jianixi was born a slave, while we are a family of shamans passed down through generations of lords! How could we be related?! My lady… someone must be slandering us!"
