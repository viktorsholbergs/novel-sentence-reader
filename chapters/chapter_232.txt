Chen Donghe landed at the foot of Cloud Crowned Peak, where a cold wind rustled through the pines and cypresses. He took a few steps forward and caught sight of a middle-aged man dressed in a gray robe, sweeping the stone path. The broom gently brushed the ground as Chen Donghe approached him.
"Please deliver a message… Tell them that Chen Donghe of the Li Family has come to visit and would like to see Senior Xiao Yongling."
The man in front of him straightened up with a smile, carefully examined Chen Donghe, and replied, "Please wait a moment, Honored guest… I'll report this right away."
Soon, a small opening appeared in the formation, and Chen Donghe quickly entered. He climbed the stone steps to the small courtyard, where two potted dwarf pines stood by the entrance.
The middle-aged man bowed and left, while Chen Donghe gently pushed open the door to see Xiao Yongling. He wore a snow-white, long, straight-collared robe with a crescent-patterned sash around his waist, all exuding a luxurious aura. His long sword at his waist shone brilliantly, and he looked like he had just returned from elsewhere.
Chen Donghe was stunned into silence by Xiao Yongling's attire. In the past, Xiao Yongling hadn't worn dharma robes and had always been polite, so his family's wealth wasn't as apparent. Now, dressed in complete luxury, Chen Donghe felt a twinge of envy.
"Greetings, Senior!" he greeted respectfully.
"So it's you, young friend Donghe…" Xiao Yongling said as he nodded slightly and continued politely, "Does the Li Family need my assistance?"
"Not at all," Chen Donghe answered respectfully with a smile, "Our elder has achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, so I was sent here to share the good news!"
"What?! Tongya did?"
Xiao Yongling's expression changed dramatically as he heard this, and he tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword. His face went through several emotions before he finally sighed after a dozen breaths.
"Brother Tongya has ultimately bested me!" he exclaimed.
Years ago, when Xiao Yuansi had returned home, he told Xiao Yongling—then at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, that Li Tongya had reached the eighth layer. Xiao Yongling had lamented that Li Tongya was advancing faster than him and looked forward to seeing who would reach the Foundation Establishment Realm first.
Three years had passed since then. Xiao Yongling had taken spirit medicine and reached the ninth heavenly layer but still needed time to gather strength for a breakthrough. Meanwhile, Li Tongya had already achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm, leaving Xiao Yongling with a mix of emotions. His lingering discontent finally dissipated, turning into deep admiration.
"Everyone says Li Chejing had extraordinary talent but overlooked Brother Tongya. He may be quiet and steady, yet he's also a dragon among men!" Xiao Yongling sighed as he gazed into the distance.
He didn't know that Li Tongya had the assistance of talisman qi and talisman pills, believing that Li Tongya's independent training in the wilderness was faster than his own cultivation at Cloud Crowned Peak, even with spirit medicine. He let go of the competitive spirit and grew more composed.
Chen Donghe waited silently until Xiao Yongling came back to his senses and smiled warmly at him.
"Please congratulate Brother Tongya for me!"
Chen Donghe nodded with a bright smile, placing the gifts he carried on the table and explaining everything carefully.
Xiao Yongling immediately offered earnestly, "Please stay for a few days, my young friend. First, I need to discuss our families' marriage arrangement with our ancestors… Second, it is only right to follow proper etiquette. Brother Tongya's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm is a joyous occasion, and our Xiao Family must show our goodwill!"
"You're too kind, Senior!" Chen Donghe responded politely. After chatting with Xiao Yongling about the Li Family's current affairs, the latter waved for the middle-aged man to lead Chen Donghe to the guest room for a rest.
After Chen Donghe left, Xiao Yongling stroked his beard and nodded, a smile lingering on his face.
"Chen Donghe… Not bad at all."
The Xiao Family typically received guests at Cloud Crowned Peak, however, the main peak was over a hundred li eastward and deep within Lixia Prefecture, where a grand mountain called Mount Xianyou lay. Its slopes were broad and imposing.
Mount Xianyou was divided into two parts by a river known as the Yue River. It flowed swiftly, with boatmen often riding its currents from upstream, their songs echoing through the peaks in a captivating manner.
Xiao Yongling flew for an hour and landed between the peaks, where he saw a deep pond surrounded by cold mist. Two old men sat across from each other on a cliff, each holding a fishing rod and fishing in the pond below.
Xiao Yongling took a step forward and climbed the stone steps, approaching one of the old men. He whispered in his ear softly.
"Ancestor, Li Tongya has reached the Foundation Establishment Realm."
"Oh?"
The old man raised his eyebrows, and his fishing rod trembled slightly as he spoke softly, "That was quick… That boy must have had some fortuitous encounter."
Xiao Yongling nodded gently and replied respectfully, "Then, regarding the marriage arrangement…"
The other old man at the pond's edge also raised his head and smiled, "Chuting, I have met Li Tongya, and he is quite capable. In my opinion, we should marry one of our daughters to them and have them send one over to us… Both families will benefit from this arrangement."
Xiao Chuting nodded and raised his fishing rod. The water of the cold pond below exploded with a thunderous roar as the snowy water surged upward, climbing nearly halfway up the cliff before an invisible force pushed it back down, creating a crashing sound like thunder.
Boom!
As Xiao Chuting reeled in the rod, a shimmering silver dagger was pulled out. He raised his snowy-white eyebrow before grinning proudly.
"A fine catch!"
Xiao Yongling stood mesmerized, but Xiao Chuting waved his hand and said softly, "Let Yuansi handle this!"
Meanwhile, at Fei Residence on Glacial Cloud Peak…
The cool moonlight fell gently as Li Qinghong sat on a treetop, swinging her feet back and forth. The soft, pale moonlight enveloped her, highlighting her delicate face.
"Sister Qinghong!"
Fei Tongxiao took a few leaps through the woods and climbed up to the treetop. He walked along the branches with a bright smile and said eagerly, "Sister Qinghong, you seem in good spirits today to be moon-gazing today!"
"Junior Brother," Li Qinghong politely acknowledged him with a nod and asked, "Are you looking for me to practice spear?"
Fei Tongxiao hesitated briefly before stuttering, "N-No! Just moon-gazing… moon-gazing…"
Li Qinghong saw his expression and couldn't help but chuckle, leaving Fei Tongxiao momentarily dazed. His breath quickened, and his face flushed as he said softly, "Sister Qinghong, I..."
"Junior Brother…"
Li Qinghong stood up on the tree, shook her head, and smiled. "That's not right. Life is fleeting, and there is little time to admire the moon… We should spar instead. I have made progress this month, and you probably won't be able to beat me!" she teased, her eyes twinkling in the moonlight.
Fei Tongxiao was interrupted mid-sentence, his face turning pale. He looked downcast and conflicted, trying to muster the courage to speak, but Li Qinghong had already jumped down from the treetop. Her clear voice echoed through the woods.
"Junior Brother, let's go up the mountain and spar!"
Fei Tongxiao watched her disappear into the forest and bit his lip in frustration. He jumped down to the ground, where a group of Fei Family's disciples were gathered. One of them peeked out and remarked with some envy, "That rogue cultivator's daughter, Ye Qinghong, is really quite striking, and her figure is charming too… besides, she is already at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Brother Tongxiao has good taste!"
Fei Tongxiao glanced at him with irritation and shook a fist at him threateningly, which immediately sent the boys scattering off in all directions. Only a young man in white remained, leaning against a tree, looking down at Fei Tongxiao.
Fei Tongxiao whispered, "Brother Yu."
Fei Tongyu stood with his arms crossed and smiled softly, replying, "Fei Tongcai is not acting with good intentions, bringing those people to mock you… Li Qinghong saved your face, so do not bother her again."
Fei Tongxiao looked up indignantly and protested, "But I did not even say anything!"
Fei Tongyu shook his head, his eyes gleaming. When mentioning Li Qinghong, he spoke with admiration, "Some things remain unspoken yet are already asked, while others are left unsaid yet still answered. Li Qinghong is only sixteen, but she is both radiant and charming, cheerful and graceful. Yet, she is also measured and gentle… No wonder you are infatuated."
Fei Tongxiao felt both sad and angry, twisting his hands together. Fei Tongyu glanced at him and said with a smile, "Li Qinghong is stubbornly independent. If you cannot even beat her, how can you gain her respect? Focus on cultivating. Our Fei Family is full of refined gentlemen. Give it a few more years, and when you mature, no female cultivator will be able to resist you."
Fei Tongxiao was stunned and suddenly seemed to realize something, his face lighting up with joy. He nodded and laughed. "I understand now!"
He then rushed up the mountain, leaping through the forest after Li Qinghong. Fei Tongyu watched him disappear from view and chuckled, shaking his head. From behind a tree stepped out a middle-aged man, elegantly fanning himself. He was none other than their father, Fei Yihe.
"You always know what to do!" Fei Yihe praised him but heard no response. He turned to see his eldest son lost in thought.
Noticing his father's gaze, Fei Tongyu snapped out of his daze and looked up, asking, "What is it, Father?"
Fei Yihe felt uneasy seeing his eldest son so pensive and was worried that he might have missed something. He quickly asked in a low voice, "What have you so deep in thought? Is something wrong?"
Fei Tongyu laughed heartily and shook his head, saying, "Li Qinghong is certainly impressive and a direct daughter of the Li Family…"
Fei Yihe sighed and gritted his teeth, then pinched the bridge of his nose before kicking Fei Tongyu's leg, making him cry out in pain. He then scolded angrily, "Perish the thought!"
