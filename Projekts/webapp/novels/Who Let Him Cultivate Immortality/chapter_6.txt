Chapter 6: Senior Brother Dai, You Must Stay Calm
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou knelt on the ground, using the dagger to dig holes to bury the base of the ladder, then tamped down the soil to firm it up.
Lu Yang kicked the ladder to test its stability. It didn’t budge, instead sending a numbing vibration up his right foot.
“Not bad, very sturdy. I’ll try it first, then you can follow if I succeed.”
“Okay,” Meng Jingzhou nodded.
Lu Yang rubbed his hands together and briskly climbed the ladder. When he reached the corner of the ladder, parallel to the fiftieth step, he muttered ‘damn’ under his breath.
Forcing himself to look straight ahead and not down, he inched forward like a caterpillar.
Those on the steps watched Lu Yang approach the fiftieth step, stunned.
What they saw was astonishing: a giant ladder standing on the ground, with a ninety-degree bend, leading straight to the fiftieth step.
They had noticed Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou building the ladder but hadn’t paid much attention.
After all, they were struggling to reach the fortieth step themselves and couldn’t afford to be distracted by what seemed like a nonsensical endeavor.
Barbarian Bone, the fastest climber among them, had reached the forty-ninth step but found the fiftieth step insurmountable. It felt like carrying a mountain, almost crushing him.
Then, to his dismay, he watched Lu Yang pass by and reach the fiftieth step.
Lu Yang successfully passed the test, followed by Meng Jingzhou. The first and second to pass were determined.
…
Meanwhile, outside Heart-Seeking Mountain, the Dao Seeking Sect disciples were in a frenzy.
“You can’t stop me! I’m going to teach these two a lesson today, I promise not to kill them!” Dai Bufan was enraged, his muscles bulging like a bear robbed of its honey.
His junior brothers and sisters rushed to calm him down:
“Senior Brother Dai, you can’t do this!”
“Senior Brother Dai, you need to stay calm.”
“If something happens to the participants, our sect’s reputation will be tarnished!”
“Using force against the weak doesn’t look good, Senior Brother Dai!”
“Senior Brother Dai, remember, the third test is about the aspiration for Dao. You mustn’t get angry!”
Hearing the last remark, Dai Bufan calmed down.
Right, the third test was about aspiring for the Dao. Getting angry so easily wasn’t conducive to future cultivation.
“…Wait, the test is for them, not for me!”
The Dao Seeking Sect disciples once again descended into chaos.
Seeing this, the River Spirit felt somewhat appeased and retreated back into the river, no longer seeking trouble with the two.
…
Perhaps inspired by Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou’s successful collaboration, other participants shouted and cheered as they finally conquered the fiftieth step.
Barbarian Bone was the first, followed by others whom Lu Yang didn’t know. They were all those who had been behind Lu Yang, and he was unaware of their special talents. The last few to pass were familiar Double Spirit Root cultivators.
The remaining participants, unable to advance any further, attempted to descend and use the ladder created by Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou, only to find even descending exerted tremendous pressure. Their bodies couldn’t move up or down even one step.
“The third test is over. Those still on the mountain are disqualified,” Yun Zhi announced coldly, instructing Dai Bufan to bring the people down.
Heart-Seeking Mountain’s force, which reduced everyone to ordinary human capacity, couldn’t be removed, not even by Dai Bufan. To retrieve the people, he had to climb the mountain, enduring its pressure with each step.
Dai Bufan glared at Lu Yang before beginning his ascent.
He climbed effortlessly to the fiftieth step.
Those who had just passed the third test, seeing Dai Bufan’s ease compared to their own life-and-death struggle, felt a huge gap.
“It’s not hard to understand. You’re only fourteen or fifteen years old. Even with family support and early exposure to cultivation, it’s like chasing the moon’s reflection in water. You can’t truly comprehend what the Dao or immortality is.”
“Cultivation is also about cultivating the heart. When your practice matures, climbing Heart-Seeking Mountain will no longer be difficult.”
Concluding her explanation, Yun Zhi added as an afterthought, “Congratulations on becoming disciples of the Dao Seeking Sect.”
Yun Zhi waved her hand, and the bells on her wrist chimed, summoning mist that formed clouds to lift everyone up.
Lu Yang, standing on a cloud, watched the ground recede, swallowing nervously, his heart in his throat.
Mother, cultivation is thrilling.
Yun Zhi, standing on the cloud, addressed her junior brothers and sisters below, “Thank you for your hard work today. Once you’re done, you can continue with your duties.”
Her juniors replied in unison, “Yes,” and then started dismantling and transporting the ladder Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou had built.
A ladder on Heart-Seeking Mountain, what an oddity.
Lu Yang, unable to open his eyes on the cloud, heard others excitedly admiring the view. Overcome by curiosity, he opened his eyes and was stunned by the sight.
A majestic mountain stood in the center of surrounding peaks, reaching into the clouds, steep on all sides like a finely honed celestial sword. Eight mysterious mountains surrounded the central peak, with additional layers of mountains enclosing these core nine peaks.
The layers of mountains resembled a blooming lotus, captivating and awe-inspiring.
A hazy mist enshrouded the nine peaks, adding to their mystique.
Yun Zhi explained, “The core of the Dao Seeking Sect consists of nine peaks. The central peak, Heaven’s Gate Peak, is where our sect master resides. The other eight peaks belong to the eight elders, each with their own specialties. Accordingly, the functions of these peaks vary.”
“Besides these, other peaks are used for sect trials, extensions of the elders’ mountains, cultivation grounds for disciples, and dangerous areas where insufficient cultivation means certain death… It’s too much to explain in a few words. You can explore them gradually.”
“Cultivation values fate. You are free to roam the Dao Seeking Sect, visit peaks, the scripture library, or seek guidance from elder brothers and elders for the next month.”
“After one month, you must choose an elder as your master, provided the elder agrees to accept you as a disciple.”
Barbarian Bone asked without hesitation, “Can we choose only elders, or can we choose the sect master too?”
“You can, but the sect master rarely takes disciples. Your chances are slim.”
Despite Yun Zhi’s words, many were still eager to be disciples under the sect master.
As one of the five great immortal sects of the Central Continent, the sect master’s status and power were unquestionable, a rare match in the cultivation world. Becoming a disciple under such a figure had countless visible and hidden benefits.
“You’ll be guided to your respective caves shortly.”
“Lu Yang, Meng Jingzhou, stay behind.”
