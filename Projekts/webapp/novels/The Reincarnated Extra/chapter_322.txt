【Story of the Red-Haired Hero】 Rocked by the Waves
* * *
“…………”
The red-haired hero Torch stared intently at the vast ocean from the deck, his hair fluttering in the sea breeze under the clear sky.
He is currently standing on the ship operated by the brave captain Uminotoko.
The giant magical beast that appears in the coastal waters near Jabba-Jabba…… the Great Sea Serpent.
To exterminate this magical beast that makes people cower in fear.
For that purpose, Torch was waiting for the moment of confrontation.
“………… Ah, I caught one!”
The priest and healing arts practitioner Shiron was fishing.
……After all, it has already been…… several days since they boarded the ship to defeat the Great Sea Serpent.
At first, Shiron stood next to Torch and heightened her vigilance, but as expected, her concentration wore off.
Although they return to the port at night, it’s normal to get bored of continuing a staring contest with the vast ocean where nothing happens during the day.
Recently, her mind is filled with thoughts on how to catch delicious fish.
She became an apprentice to a master fisherman and is increasing her catch day by day.
The wandering mage Nenesane is also pondering something with her hand on her chin.
Today too, the Great Sea Serpent does not appear.
The hero’s party was simply…… rocked by the waves.
With this, Arc 16 comes to an end.
It was an episode where Emi-chan went on a rampage at the summer sea!
Did you enjoy it?
Now, the next arc is finally the final arc of Part 1!
Emi-chan is going to go on a rampage (isn’t that the usual?)!
I will start writing as soon as I’m ready, so I would be happy if you could accompany me in the next arc as well.
Thank you very much.
