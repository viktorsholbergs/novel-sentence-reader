The rear armies of the two nations began their final advance. Piercing screams, frenzied slaughter, and blazing flames of war fueled the soldiers' fury as the battle grew ever more ferocious.
Countless figures struggled and sank in the sea of blood, limbs like blades of grass, heads like stalks; a vast crimson prairie swept by a howling gale.
Chen Xun gripped his mighty axe, veins bulging on his forehead as he rode the big black ox, cutting through the enemy ranks like a force of nature. He charged in and out seven times, slaying all in his path!
Amidst the million-strong armies, the battlefield became a true meat grinder...
The pounding of hooves like rain, the battle cries like thunder, and the torrents of blood like rivers.
The white hair of a loving mother, a bride's longing gaze from her chamber, a child’s cries in the night, farewells under the willow shade of the hometown, the furious glare of a roaring general, and the abandoned banners of a defeated army—
all vanished in the swirling dust, wave after wave, drifting further away.
Chen Xun and the big black ox’s nation achieved a decisive victory. Many took note of them—brave and fearless, like natural-born warriors of the battlefield!
Yet, they did not ascend to the peak of glory, becoming a national general or marrying a noble princess. With no background or connections, even their military merits were embezzled.
Chen Xun remained a frontline soldier, though his sentence of exile to the border was pardoned—a not-too-bad outcome.
The war lasted three years in total, with their nation emerging victorious. The generals sang triumphant songs, and the country celebrated with amnesty for all.
Chen Xun and the big black ox obediently stayed at the border, hauling corpses and collecting bones.
They finally regained their freedom, returning to civilian life. On the battlefield, they had ‘picked up’ a fair amount of money, giving them a modest capital to start anew.
By his thirties, Chen Xun had grown a short, dark beard. His time on the battlefield had left him with a fierce aura, carrying an unmistakable air of fearless authority.
The duo became wanderers, settling in a new city where they started a small street stall. No longer daring to engage in illegal activities, they steered clear of the magistrate’s wrath.
Night, Western City, "Xun's Flavors" Snack Stall.
Chen Xun laughed heartily as he poured oil into a sizzling wok, surrounded by a steady stream of customers.
“Old Ox, quickly find the copper coins for the customer! Don’t waste their time!”
“Moo! Moo!”
The big black ox, drenched in sweat, counted the coins with wide eyes. Some onlookers laughed at its struggle, but they quickly quieted when Chen Xun bellowed, silencing any further mocking.
Two more years passed.
They saved a tidy sum and even treated themselves to a grand feast at a restaurant. Closing their night stall for good, Chen Xun opened a clothing shop.
The big black ox continued to handle the money, mooing alongside Chen Xun as they calculated their accounts, both sweating over the numbers.
Business was good, far more lucrative than the street stall. Chen Xun grew ambitious, declaring they would one day buy land and build a grand courtyard for retirement!
The big black ox believed him wholeheartedly. Chen Xun’s cleverness and resourcefulness were undeniable—he was a genius in its eyes.
Five years passed in the blink of an eye. However,...
Fate was unkind. A great war erupted in the cultivation world. Immortals clashed, and their city was nearly reduced to rubble, with countless casualties!
Chen Xun and the big black ox joined the fleeing townsfolk, abandoning all their possessions. The immortals traversed the skies, their strikes imbued with unimaginable power. How could mere mortals stand against them?!
On the run.
“Old Ox, run! It’s a battle of immortals!”
“Moo~ Moo~”
Chen Xun clung to the big black ox as they fled in panic, all dreams shattered. No immortal would protect mere mortals like them.
Those high above would never know that a casual blow from them could destroy someone’s entire hope and future.
One year later.
After a harrowing year of escape, Chen Xun’s face was weathered and scarred by hardship. His hair was unkempt, and he had nothing left save a few pieces of dried meat.
With his calloused hands, he pulled out a piece of dried meat from his bundle. “Old Ox, you eat first.”
The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, its eyes still filled with happiness. No matter how rough the journey had been, they hadn’t been separated; they had always stayed together.
It bit off half of the dried meat, leaving the rest for Chen Xun. The latter ate it too, and they shared a glance, laughing heartily on the small hillside.
No matter what he had been through, Chen Xun always seemed optimistic, never caught up in worries or regrets.
“Moo~ Moo~~”
The big black ox let out a cheerful snort, still robust and healthy. Returning to the countryside to farm would be no problem for it.
“Old Ox, let’s go home, back to our little village!”
“Moo!”
Chen Xun stood up, wrapping his arms around the big black ox’s head. Together, the two figures walked into the setting sun, their shadows stretching longer and longer as the day faded.
The evening breeze swept over the hillside, ruffling Chen Xun’s slightly straightened robes, adding a carefree touch to his silhouette.
In the days that followed, they returned to their small mountain village. Many of the older villagers looked on with surprise—how could Chen Xun, after all those years of struggling to make a living outside, come back with so little to show for it?
Chen Xun and the big black ox felt rather awkward, so they handed out some wild yams they had gathered during their journey. Truthfully, they hadn’t made much of themselves.
They built a thatched hut under an old crane spirit tree. Chen Xun occasionally taught the village children martial arts, with Little Hei being the most promising pupil.
As his first disciple, Chen Xun and the big black ox placed great expectations on Little Hei!
Time passed day by day, and gradually, the village’s young men began to address Chen Xun with respect, calling him “Instructor Chen.” His twin axes swung with an unstoppable ferocity.
The big black ox was full of strength, tirelessly plowing the fields. The villagers never questioned its longevity, simply assuming it was natural for the ox to live so long.
The big black ox didn’t dwell on it either—it thought it was just born that way. As long as it could stay with Chen Xun, it was content.
Time left no visible scars on the big black ox but etched lines deep into Chen Xun’s face. He was growing old...
The big black ox took over all the heavy labor at home, determined to prevent Chen Xun from straining himself. If Chen Xun didn’t get hurt, he wouldn’t die. Surely, he could stay as vigorous as the big black ox forever!
It firmly believed this, thinking that those who had died were either killed or succumbed to illness. Chen Xun had never fallen sick.
But Chen Xun grew weaker by the day. His back bent lower, his steps slowed, and his movements became clumsy. His eyes often reflected memories, and he grew quieter.
The big black ox began venturing into the mountains alone to find medicinal herbs for him. Sometimes, it fought wild beasts, breaking one of its horns in the process.
Five more years passed.
Today, the air had turned cold, devoid of any warmth.
Rustling sounds came from outside the thatched hut as yellow leaves fell from the old crane spirit tree. A sense of decay and desolation hung in the air, bringing a sharp chill of loneliness.
Chen Xun was entering his final days. The marks of time had wiped away any trace of his youthful vigor. Lying on the bed, he was nearing the end.
When the big black ox returned from the mountains and saw Chen Xun in this state, the herbs it carried fell heavily to the ground. The light sound seemed to shake the earth itself.
Chen Xun’s gaze was gentle as he coughed violently. “Old Ox, life and death are part of the human condition. I won’t be able to walk the road ahead with you.”
“Moo~~ Moo~~”
The big black ox’s eyes trembled, and its breath quickened. It stepped cautiously toward the bed, panic written across its face, not knowing what to do.
Chen Xun stroked the big black ox’s head and pulled a small plate from beside the bed. On it were pieces of dried meat—his final meal prepared for the big black ox.
With a warm smile, he weakly said:
“Old Ox... you eat first.”
“Moo~”
The big black ox froze, its entire body trembling. For the first time, it refused Chen Xun. It didn’t listen to his words.
Its eyes turned red, and it suddenly bolted out, ignoring Chen Xun’s shouts.
