It's over!
A deathtrap!
The disciples of the Five Elements Sect felt their hearts sink. The hot-blooded enthusiasm that had just been ignited was instantly doused, leaving them cold and desolate.
They glanced with growing fear at their two Peak Masters, their backs already soaked with cold sweat. The opposing side not only had more Golden Core cultivators but also outnumbered them in disciples.
Could it be that after cultivating for centuries, everything would turn to naught in a single day...
They gripped their magical artifacts tightly. It was clear that the two Peak Masters were already overwhelmed. They had to break through and report back to the sect.
At this moment, a nondescript disciple from the Spirit Medicine Garden quietly retreated to the back of the group. Though his face showed panic, he had an escape plan.
“Hundreds of years ago, our sect elder was slain by your sect’s Wei Xun. This hatred is irreconcilable,” Xia Yuanqi coldly snorted, hatred flashing in his eyes. “However, that Wei Xun is now suppressed by the Purple Cloud Sect. Isn’t it time for your Five Elements Sect to repay some of that debt?”
“Stop using those high-sounding excuses. If Brother Wei hadn't met with misfortune, would you thieves dare to stand before our Five Elements Sect?!”
“Impudent!”
“Brother Xia, there’s no need to waste words with them. Today, none of the Five Elements Sect will escape! “A stern reprimand came from the rear of the distant giant boat. Xia Han's face was full of frost, “With no one around and the time right, kill!”
Xia Yuanqi’s expression turned slightly unpleasant, cut off before he could finish speaking. However, since it was Xia Han, he let it go. He then waved his hand grandly, spreading his vast spiritual energy across the sky:
“Attack!”
“Kill!”
“Kill!”
From the four giant boats, Tianwu Sect disciples continuously soared into the sky, riding on celestial swords and wielding magical artifacts. The intense killing intent surged through the heavens, making the sky even darker.
“All disciples, defend against the enemy!”
Ji Haoxuan shouted. The black cauldron beside him glowed with mysterious patterns under the stimulation of his spiritual energy, growing larger.
“Yes, Peak Master!”
“Yes, Peak Master!”
The disciples’ eyes filled with bloodshot veins. They were indeed facing a life-and-death catastrophe.
“Brother Ji, remember what I said. Please, don’t act rashly.”
Ji Haoxuan was furious, but a gentle voice entered his mind. He looked up suddenly, seeing the woman rising into the air.
“Sister Liu…”
Ji Haoxuan’s eyes calmed a bit. He glanced at the three attacking sides, quickly calculating gains and losses in his mind.
**Buzz**
**Buzz**
The giant boats continued to streak across the sky, rapidly consuming middle-grade spirit stones. Everyone’s hearts were in their throats, the wind sounding like war drums.
But at that moment... The surrounding air seemed to be abruptly drawn away, and all the cultivators’ thoughts froze for a brief instant.
The howling wind grew quieter, and the flow of spiritual energy slowed. A terrifyingly intense pressure descended suddenly!
The sound of the six giant boats tearing through the sky slowed yet became cautious.
The airborne cultivators of the Tianwu Sect involuntarily paused; their expressions pained.
Their eyes widened in shock as they looked towards the source of the pressure in the distance, their faces reflecting unprecedented horror and awe!
The dense killing intent seemed to dissipate, countless gazes turning towards the shocking scene.
Silence.
It was a silence filled with death. The once clamorous and blood-stained sky, now forcibly stilled before the battle even began.
**Whoosh...**
**Whoosh...**
The wind continued to howl, but not in this part of the sky. There were two black shadows, an endless black, filled with death and despair.
They stood one on each side of the sky, motionless. Though they appeared to be gazing levelly at the battlefield, it felt as if they were looking down upon everyone.
One of the figures, as dark as ink, had three black axe-like objects strapped to their back in an 'X' formation, with one in the center.
Another figure, tall and imposing, carried a massive black coffin on its back, exuding an aura of mystery and unpredictability.
They stood silently, as if they had been waiting there for a long time.
Who?! Who has arrived…
On the Tianwu Sect's giant boat, the sect flag hung limply.
Fan Ping’s eyes widened, trembling with an inexplicable sense of powerlessness. How could this be…
A drop of cold sweat trickled down Xia Han's forehead. Her hands, previously behind her back, had already fallen to her sides. What kind of monstrous beings were these…
Xia Yuanqi felt his hair stand on end, his fingers trembling uncontrollably. That feeling in an instant—it couldn’t be wrong—was the legendary spiritual pressure…
Legend has it that spiritual pressure is achieved by refining one’s spiritual energy to its utmost limit, turning it into something tangible. Even spiritual energy would retreat before it, resulting in unforeseeable consequences.
“Is this something that humans can cultivate?” Xia Yuanqi muttered, his eyes losing focus. The more he knew, the more fear he felt.
On the Five Elements Sect's warship, everyone was gripped by deep despair and suffocation. The two figures in the distance were undoubtedly not allies; they were certainly not here to aid them.
They seemed more like the legendary great fiends of the cultivation world, shrouded in a deathly aura, as if bathed in black flames.
**Boom.**
A black cauldron hovering in the air fell powerlessly, emitting a dull thud.
“Sister Liu… haha.” Ji Haoxuan forced a bitter smile, beginning to think about his last words. “It seems we are destined to rest here forever.”
He looked at Liu Yuan, who was still in a daze, knowing she had been terrified by this dreadful situation.
“However, as cultivators of the Five Elements Sect, how can we not fight…”
Ji Haoxuan, filled with righteous indignation, began to speak passionately. Veins bulged on his forehead.
Although his own spiritual energy circulation had nearly stalled, he continued to frantically gather it, his face turning red.
Liu Yuan, lost in her thoughts, kept her eyes fixed on the two figures.
“Old Ox, grab your weapon, get ready, let's go to the battlefield.”
“Moo.”
In her mind, she recalled the past—the three mountain-opening axes tied to his waist, and the black headgear he held in one hand. It was now both familiar and unfamiliar.
“It’s you…”
A warm smile suddenly appeared on Liu Yuan’s face. She knew that Senior Brother Chen Xun and the black ox had come for her. They had never forgotten.
“Who?” Ji Haoxuan frowned, “Junior Sister, given the circumstances, we should…”
“Disciples, heed my command!!” Before Ji Haoxuan could finish speaking, Liu Yuan retracted her gaze and shouted, “Advance straight ahead!”
The magically amplified voice reached everyone’s ears. The disciples’ eyes widened in disbelief. Wasn’t charging forward akin to seeking death?!
“What?! Liu Junior Sister, you’ve gone mad!”
“Peak Master, you mustn't!”
“Peak Master, please reconsider!”
“Master, those two entities…”
The disciples aboard the two giant boats wailed in despair. They would rather turn back and fight than face these two terrifying creatures.
“This is the Peak Master’s order. Accelerate!” Liu Yuan’s tone was unyielding, even tinged with anger.
Ji Haoxuan suddenly fell silent. He glanced at Liu Yuan and pondered. Death awaited them either way; he might as well trust Liu Junior Sister.
“Forward.”
“Yes.”
“Yes.”
The disciples obeyed, operating the flying boats. New mid-grade spirit stones were inserted into various slots, and the giant boats began to accelerate.
**Buzz**
**Buzz**
The two black figures grew closer, the pressure and suffocating sensation intensifying. The disciples of the Five Elements Sect were drenched in sweat from fear.
**Buzz!**
As they approached, some disciples started trembling uncontrollably, closing their eyes in terror.
