Li Yuanyun was now twenty-five years old. Despite being a mortal, he was clad in brocade, enjoying a comfortable life thanks to his father and siblings. He was now a father of three sons and two daughters.
Although Li Yuanyun belonged to the younger Yuan generation, he looked older than his actual age. Unlike his siblings, who still looked fifteen or sixteen due to years of cultivation, he was aging faster than them and bore the appearance of a man in his thirties. This rapid aging had caused his subordinates to stop addressing him as "young master", instead referring to him as "Old Master".
Li Tongya watched silently with a pale face in his main seat as his eldest grandson kneeled dumbly before him, clutching a wooden box.
Though the old man's vitality was waning, his sharp eyes gleamed with intensity. His gaze lingered on Li Yuanyun's smooth and delicate hands for a while as he stayed silent.
Those hands were fair, short, and chubby. They had never wielded swords or spears; and even the calluses from gripping a brush in his youth had vanished, revealing a delicate smoothness akin to that of a carnivore.
A hint of disappointment flashed in Li Tongya's eyes as he spoke hoarsely.
"Yun'er, come here."
Li Yuanyun approached cautiously, his fear of his imposing grandfather palpable. He wiped tears from his face as he moved forward, still kneeling before Li Tongya.
Li Tongya studied him closely, noting only a trace of melancholy on his face, which was otherwise devoid of frustration or resentment.
Finally, he said, "After mourning your father, go to the marketplace and take charge."
"Understood..." Li Yuanyun murmured in response, too apprehensive to say more. He clutched the wooden box tightly and retreated.
Li Tongya surveyed the faces of the younger generation warmly and assured them, "Though my injuries are severe, I can still hold on for a few more years… If I can obtain a spiritual item like Stalactite Jade Liquid, it might extend my life further. There's no need to worry. Carry on with your tasks."
"Ancestor… Take this."
Li Yuanjiao presented a jade box to him with both hands, but Li Tongya gently pushed it away.
Though exhausted, the old man managed a faint smile and replied, "Keep it for yourself."
He carefully rose to his feet, unclasped the Qingche Sword from his waist, and hung the sword on the main seat. This sword, having been nurtured by him for many years, had developed a spirit of its own; and as soon as it left Li Tongya's grasp, it buzzed reluctantly and swayed.
Li Tongya turned back to his descendants, his instructions tinged with uncertainty.
"Do not go out of your way to seek any medicine for me, and above all, do not think about any blood sacrifice. Focus on yourselves."
"Understood!"
The juniors responded in unison.
Li Tongya stood with his hands clasped behind him, then slowly walked out of the courtyard. He made his way along the stone path laid down by Li Xiangping years ago, heading toward the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche.
In the courtyard, several juniors approached to comfort Li Qinghong and discussed the arrangements for Li Xuanling's funeral. Eventually, each went their separate ways down the mountain to attend to their own tasks.
Summer gave way to autumn, and rainfall became scarce.
Li Xuanling's funeral on the mountain was conducted in a simple manner. White silk decorated the courtyard for just a few months before being taken down swiftly. Li Yuanyun went to the marketplace, and Li Qinghong stood guard at Mount Yuting.
The first batch of Li Family elders also passed away in succession, and funerals became commonplace. Within a matter of two weeks or a few months, they were concluded haphazardly. When the rice harvesting season arrived, everyone became far too occupied to have time to grieve.
Meanwhile, in Eastern Mount Yue…
Birds chirped on Mount Wutu as newly polished stone benches and chairs were placed in the courtyard.
Li Yuanjiao, dressed in white, sat quietly by the stone table. Setting his jade cup down, he remarked softly, "It's been quite some time since I last saw you, cousin."
The middle-aged man seated opposite him chuckled. He had tan skin, wearing a jade crown and a long robe. His eyes were tinged faintly with violet.
"I heard a rumor recently about our ancestor slaying a Maha with his sword on Mount Bianyan and attaining mastery of the Sword Essence. The tale has spread far and wide, and many pleaded I ask you about it…" he began.
Li Yuanjiao chuckled lightly, meeting his gaze with a smile. "Ah, that indeed happened…" he answered.
Shamoli had originally worn a relaxed smile, but upon hearing Li Yuanjiao's confirmation, he was stunned as if struck by lightning. He instantly sat upright and exclaimed incredulously, "But that's…! That's a Maha we're talking about!"
"A Maha Incarnate," Li Yuanjiao corrected him.
"Even so, how could someone at the Foundation Establishment Realm challenge a Maha Reincarnation—let alone slay him with a sword and send ripples through Mount Yue?! The Old Ancestor... he's truly a divine figure!" Shamoli blurted out.
Shamoli, currently only at the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, had consumed various unrefined qi, hence resulting in his slow cultivation progress. He had long been outpaced by Li Yuanjiao.
Any aspirations he might have harbored in the past had long been extinguished. Nevertheless, this news filled him with pride, and his eyes gleamed with joy as he exclaimed, "Amazing!"
Li Yuanjiao maintained his composure, smiling as he raised his cup to drink. Shamoli was visibly excited and spoke with great enthusiasm.
"Since the destruction of Mount Wu and the divide of Mount Yue into Western Mount Yue, Mount Yue State, and others, our Eastern Mount Yue has been overlooked by the major families… These Foundation Establishment cultivators on Mount Yue clearly do not respect the main family! It really irked me."
Shamoli brought out several boxes, each containing wooden and jade items. He lined them up neatly on the table and said, "I brought all the congratulatory gifts here. I dare not keep any single one of them for myself!"
"I never suspected you," Li Yuanjiao responded casually, sweeping his spiritual sense over the boxes swiftly. The spirit items in the box appeared in his mind's eye immediately.
These Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of Mount Yue were all calculative men who would not let out the falcon if there was no rabbit in sight, and the spirit items they presented were only of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Nevertheless, Li Yuanjiao collected the insincere gifts.
Shamoli's behavior was exactly as Li Yuanjiao had anticipated. Mount Yue was not alone in traveling to Lijing Town to congratulate the Li Family; several cultivators, whether passing through or arriving specifically for the occasion, did the same. Several prominent families under the Li Family's rule were also joyous and honored, basking in unexpected happiness.
As Shamoli grew older, he grew even more naggy. He shared various tidbits about the Tian Family and the Mount Yue nobles. Li Yuanjiao listened attentively to everything, nodding as he escorted Shamoli down the mountain and bid him farewell.
Xiao Guilan watched Shamoli descend the mountain and slowly depart with his entourage before she gracefully emerged from the house. Her sharp, narrow eyes blinked gently as she laughed.
"That Shamoli is not as bad as rumors might suggest!"
Xiao Guiluan had reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She cultivated the Meridian Nourishment Technique of the Xiao Family, a Grade Four technique that was a grade superior to the Li Family's. Naturally, her progress in cultivation was faster.
"He has been reigning for more than ten years," Li Yuanjiao remarked as he tidied up the jade cups on the table.
"Well, it's a good thing that he's keeping an eye on the Tian Family and the Mount Yue nobles all these years…" Li Yuanjiao said softly, treating his wife with great tenderness.
Xiao Guiluan chuckled lightly, then sat down beside him and said, "The Xiao Family has also sent representatives… My sisters who are familiar with the family are amazed. There are wild rumors circulating, claiming our family has an immortal sword and inherits the way of the sword. Supposedly, whoever draws this sword will become the head of the family! Although your cultivation realm is high, the sword did not acknowledge you, that's why you have no choice but to remain a young master. Meanwhile, Yuanping, who is frail and sickly, happens to be an expert in sword techniques…"
Xiao Guiluan repeated what she heard to Li Yuanjiao, causing him to burst out laughing.
"Do you believe the rumors spread by a bunch of rogue Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators who cultivate with various unrefined qi?" he asked, amused.
"Of course not!" Xiao Guiluan huffed. She lowered her head and voice as she continued, "Rumors concerning the Old Ancestor or our legacy have always been taboo, and the Clan Affairs Courtyard has enforced strict silence on such matters. But now that this rumor has gained considerable spread, it's causing me to have doubts."
Li Yuanjiao's smile faded as he looked at her, noticing her eyelids fluttering.
"Carry on," he encouraged.
Xiao Guiluan's sharp, narrow eyes fixed on him. The two exchanged a few breaths of silence before Xiao Guiluan asked calmly, "Is the Old Ancestor… still in good health?"
