"Monk, we have a small request as well." Chen Xun took out a storage bag full of local specialities. "It really is nothing major."
The monk nodded slightly, simply watching Chen Xun.
Chen Xun smiled broadly and said, "We would like to learn a Buddhist practice for transcending spirits and ascending to immortality."
"Moo~~~" The big black ox took a small step forward. This matter was crucial.
On their journey, they visited several temples but didn't find any answers. Now, the timing seemed just right.
Little Red's eyes darted around nervously. While the words of his two companions seemed polite, he sensed something off and couldn't help but shiver.
The monk understood and didn’t give it much thought. "Indeed, there are many such Buddhist practices."
"Monk, please accept this storage bag as an exchange."
"No need." The monk smiled gently, sitting cross-legged on the cushion. "Please wait a moment, benefactors."
With a wave of his robe, powerful spiritual energy rippled through the air. A blank book appeared, and rows of mysterious scripture shadows formed in the hall.
They seemed to be arranging themselves, and the blank book began to show the outline of spell inscriptions.
This scene left them dumbfounded—what kind of technique was this?!
Half an hour later, the monk withdrew his energy and looked at Chen Xun. "Benefactor, this method of transcendence only contains the first half. The latter half can be supplemented through your own understanding."
"Thank you, Monk!"
"Moo!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox were overjoyed, their eyes sparkling with excitement. Their previous method of transcendence was too ordinary, and the special effects were all improvised by themselves.
"Old Ox, Little Red, time to run!"
Whoosh!
Whoosh!
Whoosh!
With Chen Xun's loud command, they instantly disappeared from the Temple. The monk's face turned red, immobilized by a suppressing force, with a storage bag forcibly stuffed into his hand...
It wasn't until the three had completely vanished that the oppressive force faded. The monk shook his head with a wry smile, noticing a letter inside the storage bag, seemingly left for him.
"The benefactor is a person of great wisdom. Why cling to the Buddhist path? Who in the cycle of reincarnation can truly comprehend it?"
A low murmur echoed in the temple hall, but there was no response, only a gentle breeze passing through.
...
A month later, at night, in a desolate wilderness.
Chen Xun, the big black ox, and Little Red sat around a Spirit Crane Tree, surrounded by incense burners, chanting softly.
"First Immortal Ascension Technique, a great dream returns to the beginning, heaven and earth fall silent!"
Chen Xun shouted, and thirty-six incense burners spiraled into the sky. The smoke surged wildly, forming a miniature version of the Spirit Crane Tree. "Stabilize its original form, return to the source."
The bark of the hundred-year-old Spirit Crane Tree began to crack and fall away. Though there was no wind that night, its branches and leaves trembled, and leaves fell continuously.
"Moo!!"
The big black ox bellowed, transforming its hooves into hands. Another thirty-six incense burners spiraled upwards, with the smoke turning into spikes, piercing into the Spirit Crane Tree.
"Second Immortal Ascension Technique, soul tethered to dreams, return the soul!"
Stabilize the three souls; seize the seven spirits.
"Third Immortal Ascension Technique, annihilate the soul, scatter the bones!"
Little Red shouted with all his might. The final thirty-six incense burners spiraled upwards, initiating the grand array of 108 incense burners.
Whooo!
Whooo!
In an instant, a chilling wind swept across the wilderness. Leaves swirled, and the bright moonlight cast an eerie glow on the scene.
The three exchanged glances and struck their hands together as the smoke surged like a tide. Together, they roared, "Send the friend to immortality!!"
Boom! Boom!
The hundred-year-old Spirit Crane Tree exploded, but no splinters or debris flew. It simply vanished into thin air, leaving no trace, not even its roots.
"Hahaha..."
"Moo~~!"
"Brother Xun, the third Immortal Ascension Technique is so terrifying!" Little Red was both nervous and excited. "The Buddhist method given by the monk is no joke."
"Moo!" The big black ox slapped Little Red on the head. "This was modified by our big brother!"
Little Red held his head in a daze, staring at the big black ox. He had thought it was the monk’s secret move.
"Little Red, stick with us, and you’ll learn a lot." Chen Xun crossed his arms, feeling proud of his creation. "Just mastering your brother Ox's skills could take you a lifetime, not to mention what you can learn from me."
This was his first time using a spell involving the soul. The transcending method, when combined with spellcraft and spiritual sense, felt entirely different.
Indeed, every sect had its own unique strengths. In the world of cultivation, the more skills, the better.
"Moo moo!" The big black ox grinned, patting Little Red.
Little Red, wide-eyed and bewildered, quickly jumped onto the ox's back to chat.
"Let's go. The Buddhist matter is settled. One wish fulfilled." Chen Xun gazed into the distance. "Let's head west, trade for some spirit stones, and prepare to set sail."
"Moo!"
"Got it, Brother Xun!" Little Red shouted enthusiastically. As long as they didn't stay in The Great Li Realm, he was content. He held deep loathing for that land.
Chen Xun waved his hand, summoning a small flying boat. They boarded and flew toward the city.
Two months later, they had completely left the Buddhist territories of The Great Li Realm.
...
In the Western Sea Prefecture, the westernmost region of The Great Li Realm, cultivators were everywhere, and the trade in cultivation was thriving. Many sea beasts were captured and sold here.
The forces in this region were complex, with countless sects and guilds, though they still seemed insignificant compared to the vast Western Sea.
Foundation-building Sea beasts absorbed the spiritual energy of the Western Sea to cultivate, and over time, they developed demon cores.
Their flesh and blood were highly beneficial to cultivators, and their skin, tendons, and bones could be used to craft magical tools. These sea beasts were truly treasures, providing endless resources.
Despite the many dangers in the vast Western Sea, cultivators still flocked there, seeking opportunities, much like those who ventured into the great Heavenly Rift.
Pingyun City, the central hub of Western Sea Prefecture, was a vital stop for travelers from other regions.
In the city center, a large teleportation array frequently flickered with light as fierce-looking cultivators emerged, scanning the surroundings.
At that moment, three figures stepped out of the teleportation array, their faces weathered from travel. They took a deep breath.
Above the city, countless cultivators flew through the air, either riding on magical tools or flying boats, with the occasional Golden Core cultivator walking through the sky.
"Damn, the cost of that teleportation array is outrageous." Chen Xun spat, glancing at Little Red. "I’m out of mid-grade spirit stones. Little Red, how about we sell you? You should be worth a few thousand mid-grade spirit stones, right?"
"Huh? Brother Xun? I’m not worth anything!" Little Red, still lying on the big black ox, sprang up in shock. "Can’t we think this through a little more?!"
"Moo moo moo~" The big black ox laughed heartily, nudging Chen Xun.
"Haha, just kidding." Chen Xun laughed, grabbing Little Red with one hand and patting the big black ox with the other. "Come on, let’s go earn some spirit stones."
"Moo~" The big black ox's eyes roamed around, seeing cultivators everywhere, especially foundation builders, in overwhelming numbers.
Outside the teleportation array, various guilds had their outposts, and people stood by, waiting to approach any newly arrived cultivators.
With Chen Xun's mid-Golden Core cultivation level, most foundation-building cultivators didn’t dare approach, lacking the qualification.
At that moment, a female Golden Core cultivator in green robes had been eyeing Chen Xun for a while. He looked quite ridiculous, carrying a red dog in one hand and holding the big black ox’s head in the other.
