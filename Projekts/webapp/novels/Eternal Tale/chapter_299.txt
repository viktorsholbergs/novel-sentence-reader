Ahead, there was no road.
A vast grayish-blue canopy stretched across the black-soiled earth and the boundless sky, whose edges faded into infinity.
This canopy was translucent, spanning tens of millions of miles, its depths unfathomable.
Yet, when one looked up, radiant grayish-blue light bloomed, shooting skyward in a magnificent, breathtaking display. Within the canopy, gray light dots floated as though suspended in gel.
But no matter the creature, facing this canopy evoked a profound sense of helplessness—a sensation akin to standing before the might of heaven and earth: inviolable, immovable.
If assumptions were correct, this was the very edge of the boundary realm—an endless dead zone. Here... there truly was no road.
The canopy illuminated everything, bringing light to the darkness, but its aura exuded despair and deathly silence. It was like finding water in a vast desert, only to realize it was undrinkable seawater.
Chen Xun and the big black ox appeared calm, but their hearts churned with immense turmoil.
The scene before them was more terrifying than the ancient formations they'd encountered. If a path truly existed here, it would have to be carved out infinitely forward, entirely different from the formations they'd faced.
Chen Xun's long hair fell loosely over his shoulders, and his eyes radiated a commanding aura. He suddenly stepped forward. "Old Ox, I'll hold them off. The rest is up to you."
His words carried a bone-chilling coldness. His robe began to flutter despite the absence of wind, and his bandit-style armor now completely enveloped him, exposing only his icy eyes.
"Moo!"
The big black ox turned its head to glance behind them. Black dust surged like waves, the earth trembled violently, and an overwhelming aura of killing intent and hatred erupted. A ceaseless rumble resonated through the ground.
Far off in the horizon, massive black mountains trembled, radiating oppressive waves as they pressed toward them. The corrupted, decaying aura they carried had already surpassed the early stages of Divine Transformation!
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Black mist surged into the heavens, and the tainted stench of blood spread to every corner, staining the grayish-blue sky with a sinister crimson hue, laden with a suffocating air of rot and decay.
Countless grotesque creatures filled the heavens and the earth, emitting roars, screeches, and howls; their forms varied and terrifying.
Hundreds of thousands... millions... tens of millions of these corrupted beings gathered, darkening the skies in every direction. The oppressive, frigid aura of the battlefield weighed down like an invisible hand choking the very air.
An unending tide of abominations surged toward the massive ark like ravenous demons crawling out of the abyss, vast and boundless.
In an instant... the heavens and earth changed color. Winds howled, clouds surged, and the icy gusts roared like ocean waves. The tremors that followed spread like earthquakes, their thunderous roars reverberating ceaselessly.
The entire boundary realm battlefield erupted into chaos. A blood-soaked slaughterfest was about to begin!
Chen Xun slowly ascended into the air, gripping two massive axes brimming with deathly energy. Towering above, he surveyed the heavens and earth, his fierce, domineering aura erupting like a tidal wave. Subtle sounds of wind and thunder echoed faintly around him.
Five resolute figures followed closely behind, their gazes sweeping the battlefield as streaks of lightning surged in their eyes.
Chen Xun lightly tapped his twin axes against his waist. His silver hair danced wildly as his figure shot skyward.
At the same time, radiant light from the five elements streaked across the firmament. A deathly mist spread through the air, engulfing over a thousand meters of black fog and surging toward the endless tide of abominations.
"Kill!"
Boom boom boom!
Six radiant beams of divine energy converged, their overwhelming aura blanketing the heavens. They coalesced into a dazzling river of light, suspended across the skies.
In an instant, it felt as though divine judgment had descended, shaking the heavens for thousands of miles. The black-soiled earth rippled like ocean waves, towering tsunamis roaring as if an apocalyptic seaquake loomed.
Meanwhile, two primordial souls ascended toward the heavens, and the entire world quaked suddenly. A resounding hum echoed in the air as immense spiritual pressure and destructive storms swept forth, forming a massive net that enveloped all.
Another primordial soul activated countless talismans of transcendence in mid-air. The talismans hovered in the sky, their oppressive might covering thousands of miles.
Chen Xun swung one of his massive axes heavenward, exhaling a thunderous breath. The boundless energy of the five elements surged from within him, radiating divine brilliance.
Around him, the very space coalesced into terrifying wheels of starfall, rumbling like muffled thunder. Massive meteor-like projectiles descended from the skies, crashing down with earth-shattering force!
The overwhelming pressure caused the black-soiled earth to tremble and crack, fissures spreading in every direction. The malevolent aura suffusing the land was momentarily subdued.
Boom!
Boom!
Starfall meteors erupted upon impact, transforming the ground into a raging sea of fire. Waves of destructive energy surged in all directions, terrifying in their intensity, as though a crimson tide of devastation swept across the heavens.
On the ground, the endless horde of corrupted creatures froze, their expressions twisting with shock and terror. All around, wails of anguish and desperate struggles echoed ceaselessly.
Yet, the true battle was only just beginning!
At that moment, six colossal beams of light followed closely behind, stepping forth in unison. From their mouths erupted ancient, thunderous roars that seemed to echo from the depths of time, vast and boundless.
Like a tsunami, their momentum surged toward the other side, waves of power crashing and colliding. Sand and stones were sent flying as torrents of energy roiled chaotically in all directions.
In the blink of an eye, their bodies' apertures fully opened. The surrounding space shook with wind and thunder, arcs of lightning streaking across the sky. The void trembled, and the earth shivered faintly.
They absorbed the surging five-elemental energy of heaven and earth, their strikes capable of splitting the heavens and shattering the earth!
Boom! Boom! Boom!
The black-soiled earth became a ravaged wasteland, devastated by the sheer power unleashed by Chen Xun. The battlefield roared and seethed in chaos.
At the same time...
Under the level of Divine Transformation, the wails of corrupted creatures rose like a dirge, their bodies torn to shreds. Countless severed limbs, corpses, and corrupted blood littered the battlefield.
With a single blow, tens of thousands of corrupted creatures were slain in a bloodbath. Yet they remained undeterred. More and more creatures surged forward, as though guarding something of immense importance.
The black soil lay in ruins, riddled with craters, corrupted blood flowing everywhere like rivers.
On the massive ark, Little Red stood, cold sweat pouring down his face. His gaze had turned razor-sharp, and even his blood felt as if it were freezing.
Destruction on a cosmic scale!
This was true destruction—annihilation on an apocalyptic level!
Little Red looked toward Brother Xun, who stood bathed in radiant lightning, like a true celestial being. His heart trembled with awe for a long time. One man was holding the enemy at bay from a thousand miles away—standing against countless corrupted creatures alone!
"Living being, how dare you!"
"To trespass upon the ancestral lands of the realm spirits—heaven will not allow it!"
"You deserve death!"
Rolling, wrathful roars reverberated from the heavens. The winds cried like ghosts, and corrupted blood drenched the sky. Even massive black mountains followed in the horde’s wake while piercing, thunderous sonic booms filled the air.
Chen Xun's eyes gleamed with icy resolve. His twin axes crossed in front of his chest, deathly energy surging forth in an apocalyptic wave, engulfing him completely.
Two world-shaking beams of axe light slashed downward from the heavens, resembling colossal dragons of death, imbued with an aura of annihilation. They were unstoppable, exuding the essence of obliteration!
An overwhelming sense of dread pierced the air. The corrupted creatures of Divine Transformation stared in disbelief, freezing mid-air as the realization struck them.
"Block it!"
The voices of hatred echoed fiercely from the horizon. Their auras surged wildly, shaking the skies, and a terrifying explosion of corrupted blood enveloped them, causing the earth below to fracture and collapse.
From the epicenter, corrupted blood erupted violently, forming a barrier that barely withstood the deathly axe light!
Rumble!
The moment the two forces collided, black mountains in the background shattered one after another. The horizon became a hazy blur, completely consumed by deathly energy.
The surroundings had already been obliterated beyond recognition. The void distorted and warped under the pressure, threatening to collapse entirely.
Chen Xun let out a cold snort and divine light from the five elements burst from his palms, coiling around his axes. As the extinction storm swept forth, countless corrupted creatures on the ground were lifted into the air and exploded mid-flight!
Whoosh!
Whoosh!
Several piercing noises tore through the void as the remnants of the deathly strike dissipated. From the blackened light, figures emerged, charging forward undaunted. The collision was soul-shaking, a scene of unrelenting terror.
The surrounding spiritual energy raged uncontrollably. Corrupted blood spattered, the void hummed, and the collision between the mightiest forces of the boundary realm surged like a tide.
At that moment, it felt as though the heavens and earth were being turned upside down.
Chen Xun lifted his head, unafraid, already accustomed to walking the fine line between life and death. He was prepared to fight till the last drop of his blood!
He leaned forward slightly, and with a thunderous boom, shot forth from the sky. His twin axes, charged with deathly energy, slashed through the heavens, leaving blazing trails of flame. In an instant, they traveled a thousand miles, annihilating any corrupted creature in their path.
The void is blurred and distorted. The earth crumbled apart as black fissures crisscrossed the shattered black mountains, forming a scene of incomprehensible devastation.
Every corrupted creature of Divine Transformation that faced him was stunned with disbelief.
Where had this monstrous figure come from?!
How much life force could he possibly burn through? Was he immortal?!
All the corrupted creatures looked up at the silver-haired man in the heavens, their hearts sinking with an inexplicable dread. His life force and strength defied all logic.
