The howling north wind was completely isolated outside the enclosed cabin of the Dawn Cloudliner. The wooden chairs on the Cloudliner were cushioned with brocade fabric and enchanted with spells, making them exceptionally comfortable.
"Yi Mountain City..."
Liu Changdie sank into the wooden chair as his gaze lingered on the majestic city below, feeling emotions stirring within him. He thought to himself, In my previous life, I came to this place as an insignificant Qi Cultivator of the second heavenly layer… In this life, I have already reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
Looking at the ancient city before his eyes, the image of a golden longbow appeared in Liu Changdie's mind, causing him to frown as he was filled with deep confusion.
There are more and more changes… Li Tongya killed Yu Xiaogui with his sword... This is another event that never happened in my previous life. Could the formation I set up for the Li Family have changed everything?
Liu Changdie was originally an ordinary cultivator, but with these memories, he had been living his life smoothly. Now, everything had become unrecognizable, causing him to feel a fearful chill down his spine.
In my previous life, after Li Tongya killed the Maha, he disappeared. The Master Monks of the Lotus Temple besieged Mount Lijing. I had thought of saving them to make them owe me a favor... But now, Li Tongya is still guarding the Li Family, and the bald monks of the Lotus Temple seem to have become recluses.
The Yu Family not only failed to breach the Fei Family's defense, but they also lost Yu Xiaogui. The situation on the lake is entirely different now. My past life's memories are no longer of much use…
As the altitude continued to drop, he felt a sense of confusion, thinking, Now that Li Qinghong is not dead, the Li Family will be even more different. Without the previous life's knowledge and assistance, Li Yuanjiao may not consider me his brother… Fortunately, I have made friends with those from the Xuan generation, so it's not too bad.
Seeing the advantages of his rebirth gradually fading, Liu Changdie began to lose hope.
I do not know if Mufeng and Zhongqing have reached the Qi Cultivation Realm. It seems I still need to return to the Li Family... After all, I am not destined to roam the world alone.
Lost in thought, he felt a slight weight underfoot as clouds appeared beneath him. The man standing at the bow of the ship poked his head inside and said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoists, we have arrived!"
Liu Changdie quickly stood up as they descended upon the city below. He saw a majestic great wall stretching out and covered in intricate runes, forming a unified whole and turning the entire city itself into a grand formation.
"As expected of the city left by the Moonlight Origin Mansion. No other formations of the present era could be compared to it!"
Liu Changdie had lost count of the times he had climbed up and down these city walls in his previous life, but he was still filled with emotion. Looking up, he saw eagles and sparrows circling relentlessly above the land with bones scattered everywhere. In the distance, a dense forest raised waves of leaves in the north wind.
"This is Yi Mountain City!"
Following his memories, Liu Changdie landed at this first stronghold of the Yue State, and he saw the cultivators around the stronghold gathering. He searched carefully and finally saw a middle-aged man carrying a golden bow, who was smiling at him.
"Brother Xuanfeng!"
Liu Changdie ignored the others surrounding him and eagerly went over, saying joyfully, "Congratulations!"
Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, his gaze lighting up with interest. He asked, "What is there to congratulate about?"
"Hahahaha," Liu Changdie laughed heartily and said, "Senior Tongya has slain the Maha with his sword and forced the retreat of a prestigious clan… His reputation is resounding!"
Most of the cultivators on the stronghold were from around Moongaze Lake. Hearing this, they were all stunned, finding it hard to believe and silently swallowing in fear.
Before Li Xuanfeng could speak, someone asked a question that caught everyone's attention immediately.
"Has Senior already broken through to the Purple Mansion Realm?"
"No..." Liu Changdie replied softly as he gathered everyone to sit down and began to explain in detail. The group listened, occasionally gasping and sighing.
When he mentioned Fei Wangbai's death, Fei Yihe suddenly stood up, his face flushed with disbelief. "How is that possible?! Our Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation isn't just for show! What nonsense are you spouting!" he exclaimed in shock and anger.
Liu Changdie smiled wryly, having anticipated his reaction.
"If you do not believe me, you can go to the other cities and ask around. There is nothing more I can do..."
Seeing Fei Yihe's incredulous expression, Liu Changdie thought to himself, Losing just Fei Wangbai is far better than the entire clan being wiped out!
Li Family.
In the hall, Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping stood with their cupped fists. The middle-aged man at the head wore several medicine pouches at his waist, exuding a gentle demeanor. He stroked his beard with one hand and placed the other on Li Ximing's back, his eyes slightly closed.
"The red haze in the Sea of Qi rises fourfold, Shenyang Mansion harmonizes water and fire, Juque acupoint's spiritual energy flows continuously, and twelve levels of the trachea align in harmony…"
Xiao Yuansi nodded lightly and said warmly, "Congratulations to both of you! This child indeed has a constitution suited for alchemy. His heart fire is balanced and just, making him particularly adept at refining pills that can enhance cultivation and break through barriers. This is quite rare!"
Xiao Yuansi was always gentle and scholarly. Even when facing two juniors, he remained courteous and calm. Li Yuanjiao was overjoyed upon hearing this and replied, "Thank you, Senior!"
Xiao Yuansi chuckled and shook his head, saying kindly, "No need to thank me... but I shall accept it."
He took out a jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to Li Ximing, explaining, "Your family's Snake Dragon Tree bears fruit annually, and it is a hassle to send it to me each time. I used a private recipe to exchange this Snake Essence Pill formula from my clan… Consider it a meeting gift for Ming'er."
Li Yuanjiao had always heard that this senior took great care of their clan and was trustworthy, which was why he dared to invite him. Unexpectedly, Xiao Yuansi presented such a grand gift, leaving Li Yuanjiao somewhat overwhelmed. "This is too much!" he exclaimed.
Xiao Yuansi laughed, shaking his head. He let out a sigh and said, "No need to be so polite. Since you invited me, I cannot be stingy! I promised Jing'er that I would take good care of your family."
The two brothers wanted to express their gratitude further, but Xiao Yuansi simply waved them off and said, "Our family's ancestor has been away for many years. I had just returned from gathering herbs in the mountains this month, only to hear about Tongya slaying the Maha and forcing the retreat of the Yu Family… What happened?"
Li Yuanjiao felt a chill run through him, thinking to himself, The Xiao Family certainly knows the truth about Li Tongya slaying the Maha… Even if they don't know the specifics of what happened in the end, they must know that our ancestor was used as bait!
Xiao Yuansi's gaze was calm and his eyes gentle, giving no hint of any hidden knowledge. This made Li Yuanjiao feel a cold sweat break out on his back, and he thought to himself, It seems the Xiao Family is intentionally keeping things from him… Should I tell him or not?
He hesitated for a moment, his mind racing with thoughts, feeling deeply apprehensive.
Our Li Family shouldn't be aware of this! Although Xiao Yuansi has good intentions, a gentleman should be forthright. Perhaps Xiao Guitu and the others are using this to test us…
He then shook his head and answered, "Our ancestor returned and immediately went into seclusion. We are not aware of the details; we only know that the Maha was merely a reincarnated body."
Xiao Yuansi gazed intently at him for a moment, then nodded thoughtfully before asking, "I received a letter from my junior sister a while ago. Is it true that you have a child studying under her?"
"Indeed!"
Li Yuanjiao was eager for the change in topic and quickly called Li Xizhi over.
Li Xizhi, dressed in a brocade robe, had a dignified appearance. Although he was not as impressive as his younger brother Li Xijun, he still stood in the courtyard with a certain grace.
