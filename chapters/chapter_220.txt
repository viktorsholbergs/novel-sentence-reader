"Indeed…" Li Tongya answered in a low voice, to which the old man immediately showed delight, his face beaming. He lightly tapped his bamboo pole, moving closer to the small island.
Draped in a damp straw raincoat that was soaked with the morning dew, the old man's face was honest and kind, his white beard hanging downward. His eyes, sharp and vigorous beneath his broad hat, sparkled as Li Tongya boarded the small boat.
The old man laughed heartily, skillfully handling the smooth oar to head toward the riverbank.
"I have been rowing boats here for over ten years… Rest assured, once we leave the lake and follow the Big Fish Creek southward, Lichuankou Village will soon be in sight!"
Li Tongya scanned him with his spiritual sense and realized that the man in front of him was merely a mortal. While he was standing at the stern enjoying the lake view, the old man was exerting more effort. He raised his hands high and pushed hard, making the small boat travel both steady and fast.
After glancing at Li Tongya's expression, he said with a beaming smile, "Master, you have a noble face and a majestic demeanor… clearly the evidence of a great and kind person!"
"A kind person?" Li Tongya paused and repeated the old man's words, almost laughing out loud. Suddenly intrigued, he touched the sword at his waist and said softly, "It seems you are mistaken, old boatman… My family and I are naturally bad seeds. We aren't good people."
Despite frequently cultivating in seclusion, he had killed many since he began his journey as an immortal cultivator, and the number of those indirectly harmed by him was countless. By that alone, he was far from a good person.
The old man was taken aback, not expecting such a response from Li Tongya. He laughed hoarsely and, while still rowing, chuckled a response.
"You must be jesting!"
"Hmm."
Li Tongya simply hummed and withdrew his gaze. He could not help feeling as though something was vaguely familiar about the man's face.
"I find your face familiar... have we met before?"
The old man put down his oar and sized up Li Tongya before turning his attention back to his rowing, laughing in amusement once more.
"Perhaps I have seen you once… I too was born into a prominent clan, never short of food or clothes. In my youth, I roamed the Guli Road and met many people."
"A prominent clan..?" Li Tongya asked as he narrowed his eyes slightly. Though his expression remained unchanged, he suddenly felt an indescribable sensation within him. His typically commanding and steady aura receded, causing a shiver in those who saw it.
Fortunately, the old man, wearing his hat and completely focused on his rowing, did not notice but instead let out a laugh once more.
"My surname was originally Lu, from the Lu Family in the west. After the old ancestor of the Lu Family passed away, and our connection with the immortal sect severed... our family was divided between the An and Li families. I had no choice but to change my surname to Liu and fend for myself."
"I see." Li Tongya responded, then said in a low voice, "Judging by your appearance, your days seem quite bearable."
The old man shook his head and sighed. Yet, he continued his steady rowing and chuckled.
"Master, there are three hardships in this world: rowing boats, forging iron, and grinding tofu… They are indeed tiring work!" he remarked with a grin.
After they crossed the turbulent river center, the boat eventually stabilized with the river's flow. The Li Family was known for its strict governance and exacting demands on its clan members, avoiding monopolistic practices; and with the support of Mount Yue, the common folk led relatively comfortable lives.
The old man propped his oar and opened a small stove in the middle of the boat, surprisingly producing a cup of warm rice wine.
He lifted his head to take a sip and exhaled in satisfaction before continuing, "Every profession in this world has its hardships… everyone has their own sorrows, and understanding this makes it easier."
He squinted nostalgically, remarking somewhat wistfully, "When I was young, I had great ambitions. I traveled as a wanderer, returned in middle age to enjoy life with a yellow dog and a beautiful concubine, playing the role of a father… But in my old age, my clan was destroyed overnight, and I found myself kneeling on the ground like a beggar. The wonder of life is exactly like this! Those immortals may seem carefree, but they too have their sufferings. Alas… Have you any idea where the sons of the immortal clans have gone lately?"
Li Tongya was silent for a while, observing the old man's demeanor before speaking softly, "The Li Family is no saint either... Have you ever harbored hatred toward them?"
"Hatred?" The old man repeated as he paused and set down the oar once more. He lifted the stove to reveal the charcoal beneath and showed the rice wine to Li Tongya.
"I'm just a humble boatman. In spring, I can use charcoal to brew wine… Though I can't drink freely, I still manage to enjoy a good drink every three days."
The old man picked up the oar again after he said this, stirring up a trail of water and pointing toward the western mountains.
"Tyrannical rulers, mass murderers… exploiting the entire Mount Yue for their own lavish lifestyles!" he exclaimed with a wave of his hand.
His wrinkled, thin finger then pointed toward the region of Lixia Prefecture, continuing, "Whole clans are wiped out and the entire prefecture is destroyed while the immortal clans remain silent… merely observing!"
Finally, he pointed toward the Yu Family's Milin Prefecture, his tone fierce this time.
"Commoners are displaced, resorting to trading their children for food. While the clans drink and throw pot games, singing joyously, the commoners weep. Butchers hang dog heads, but beneath them, they sell human flesh. The price of human flesh has fallen even more this year, from three coins per jin last year to just two coins now…"
Tears streamed down the old man's cheeks as he spoke softly, "Seeing such suffering among the people, yet I can still drink and burn charcoal… The dissolution of my old clan was merely the removal of a scourge; what is there to hate?"
Li Tongya was deeply moved and sat down beside the old man. The two let the small boat drift on its own as the old man drank again, tears streaming down his cheeks.
He spoke in a deep voice, "Master said that the Li Family is no good either, but if we are to judge good from evil, I, who don't have many years left, might as well speak some words worth beheading for."
He picked up the oar, his beard bristling. Dewdrops rolled down his beard as he clenched his teeth and declared, "Demons, immortals, sects, clans, the powerful, and even the common people—everyone, if judged by their morality, deserves to be killed!"
Such words coming from a mortal sent a slight chill through Li Tongya. The usual sounds of birds, beasts, and insects along the river ceased.
The old man then sighed softly and added, "Having seen so much and so many people, I no longer consider the deceitful and vile as evil, nor do I consider the upright as good. In this lawless world, the vile thrive and the upright perish. To truly judge good from evil, one should look at only one thing."
"And what is that?" Li Tongya asked softly.
After taking another sip of his wine, the old man answered, "If the people under one's rule are joyful and well-fed, that is good; if they are displaced, resorting to cannibalism, that is evil. The Li Family strictly disciplines its members and manages its household rigorously, excelling in planning. The commoners live almost divine lives, all looking forward to their leadership. Did you not see that when that young lord passed away, every household in the town was mourning? If any hypocrite barks about misconduct, the people would spit at him and point at his backbone."
As the gravity of his words fell, Li Tongya pondered deeply. The two sat facing each other in silence.
After a dozen breaths, the old man picked up the oar again and wiped his tears, smiling softly. "It seems I've lost my composure," he said with a wistful voice.
"Not at all, your words were enlightening."
Li Tongya cupped his fist solemnly, feeling an unexpected sense of peace within his heart. He spoke softly, "Before my father passed away, he insisted on establishing a Clan Affairs Courtyard. The old man thought far ahead; our family has benefited immensely for generations."
The old man, confused, turned around to look but saw only an empty stern and calm waters flowing. There was no sign of his guest, leaving a void in his heart.
When he turned back, he noticed a small piece of bright silver reflecting light on the small table.
The wind on the river was brisk, and the silver shimmered dazzlingly. The old man drank the rest of his wine and sat down slowly, breaking out in a cold sweat.
