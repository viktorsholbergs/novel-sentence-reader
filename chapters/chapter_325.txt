Li Tongya held the sword in his left hand, pointing it diagonally toward the ground. The puddles on the stone bricks reflected the green and white glow, while the white flesh on the stones and broken tiles moved toward the center. The words from that mouth changed Li Tongya's previously calm expression into one of uneasy resentment.
The wriggling flesh had already formed Fahui's head. As the Wrathful Maha slowly possessed him, his features became more refined and handsome, his eyes deepening to a striking gold. His face smoothed out, and those intense golden eyes locked directly with Li Tongya's as he angrily said, "Avoidance! You are avoiding your guilt toward your father and brothers. You honored your deceased brother and elevated his orphan, but the cost falls on me to bear. Li Tongya! How am I at fault?"
"Silence!!"
Li Tongya's voice roared like thunder, his lips turning white and trembling slightly. The sword in his hand emitted a sharp, whistling sound, like the cry of a serpent dragon, causing all the insects and birds in Mount Bianyan to fall silent.
Buzz—
The azure-white sword light surged out, crystalline and transparent. Hundreds of sword qi leaped from Li Tongya's Qingche Sword, crashing down like a waterfall. The puppet clay figure instantly turned to ashes and the entire mountaintop shook violently.
Boom…!
The dazzling green and white sword aura flashed for five full breaths. The sweeping sword qi transformed the ruins into a mess of holes and further wreckage. The rainwater on the platform flowed backward, turning into a misty, pale white vapor, creating an ethereal scene.
"Hahahahaha!"
The rain continued pouring heavily, quickly filling the central pit with gray water. Fahui's white head was covered with numerous fresh red wounds, exposing dark golden bones beneath. His deep golden eyes, almost falling out of their sockets, still blazed with anger as he glared at Li Tongya.
"It is useless. The Wrathful Subduer of the Four Demon Emperors is returning from the void. You could shatter me before, but now you can only see my bones. Soon, you will not even be able to harm my flesh!"
Fahui's arms had already regrown, picking up his shoulders and head from the ground. He took a few tentative steps forward, looking quite horrifying indeed. The wounds on his face healed rapidly. He turned his head and smiled maniacally.
"Father… do you agree or not?"
Li Tongya watched him intently, the sword in his hand glowing with mana light, his eyes simmering with anger. Fahui saw that his spell had affected Li Tongya's mind, yet he showed no intention of fleeing.
With an angry smile, tears streamed from his eyes as he gritted his teeth, "You wanted me to watch over the younger generation, so I abandoned my cultivation to protect them. You wanted me to oversee the mines, so I left the immortal mountain for that barren place. After I finally achieved the Qi Cultivation Realm, you made me escort spirit goods, and in the end, you sent me to die! Mother cultivated for many years, and you never gave her extra resources. You gave them all to Li Xuanfeng and those from the generation of Yuan and Qing. The few pills and elixirs she used were provided by me and the Liu Family. When she was dying, you simply said that it was all right…"
Fahui's face had morphed into that of Li Xuanling, and his voice matched perfectly. His angry gaze compelled Li Tongya to avert his eyes slightly. The old man appeared dazed, the sword in his hand flickering as his once sharp gaze grew weak, yet he remained silent.
Seeing him silent, Fahui pulled his legs out of the ground, and picked up the two intricately patterned bronze rods. He boldly took a step forward, swinging them at Li Tongya.
Clang…!
The dark golden short rods that were covered in complex patterns lit up brilliantly with golden light. The green and white sword light collided with them, sparking fiercely. The halo behind Fahui's head grew more intense as they fought on. Li Tongya's sword clashed with him for a few moves, forcing Fahui to retreat half a step.
"Heh…"
The golden hue in Fahui's eyes intensified. His facial features constantly changed—from Li Xuanling to a bearded man, then to a young child, a middle-aged woman, and a naive girl. His face cycled through these nine visages continuously. Li Tongya, unsettled by the display, drew his sword defensively, his expression reflecting his mounting confusion.
Golden light reappeared all around him, wrapping around Fahui's body like long and thick ribbons. A resonant chant filled the air, solemn and majestic.
"Ha!"
Fahui's body was covered in dense golden patterns and his bronze-colored skin reflected the rainwater falling from the sky. His face kept shifting among nine visages, each marked by an expression of anger. The short rods in his hands radiated golden light as he swung them down fiercely at Li Tongya.
A Buddhist Master Monk was inherently stronger than a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Furthermore, Fahui was a Maha Reincarnate. Now, awakened to his wrathful form, his aura was comparable to that of the Merciful One. When the short rods collided with the Qingche Sword, a harsh screeching sound filled the air. Li Tongya grunted as the impact sent him flying backward like an arrow through the rain, coming to a stop far away.
"Perfect timing, consuming you will restore my Maha status!"
The Wrathful Maha feared Li Tongya might escape, so he stamped heavily on the ground, instantly closing the distance between them. His golden arm swung out like a statue's, reaching out to grasp Li Tongya with five fingers.
Naturally, Li Tongya swung his Qingche Sword to block him while performing hand seals with his other hand. The Boundless Ocean within him surged, gathering the rainwater and forming blue serpent dragons that pounced on Fahui.
Screeeeech…!
The Wrathful Maha's fingers closed around Li Tongya's sword, emitting a piercing noise. The Qingche Sword, a top-quality Foundation Establishment Realm weapon, blazed with dazzlingly bright light.
"Jing Dragon King."
The Wrathful Maha, having lived for nine lives, recognized the Boundless Ocean by its ancient name. He chuckled, his deep golden eyes fixed on Li Tongya as he spoke in an otherworldly voice that resonated like the ocean waves.
"Your swordsmanship is passable, but your immortal spells are severely lacking!"
The Li Family, having only ascended to prominence over the past sixty years, relied solely on their mastery of swordsmanship and possessed no powerful spells. The Wrathful Maha released the sword and tore the serpent dragons apart. His golden ribbons sprang forth like snakes, swiftly wrapping around Li Tongya's body. With Li Tongya thus ensnared, the Wrathful Maha rained punches down on him relentlessly.
Bang, bang, bang…!
In just a few breaths, the Wrathful Maha had thrown a hundred punches. Li Tongya tried to defend and create distance, but the golden ribbons had already wrapped around his feet unforgivingly, binding him tightly.
Pfft.
Li Tongya endured a hundred punches delivered with the force of a Merciful One, his skin bursting open as his internal organs sustained severe damage. He spat out blood, drenching his entire body crimson, before collapsing limply to the ground.
"Your fate is sealed! I return to my place!" The Wrathful Maha laughed, his body radiating golden light. He punched Li Tongya's abdomen, his eyes blazing with light.
Grasping Li Tongya, he brought his face close to his and inhaled deeply. The golden runes in his palms lit up. The remaining whites of his eyes turned completely deep gold, and he burst into laughter, cackling wildly in a crazed manner.
"Gwaa… Hahaha… Hahaha."
The Wrathful Maha's laughter boomed, echoing between heaven and earth. In front of him, Li Tongya coughed, his face smeared with blood, yet a faint smile curled his lips as he let out a weak laugh in response.
The Wrathful Maha froze, the handsome smile stiffening on his face. Shock and anger surged within him. He slowly lifted his head and looked into the distance.
The torrential rain continued pouring down heavily, the world was dim and lightless. The puddles on the ground reflected the sky, where one by one, beams of light began to appear.
"One, two, three… seven, eight, nine."
