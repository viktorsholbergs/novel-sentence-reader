An Zheyan cupped his fist, then answered in a calm tone.
"To kill Yu Mugao."
"Hmm." Li Tongya chuckled inwardly, maintaining a slight smile on his face. He then softly said, "If Brother Zheyan has come for this matter, then please leave."
"Ling'er, please see the guest out," Li Tongya called out. Right away, Li Xuanling, who had been silently standing in the corner, stepped forward.
An Zheyan hurriedly waved his hand, hastily saying, "Brother Tongya, please hear me out!"
Since Li Tongya did not plan to dismiss him so unceremoniously, he turned his head at his plea.
An Zheyan quickly continued, "Brother Tongya! Although your family is protected by a Sword Immortal and no one dares to look down upon it, the Yu Family has long harbored intentions to sweep across Moongaze Lake… Even if they dare not openly annex your family, they will certainly not refrain from acting in the shadows! Yu Mugao wouldn't dare target Brother Tongya directly, but it's entirely possible for him to hire a few foreign cultivators, rogue cultivators, and outer sect disciples to secretly assassinate your clan's disciples! They'll only be at ease when all your family's promising juniors meet untimely ends."
"Though the Sword Immortal's cultivation is profound, he is far in the southern border. The Yu Family also has backing within the sect… As long as they leave no evidence, the Qingsui Sword Immortal can't possibly cross thousands of li to act for one or two mysteriously deceased juniors."
An Zheyan laid out these points bluntly, causing Li Tongya to frown deeply.
"Brother Zheyan seems to know quite a bit about the Yu Family," he remarked with a grave tone.
Rather than persuading Li Tongya, An Zheyan's words only raised more suspicions in his mind. Living as neighbors for so many years, both sides had their spies in each other's territories, and Li Tongya was somewhat aware of An Zheyan's actions.
Yu Mugao is indeed ruthless enough to do such a thing, but An Zheyan has always been selfish and stingy, not someone who typically thinks in such grand terms… Why is he suddenly speaking like this today?
Seeing Li Tongya silent, An Zheyan thought he had swayed him and pressed on. "Even if one does not provoke the tiger, the tiger may still harbor the intent to harm. Although your family resides peacefully on its land, if the Yu Family wishes to monopolize the Moongaze Lake, they will inevitably need to suppress your family. Unable to find a way to deal with Brother Tongya directly, they will certainly plot against the younger generation in your family."
Li Tongya shook his head, finding an excuse to reply in a stern voice, "Both Yu Mugao and Yu Mujian are of good talent. Not to mention Yu Xiaogui who is at the Foundation Establishment Realm, several members of their generation of Xiao are also at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. There is no need for them to fear my Li Family. I will say it again, Brother Zheyan, if you have come for this matter, there's no need to speak further. Please leave."
An Zheyan, seeing that Li Tongya was indeed unmoved, did not panic but spoke softly, "Every word I've spoken is true, and Brother Tongya knows it. If your family doesn't believe me, just wait a few more years, and you will understand the value of my warning."
After cupping his fist, he rode the wind away, leaving Li Tongya standing there for a while. Li Xuanling approached hesitantly, whispering, "I find his words quite reasonable; we should be cautious."
Li Tongya, with a furrowed brow, sat back down. He was feeling increasingly uneasy. After pondering for a moment, he responded, "Those words aren't something An Zheyan would come up with on his own… This must be An Jingming's idea."
He then recalled Yu Mugao's character and thought about the close relationship between the An and Yu families. Li Tongya felt somewhat troubled and spoke after some time, his voice soft.
"Given Yu Mugao's nature, he would indeed do such a thing… I'm sure he'll target not only our family. An Jingming must also be on his mind, hence An Zheyan is rushing to find someone to deal with Yu Mugao."
Li Xuanling, who was standing by, frowned and replied, "But that man is always guarded by peak Qi Cultivators when he leaves home… he's not easy to kill. Doing so would just offend the Yu Family for no reason."
Li Tongya nodded and advised, "This is an impractical matter. For now, let's ensure our younger family members don't leave our territory, and wait until the Xiao Family finishes executing their plans. By then, we may be able to borrow the Xiao Family's strength and no longer allow the Yu Family to dominate unchecked."
Li Xuanling noted his words. Li Tongya looked at the sky and instructed, "Now that we have Snake Essence Pills, I can try to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Although it's been only two to three years since my last breakthrough and it's a bit rushed, there's no other choice. I must try to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before turning sixty..."
Li Xuanling clenched his teeth, his eyes filled with deep worry. After composing his thoughts for a long while, he finally spoke with unease, "I have heard that the breakthrough from Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm is fraught with danger, almost a nine in ten chance of death. With Father being a late-stage Qi Cultivator, you are the pillar of our family. I'm afraid..."
His voice trailed off.
Li Tongya was initially startled, then sighed deeply. Looking at his son, now a father himself with a fully grown beard, he felt somewhat comforted and responded, "I have only consumed three pills and one talisman qi in my cultivation journey, relying solely on diligent practice without taking any precious medicines or spirit items like those in the three sects and seven gates do. This breakthrough indeed carries a high risk of death..."
Seeing Li Xuanling's worried gaze, Li Tongya reassured him with a warm smile, "But I have been earnestly cultivating day and night, aiming to reach Foundation Establishment Realm before I turn sixty, even if it's just a slightly better chance. If our Li Family wishes to advance further, we must have a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. In this vast Moongaze Lake, only those at the Foundation Establishment Realm can truly make their voices heard. With the prestige of your fourth uncle, our Li Family will be worry-free for the next fifty years… It's the perfect opportunity to attempt the Foundation Establishment Realm. If I fail and perish, the Yu Family won't trouble us too much and lower their guard instead."
"I understand."
Li Xuanling cupped his fist, and Li Tongya nodded slightly before stepping out of the courtyard and flying toward Meiche Peak in the south.
Li Xuanling watched with concern, hoping that the day Li Tongya's attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm would come later rather than sooner.
In Lijing Town, the biggest and most lavish residence was not that of Li Xuanxuan at the foot of the mountain. Compared by size and splendor, Li Xuanxuan's residence would likely be ranked lower. The residences of clan uncles and elders are among the top, followed by the Chen, Liu, Ren, and Tian families, with Li Xuanxuan's coming last.
Chen Donghe, who had been guarding Mount Huaqian for years and cultivating with the aid of the spirit spring on the mountain, rarely returned home. To his surprise, the Chen Family's estate had expanded significantly, now housing over three hundred family members. Without a map listing names, it would be almost impossible to find someone.
As he approached the courtyard, firecrackers sounded. He noticed that people lined both sides. His only surviving brother, now over fifty and considered the head of the household, waited respectfully at the entrance.
A boy in a padded jacket stared at him intently, recognized by Chen Donghe's spiritual sense as the special child the family had called him back for.
