Li Yuanjiao and Yuan Chengdun waited for a while. A fierce demonic wind blew in from the south, causing sand and pebbles to swirl in the valley. A black demonic mist surged from the horizon, and at the forefront stood a burly man wielding a white bone hammer.
Behind him were several demonic creatures, all of various strange appearances—a wolf and a deer flanked a pig demon in the center as they descended to the ground. Hidden in the Profound Patterned Bottle's mist, Li Yuanjiao performed a hand seal.
BOOM!
The group of demons joyously landed, triggering the Foundation Establishment Realm formation. A green light barrier rose around them, completely isolating them from their surroundings.
The Foundation Establishment Realm demon barely managed to keep its composure while the lesser demons, still in the Qi Cultivation Realm, were terrified. Some stumbled, and others tried to flee.
This Foundation Establishment Realm formation was from an artifact carried by Kong Tingyun, a direct disciple of Profound Peak Gate.
The lesser demons were instantly thrown into disarray. As they struggled in confusion, Yuan Chengdun silently emerged from the black mist, removing the two short rods from his back and delivering a heavy strike without uttering a word.
Golden-blue light flickered around him as his immortal foundation Sprawling Azure Mountain activated. With a heavy stomp on the ground and a swing of his two short rods, Yuan Chengdun shattered the bones of the wolf demon, breaking it into pieces seemingly effortlessly. The other rod struck the deer demon, causing its head to shatter into fragments, its blood splattering everywhere.
They would have made good Qi Cultivation Realm sacrificial offerings!
Seeing Yuan Chengdun kill two demons so swiftly, Li Yuanjiao feared he might continue the slaughter. He quickly maneuvered through the black mist, extending his hand to draw the Qingche Sword from its sheath, the sharp green-white blade gleaming menacingly.
Yuan Chengdun also rushed forward, his short rods gleaming with golden light as fine golden patterns emerged on his face. With a cold expression, he attacked the Foundation Establishment Realm pig demon which was shrouded in dark mist, angrily muttering and raising its bone hammer to block his attacks. The clash with Li Yuanjiao's sword arc produced a harsh, grating sound.
Yuan Chengdun ignored the demon's resistance, his short rods carrying formidable power as he skillfully executed his strikes.
The pig demon, caught between two formidable opponents, was in dire straits. It opened its mouth wide and unleashed a wave of demonic mist, hoping to fend off Yuan Chengdun's assault.
"What crude demonic art! You dare show this off?!" Yuan Chengdun laughed as the golden light of Sprawling Azure Mountain easily dispersed the mist. His rods then struck the pig demon's chest, causing it to spit blood and struggle to maintain its form, its body beginning to swell as it reverted to its original form.
Li Yuanjiao was about to intervene when Yuan Chengdun called out, "No need to interfere, fellow Daoist! It has been a while since I have had the pleasure of pummeling such a clumsy and thick-skinned pig demon… Let me savor this!"
Li Yuanjiao paused for a moment before smiling and stepping back, allowing Yuan Chengdun to continue in his pleasures.
In the dark mist, a golden light shone brightly as the pig demon transformed into a massive creature the size of a grand hall, its black fur-like armor with its green eyes glowing ominously.
Yuan Chengdun remained unfazed, wielding his short rods like hammers. Despite their relatively small size compared to the pig demon, he struck with full force, and the demon, using all its strength, barely managed to block the attacks while shouting loudly, "Sprawling Azure Mountain?! What did I do to offend your Yuan Family that you traveled so far to ambush me?!"
The pig demon noticed Li Yuanjiao but did not associate him with the Li Family. After all, if the Li Family wanted him dead, Li Tongya would have come, and the pig demon would have already been chopped into pieces. There would be no need for such elaborate schemes.
Yuan Chengdun simply replied with a grin, "How many man-eating demons have fallen to my short rods? Whether you offended our family or not, it does not matter!"
The pig demon, with its tough skin and thick hide, could not escape and was beaten relentlessly, crying out in pain and spitting blood.
Sprawling Azure Mountain truly lives up to its reputation, Li Yuanjiao thought to himself.
Yuan Chengdun's way of wielding the rods was unusual, holding them by the ends as if they were short hammers, striking with resounding force. Li Yuanjiao watched closely, noticing the skill in Yuan Chengdun's technique, and could not help but advise, "Hold back a bit, fellow Daoist! Do not kill it!"
As he spoke, a spring of grayish-green water gushed from the ground beneath his feet as a black water serpent coiled and spread out, capturing all the Qi Cultivation Realm demons trembling within the formation.
This rod technique is more than meets the eye… Li Yuanjiao thought as he observed more closely.
Yuan Chengdun's rod technique was likely a legacy passed down from the Yuan Family's connection with Yanyang Temple in the north and was at least a Grade Four technique. It was ancient and powerful, easily beating the pig demon into wailing submission.
Sprawling Azure Mountain must be an immortal foundation similar to Jade Court General, enhancing the body and excelling in combat arts...
After watching for a while, Li Yuanjiao heard the soft sounds of water as the Jing Dragon King returned, dragging along a few Qi Cultivation Realm demons.
"One at the late stage of Qi Cultivation Realm, and two at the early stage..."
The difference between the Foundation Establishment Realm and the Qi Cultivation Realm was like that between mortals and immortals. Li Yuanjiao glanced at them briefly and lost interest, focusing instead on the pig demon that was still howling in pain.
"My commander is of the demon den's direct lineage, sent here on a mission! You better know your place... Ah!"
The pig demon was struck a few more times as its eyes reddened with fury, and its aura surged as it opened its mouth wide, spewing a blood-red torrent filled with countless skulls and bones that all rushed toward Yuan Chengdun.
Yuan Chengdun remained unperturbed, flicking his finger to release a large, crystalline hide. With just a flick, it captured the blood-red river, causing it to crash to the ground like a dead snake, writhing for a moment before going still.
Yuan Chengdun continued his onslaught, switching through several rod techniques as the pig demon, beaten within an inch of its life, collapsed to the ground.
"In just the time it takes for an incense stick to burn... Your rod technique is truly impressive, fellow Daoist!" Li Yuanjiao praised.
Yuan Chengdun, slightly perspiring but in high spirits, replied, "My immortal foundation disperses demonic essence, leaving it unable to cast spells or perform techniques. Its body and artifacts are inferior to mine, and with the formation blocking any escape, it naturally met this fate."
Li Yuanjiao descended lightly, sealing the acupoints and Dao foundation of the pig demon. The black serpent dragon surged, binding all the small demons together before he stowed away the formation plate.
Yuan Chengdun smiled slightly, just about to take his leave when both of them suddenly fell silent.
A man stood just outside the formation.
He appeared to be a middle-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation in his late thirties or early forties. He wore a mismatched Daoist robe, his skin slightly tanned, and his pupils were vertical slits like those of a serpent dragon, emitting a reddish-brown glow as he quietly observed the two men.
Li Yuanjiao and Yuan Chengdun immediately became vigilant. The Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator spoke in a hoarse voice, "A member of the Li Family?"
Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and nodded.
"And you are..?"
The man, wary of Yuan Chengdun, softened his tone, "An old acquaintance from Mount Yue... I am Fei Luoya. How is Daoist Tongya doing these days?"
"Ah, it's you, Senior Fei Luoya! I am Li Yuanjiao."
Li Yuanjiao immediately understood. This man was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator left from Mount Wu and a close neighbor of the Li Family, the Mount Yue cultivator Fei Luoya.
Years ago, this person appeared when the Li Family made Eastern Mount Yue their vassal. Granduncle Li Tongya, borrowing the reputation of the sword immortal upheld by the families of Xiao and Fei, deterred him. Later, they even traded valuable medicines with him. They had some dealings in the past.
Having been fighting on someone else's territory for quite a while, it was no surprise that this Mount Yue cultivator had come to investigate. Li Yuanjiao apologized a few times, but Fei Luoya waved it off, saying in a low voice, "And this is?"
"Yuan Chengdun of the Yuan Family from Mushroom Forest Plain," Yuan Chengdun replied steadily, "I was sent by the elders of my clan to assist the Li Family in slaying demons."
Fei Luoya nodded in understanding, his hoarse voice continuing, "As it happens, I have something I wish to discuss with you."
Yuan Chengdun cupped his fist and tactfully announced, "Now that this matter is resolved, I shall take my leave."
With the mirror in hand and a good sense of the character of the people of Mount Yue, Li Yuanjiao had no fear of letting him go.
Fei Luoya began, "Daoist Tongya's fame for slaying the Maha is truly impressive. Although I live in this poor and remote place, I have heard of it as well. I wonder..."
Li Yuanjiao had avoided this topic once before, but seeing that Fei Luoya was fixated on it, he replied, "The ancestor is currently in seclusion."
