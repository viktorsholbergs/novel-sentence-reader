Li Yuanjiao was witnessing Supreme Yin Moonlight outside of his family's residence for the first time. Encased in a silver-plated ancient jade bottle adorned with ancient talismans, it was placed reverently on a jade platform, further shielded by an ancient spirit barrier. Even in this grotto heaven, it was clear this object was treated with the utmost respect.
The jade platform was intricately carved with various formations, suggesting it was once used to assist cultivation or extract secondary spiritual qi. However, these formations had long since lost their functionality, now appearing as mere decorative patterns.
In his family's secret chamber, where streams of moonlight essence flowed freely, Li Yuanjiao had grown accustomed to its silvery glow. It was ordinary to him—almost mundane.
Yet, when placed in this ceremonial setting, its rarity and value became strikingly evident. The silver-white radiance was dazzling. Li Yuanjiao remained composed, but the cultivators around the platform began to recognize the item. The atmosphere quickly grew tense.
The Jiangnan region had once been the site of the Moonlight Origin Mansion, with its Daoist legacy passed down through generations of immortal sects. Each family guarded its collection of ancient techniques, smithing methods, and divine abilities, making such treasures highly coveted. Even if one couldn't use it personally, delivering it to a Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master would bring immense rewards.
The gathered cultivators' eyes grew bloodshot, their greed palpable. Only a few retained their composure, and even those few seemed less immune to temptation than ignorant of the object's true nature.
Among them, the tall and slender Xun Yizi, dressed in dark Daoist robes, was the first to recognize the treasure. He gripped the corner of his robe with one hand while clutching a purple sandalwood duster in the other. His wide, unblinking eyes seemed ready to fall from their sockets.
Sweeping his gaze across the crowd, Xun Yizi spoke first, saying, "There are six of us here, four from the three sects and seven gates of Yue State. If this treasure is to be shared, it should remain with Yue State. Overseas cultivators would do well to leave immediately!"
His words carried an obvious implication. Both Zhong Qian and the red-robed man's expressions shifted subtly. The red-robed man sneered and retorted, "Xun Yizi, your petty schemes are laughable. Trying to drive others away with vague words—how dare you bring such trickery to the table? I, for one, will flip the table over!"
Laughing aloud, he cupped his fist toward the surrounding five people and declared, "Let it be known to all: this treasure is none other than the long-lost Supreme Yin Moonlight! The ancient texts mention it under names such as Veiled Supreme Yin Qi, Great Moonlight Instrument, or even Extreme Yin. They all refer to this very item!"
The booming voice echoed across the clouds, causing a ripple of spiritual energies to stir nearby. It was as if the speaker feared no one would recognize the object and loudly proclaimed its identity, watching the surrounding cultivators' expressions of shock and awe with a triumphant laugh.
"Guo Hong'er!" The face of Xun Yizi, clad in dark robes, darkened severely. He muttered the name under his breath, while the red-robed man, unperturbed, casually dusted off his robes and slid a token into his sleeve.
With an indifferent hum, he turned and walked away, "Fight amongst yourselves as you will. Consider this my courtesy to all of you—Crimson Reef Island will not be joining the fray!"
His parting words left Xun Yizi seething with rage, his fury plain as he realized the trap Guo Hong'er had laid for him. The glances from the others surrounding the platform told him that there would be no peaceful resolution now.
The tension hung thick in the air for several moments before a young cultivator dressed in black cupped his fist respectfully and said, "Such treasures are beyond my means. I shall not involve myself in this matter."
The speaker was none other than Zhong Qian. Known for his low profile, he clearly recognized the immense trouble possession of this item would bring. Without hesitation, he turned and flew off.
Xun Yizi scanned the remaining four individuals and the faint, hidden presences lingering in the clouds above. He spoke in a deep tone, "If anyone here withdraws, consider it a personal favor to Xun Yizi of the Changxiao Gate."
His plea fell flat, eliciting little response. The cultivators stood silently, their gazes fixed intently on the silver-shrouded treasure atop the jade platform. Realizing diplomacy had failed, Xun Yizi abruptly sprang into action, his hand reaching for the object.
BOOM!
A thunderous explosion erupted as five or six artifacts flew toward him, intercepting his grasp. Expecting resistance, Xun Yizi feinted, drawing back his outstretched hand and instead attacking a nearby cultivator with his purple sandalwood duster.
"You!" The cultivator yelped.
Chaos unfolded as beams of light shot across the sky, their radiance interweaving in dazzling displays. Several cultivators unleashed their Immortal Foundations, their artifacts clashing with deafening force.
Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao and Tu Longjian remained aloft, silently observing the unfolding battle. Tu Longjian squinted, his spiritual sense weaving in and out as it exchanged information with the token hanging at his waist. He waited for the opportune moment.
Li Yuanjiao swept his gaze across the field and spotted Kong Tingyun using her jade orb to block incoming attacks. She stood quietly at the battlefield's edge, one hand supporting the small golden mountain she seemed to be weighing, considering where to hurl it.
Having witnessed the devastating effects of Kong Tingyun's golden mountain before, Li Yuanjiao knew its unanticipated power, especially against spellcasting cultivators.
Tu Longjian hoisted his slender, pole-like golden hammer, appearing ready to strike. Li Yuanjiao spoke softly, "Fellow Daoist, that cultivator from the Profound Peak Gate is an old acquaintance of mine. Perhaps we could coordinate our efforts."
Tu Longjian nodded in understanding. "Let us strike now. None of them seem particularly formidable."
He wasted no time. Tu Longjian hoisted his golden hammer and descended with the wind, streaking downward like a bolt of lightning.
Tu Longjian's hammer was an unusual dharma artifact, slender and elongated. The hammerhead itself was only about half the size of an average human head, while the shaft more closely resembled a spear or polearm. Its design made it seem less like a traditional hammer and more like a long-handled weapon as it swung downward with precision.
The golden-robed cultivator below, his affiliation unknown, caught sight of the descending hammer. His expression shifted instantly to shock and fear as he recognized the descending figure, Tu Longjian!
Abandoning the spell he had been casting, he ignored his opponent entirely and slapped the jade pendant at his waist. Streams of light surged upward from his body and coalesced into a formidable shield.
A sharp, shattering sound rang out as the shield splintered and dissolved into dust under the hammer's force. Tu Longjian pursued his target without pause, striking with relentless precision. Within a dozen exchanges, the cultivator took a heavy blow to the chest, spat out blood, and fled into the cloud sea, vanishing without a backward glance.
Li Yuanjiao recalled Tu Longjian's earlier words and decided not to intervene. Instead, he activated the Profound Patterned Spirit Mist, edging slowly toward the battlefield's periphery.
As he approached, a woman in a pale yellow-green feathered robe turned sharply toward him, her voice cold and alert, "Who goes there?"
Li Yuanjiao subtly revealed the outline of the Profound Patterned Spirit Mist. The woman, Kong Tingyun, hesitated, her expression uncertain. "Brother Yuanjiao?"
"It is me," he replied calmly.
Kong Tingyun's tension eased, her face lighting up with a mix of relief and surprise. "You made it in as well! At least I have someone to rely on now... You should be careful—this place is full of hidden dangers."
Li Yuanjiao hovered midair, speaking evenly. "I entered with a companion to gather qi on the island. We had not expected to end up here."
