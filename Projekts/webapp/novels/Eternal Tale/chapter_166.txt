Within Nine Palaces Mountain, Chen Xun and the big black ox tidied up everything, leaving a note in the kitchen before disappearing into the boundless darkness.
On the road, they did not travel by air but used their movement techniques to weave through the deep mountain forests, heading toward the Tianduan Great Plain.
"Moo!!" The big black ox kept crying out in surprise along the way, occasionally rubbing against Chen Xun, still unable to calm down.
The cultivators they had encountered so far were not the type to reason with. Even if their cultivation levels were similar, they often compared backgrounds and ended up fighting.
Chen Xun held its ox head, speaking with a heavy heart, "Old Ox, it seems that Nascent Soul cultivators are different from ordinary ones."
"Moo~" The big black ox snorted, feeling much more relaxed.
It looked at Chen Xun in confusion, wondering why he didn't seem very happy.
"Having dealt with ordinary cultivators so often, I underestimated the Nascent Soul ancestors. They exceeded my expectations."
"Moo?"
"First, that flower is the most precious item of the Moon Tower and a specialty of Nine Palaces Mountain, yet Old Ancestor Jinyu gave it away without hesitation." Chen Xun squinted slightly. "Second, that probing force wasn't testing our strength; she was confirming our cultivation levels."
"Moo moo?"
"I couldn't comprehend the Nascent Soul power, but she definitely didn't use her full strength and certainly figured something out."
"Moo~~" The big black ox pretended to think, but it just felt that the Nascent Soul ancestor was quite reasonable.
"That phrase _'If you need anything, come to Nine Palaces Mountain.'_ Damn, does she see through us?" Chen Xun's heart skipped a beat. "Nascent Soul techniques could be sought from her? Damn it..."
"Moo!!" The big black ox cried out in horror. Could it be that Chen Xun had been seen through?
"But her words were so ambiguous, maintaining both advance and retreat, leaving no room for error. She's quite like me." Chen Xun nodded slightly, stroking his chin. "Fortunately, we planned carefully and waited for the best opportunity, or this matter wouldn't have been resolved so quickly."
The big black ox patted Chen Xun, its eyes filled with admiration for its elder brother.
Having spent so many years patiently waiting for the best opportunity, there was still much to learn from his elder brother.
"Old Ox, you can't be careless in the cultivation world." Chen Xun tilted his head, glancing sideways at the big black ox's expression, feeling quite satisfied. "Stay with your elder brother, and there will be a place for you, Black Ox, among the Nascent Soul ancestors."
"Moo!!" The big black ox kept rubbing against Chen Xun, its mouth almost splitting into a smile.
"Hahaha, let's head to the Tianduan Great Plain!
"Moo moo!!"
Their arrogant howls echoed through the mountains and forests along the way, scaring many Qi Refining stage demonic beasts into trembling in their nests.
However, this trip to Nine Palaces Mountain also served as a warning to Chen Xun.
These Nascent Soul ancestors, who rose among countless prodigies, each had deep thoughts and were far from naive.
Moreover, to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, there is also the Heart Tribulation. This is the main reason why countless Golden Core cultivators fall short of the Nascent Soul path.
Gold separates from the sand, spiritual roots merely determine the path of cultivation, but they are never the only factor.
...
Two years later, in the western part of Qian Nation, the Tianduan Great Plain. An endless expanse, a dead sea of sand, majestic, serene, forever monotonous in color.
Yellow, yellow, forever the scorching yellow, as if the world had solidified the turbulent waves and towering swells here.
"Eternal life is truly wonderful~ truly marvelous~~"
"Moo~~"
"Eternal life is truly great~ truly great~~"
"Moo moo~~"
"I am an alchemist~ you are a formation master~~"
"Moo moo moo~~~"
The morning sun cast its rays on the endless plain, the wind suddenly rose, sand waves leaped, stirring up a spray of golden particles, and two figures gradually appeared.
Chen Xun, wearing a worn straw hat, sat cross-legged on the big black ox's back, his loud singing shaking the surrounding sands.
The ox, also wearing a tattered straw hat, continually howled in chorus. This song by his elder brother was quite good.
Although it seemed to walk slowly, each step covered a thousand feet, leaving faint afterimages on the ground, ethereal and elusive.
"Old Ox, begin submerging and set up the formation." Chen Xun looked around and spoke in a booming voice, "Start cultivating spirit herbs and refine the Nurturing Pill!"
"Moo moo~" The big black ox howled to the sky and began submerging with Chen Xun.
They had prepared everything along the way, and this journey was even farther than the last.
**Boom!**
**_Rumble..._**
The underground was all quicksand, quite strange indeed. Chen Xun furrowed his brow as he observed the surroundings, sensing no spiritual energy whatsoever.
It was as if everything had been eroded and drained, which, at his current peak Golden Core realm, he could vaguely discern.
"Old Ox."
"Moo?"
"There's no spiritual energy on the border cities, but near the Tianduan Great Plain, Yuxu City has spiritual energy, though it relies on a Gathering Spirit Array." Chen Xun grabbed a handful of sand and observed it. "It's very strange. Yuxu City's location isn't ideal either."
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox danced around excitedly, "Moo moo moo!!"
"Do you think it wasn't like this before?"
"Moo moo moo~"
"At least when the city was built, the Tianduan Great Plain was not like this!
"Moo!" The big black ox's eyes gleamed with intelligence as it nodded. It naturally possessed a spiritual sense, and perhaps this place had spiritual energy before
"I swear, Old Ox, did you notice last time? We've been here for twenty years, but the spiritual energy consumption is definitely higher than in Qian Nation."
Chen Xun's eyelids twitched as he continued examining the sand. "Could it be that something in the Tianduan Great Plain is eroding the spiritual energy?"
"Moo~~~" The big black ox let out a long snort, indicating that it was indeed possible.
"Could there be a super Gathering Spirit Array? Sucking away our spiritual energy? Damn it." Chen Xun exploded in anger. How many unjust low-grade spirit stones would it take to restore his spiritual energy? "Old Ox, you understand formations, is this what's happening?"
"Moo!" The big black ox also exclaimed in shock. They had always been careful with their spiritual energy usage, and they could sense even subtle changes.
Indeed, something was amiss. After comparing, they had spent at least a hundred more low-grade spirit stones over the twenty years. It shook its head again, feeling no trace of any formation power. It seemed like it had always been this way, naturally so.
"In countless years, won't the spiritual energy in Qian Nation diminish more and more?!" Chen Xun raised an eyebrow. They would live long enough to see that era. "No wonder the Top Ten Sects are leading the exploration of the Northern Region."
Although the erosion of spiritual energy here was slow, with the passage of time, the spiritual energy across various places might even dry up.
"Moo~" The big black ox thought quickly, finding his elder brother's words very reasonable.
Moreover, with the Top Ten Sects having ancient inheritances and Nascent Soul cultivators being quite intelligent, they should have long discovered this issue.
The big black ox exhaled deeply, looking at Chen Xun, slowly lifting its hoof and giving a thumbs-up.
"Old Ox, you see, as our realms advance, our perspectives and horizons instantly open up." Chen Xun snorted coldly, flicking the sand away. "When it comes to the Nascent Soul seat, it will be occupied by none other than me, Chen Xun, the Patriarch!"
"Moo~~~!" The big black ox trembled with excitement. He and his elder brother were finally going to make it.
"Old Ox, let's go!"
"Moo!"
**Boom...**
After a day and night, Chen Xun took out his mountain-opening axe and began to open up the cave, while the big black ox set up the Five Elements Array to stabilize the surroundings, their coordination seamless.
They also began cultivating spirit herbs together. Rare and precious spirit herbs that exceeded the usual pill formulations gradually grew.
In the underground cave, strange laughter often echoed, along with the fiery glow of the Crane Spirit Tree burning.
Unconsciously, the Crane Spirit Tree had become a companion to Chen Xun and the big black ox, accompanying them through the ages, never to be abandoned.
One man, one ox, one tree, passing through spring, summer, autumn, and winter together in this underground cave, keeping each other company.
Above ground, the yellow sand still stretched endlessly, desolate and deserted, with no one coming and no one going.
Only the large sun lay quietly on the horizon, the sunset dyeing the sand, gradually sinking into intoxication.
