“Moo! Moo!!”
A deep and resounding bellow of a cow suddenly echoed across the heavens and earth as six terrifying figures of light began forming into a battle formation.
The giant ship roared to life, fully unleashing its power!
The branches of the Crane Spirit’s Five-Element Tree stretched further and further, sprawling out to cover the sky.
A massive, ethereal figure emerged, standing tall between heaven and earth, swaying as it radiated divine brilliance, exuding an aura of unparalleled terror.
Today, the Black Ox and the Little Crane finally unleashed their full strength!
Little Red clung tightly to Brother Crane, trembling so fiercely that its teeth chattered. Its mind had gone completely blank, utterly void of any thoughts.
Buzz
The glowing runes on the giant ship flared brightly, shooting skyward. Suddenly, the vessel accelerated, transforming into an unstoppable stream of black and white light, hurtling directly toward the boundary’s celestial veil!
“Stop them!!!”
“Hurry! Don’t let them succeed!”
“How dare you!!!”
Terrifying waves of immense energy suddenly erupted across the heavens.
Several enormous blood-stained hands materialized in the sky, crashing down as if the heavens themselves were collapsing.
Even before touching the ground, their overwhelming pressure left the air suffocating, as if being crushed beneath the weight of a thousand fathoms of ocean depth.
Within a single breath, the massive hands descended, their crushing force locking onto the ship with precision!
Suddenly!
Boom!
Two colossal arcs of deathly axe light split the sky, cutting through with unstoppable force.
The moment the deathly light met the giant hands, they exploded into a storm of blood rain that splashed across the heavens, sweeping outward with devastating power.
Even the corrupted creatures below could only look up in horror, scrambling to shield themselves from the residual shockwaves.
“Foul creatures, you’ll have to face me first.”
A cold, indifferent voice reverberated through the skies. Chen Xun stood tall, his twin axes crossed before him. His deep eyes peered into the depths of the unknown, their meaning unfathomable.
“Kill him.”
“He’s no living being.”
Two voices, laced with boundless hatred and loathing, echoed across the battlefield. The energies they carried surpassed even the mid-stage Nascent Soul level.
Chen Xun’s expression grew solemn. There were too many—more than just these two.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
An unprecedented upheaval erupted. As the corrupted creatures prepared to strike, their bodies momentarily froze. The giant ship had crashed directly into the ancestral grounds of the Boundary Spirit!
Roar!
Screech!
“Kill!”
The endless corrupted creatures on the blackened land flew into a frenzy, charging toward Chen Xun in a desperate counterattack.
Even at the cost of their lives, they would not allow these intruders to advance any further. Today, these beings would perish!
“Moo! Moo!”
“Brother Xun, this isn’t good!”
The big black ox and Little Red shouted anxiously. From all directions, countless Nascent Soul-level corrupted creatures closed in, their auras vast and suffocating.
Even the black mountains seemed to multiply endlessly. They were completely surrounded!
But what truly drove despair was not the encirclement; it was the horrifying discovery. Despite repeated crashes into the celestial veil, it remained unscathed.
And yet, from the impacts, newly-born corrupted creatures of the Qi Refinement stage had begun to emerge, birthed directly from the grayish specks of light within.
This was the lair of the corrupted creatures. There was no path forward!
“Damn it...”
Chen Xun’s pupils constricted as he glanced at the hundreds of corrupted creatures shaken loose.
They lay motionless on the ground, showing no signs of life as if they had not fully matured.
Everyone’s hearts sank with dread. They had all been deceived; there was no path. The battlefield’s edge was merely a breeding ground for these creatures!
From the distant horizon, an endless ocean of corrupted blood churned violently. Terrifying Nascent Soul-level corrupted creatures were awakening, one after another.
Their hatred was boundless, their fearlessness absolute.
They began surging toward the ship, their bodies carrying massive black mountains. Even from afar, the biting cold of their chilling winds could be felt.
The frigid atmosphere across the battlefield swiftly dissipated, replaced by an increasingly menacing and overwhelming aura erupting from the depths of the domain.
The relentless tide of corrupted creatures surged forward, their sheer momentum like a stormy sea, leaving Chen Xun and his group under crushing pressure, gasping for air.
“Moo? Moo?!”
“Brother Xun?!”
“Retreat!”
Chen Xun’s gaze was filled with unwillingness as he scanned his surroundings. With a wave of his hand, tens of thousands of high-grade talismans vanished into the surrounding spiritual energy, while his primordial spirit rapidly retracted. There was no choice—they had to flee.
If any corrupted creatures were caught in the talisman’s blast radius, they would instantly explode into a blood mist, triggering a devastating backlash.
“Moo!”
The big black ox roared furiously. The black coffin it carried erupted with an aura of absolute dominance, unleashing waves of deathly energy to slaughter the pursuing creatures and cover the retreat.
The corrupted creatures chasing them not only had to endure the talismans’ devastation but also the erosion of deathly energy, dying in excruciating agony.
Boom!
Chen Xun landed firmly on the ship’s deck and shouted, “Old Ox, hurry!”
“Moo! Moo!”
The big black ox had already prepared. Five elemental formation flags erupted with blinding divine light, radiant and dazzling, hovering behind it. With a heavy slap on Brother Crane’s head, it activated the formation.
Buzz!
Brilliant five-element divine light illuminated the sky as dazzling beams of spiritual radiance danced. The entire space trembled violently, emitting deafening roars and earth-shattering reverberations!
Angry roars and shocked cries of countless corrupted creatures rose and fell in waves. One terrifying figure after another struck out, attempting to crush their target with overwhelming force!
In the history of the Black Earth Plains, no one had ever succeeded in setting up a teleportation array, let alone escaping from the encirclement of billions of corrupted creatures.
Buzz
A booming sound of departure reverberated. The void trembled and caved in as the giant ship vanished before the stunned eyes of the corrupted creatures.
In the instant they disappeared, countless deadly anti-life spells arrived at the spot where the ship had been.
Corrupted blood surged endlessly, flooding the heavens and earth, while all the corrupted creatures roared with rage as if their fury could reach the sky.
“Outrageous! Absolutely outrageous!”
“When did this domain give rise to such individuals? Why would the heavens create such a race?!”
“All of this is futile. The ancestral grounds of the domain are impenetrable by mere cultivators.”
“Absurd. Laughable.”
Low, sinister voices rumbled from the heavens, sending shivers down the spines of the corrupted creatures on the ground. They trembled, displaying utmost reverence, not daring to make the slightest misstep.
However, the figures in the sky, despite their arrogance, couldn’t suppress a flicker of unease in their hearts as they gazed downward—deathly energy...
This race was far too terrifying, possibly even more so than the corrupted creatures themselves. In contrast, living beings seemed pitifully insignificant.
“They cannot be allowed to survive. We corrupted creatures should be the most noble race under the heavens.”
“Agreed.”
“Our kind must find them and hunt them down!”
A wave of spiritual consciousness rippled across the land, imprinting Chen Xun and his companions' images into the minds of the corrupted creatures. Their eyes gleamed with clarity, their memories etched with startling efficiency.
Rumble.
A deafening sound echoed across the land as countless corrupt creatures began retreating. This was their sacred ground.
High above, the corrupted figures in the heavens fell into brooding silence. Their expressions twisted with anger. Before they could even decide to retaliate, something disruptive appeared.
During the ancient wars, the Nascent Soul-stage cultivators had perished alongside the Nascent Soul-stage corrupted creatures, severing a vital path for their kind near the Forbidden Sea coast.
In their final moments, those beings had laid down an ancient grand formation, one that spanned time itself, depleting the Black Earth Plain’s vitality for hundreds of thousands of years—a loss yet to be fully recovered.
But those beings had paid a heavy price as well. Their vitality had been exhausted, and now they could barely produce even a single Nascent Soul-stage cultivator. The innate resources of heaven and earth had grown increasingly scarce.
The corrupted creatures, however, had the Black Mountains, which could nourish and restore the Black Earth Plains. Given enough time, their kind would surely give birth to new Nascent Soul-stage corrupted beings.
“Everyone, continue your cultivation. The living beings of this world will never amount to anything.”
“Indeed. Their greed and cowardice have already sealed their fate.”
“Heh, dragging this out with us corrupted creatures—let’s see who can endure longer.”
The sinister voices echoed with cold laughter. They prided themselves on their cunning, believing the passage of time was in their favor.
The corrupted creatures, unafraid of death and united in purpose, possessed qualities that these detestable living beings could never match. In their eyes, this domain would inevitably belong to the corrupted.
As their voices faded, streaks of blood-red light flashed across the sky. They dispersed in all directions, each heading back to their lairs, unwilling to waste any more time on trivialities.
...
Near the forbidden coastline of the sea, a giant ship docked.
They had returned safely but were silent, each consumed by heavy thoughts.
Chen Xun pondered the path ahead. That place was certainly not a way forward. Perhaps there had once been a road, but their domain had likely been completely sealed. There was no road to take, nor a road to create.
The big black ox mulled over the origins of the corrupted creatures, snorting occasionally. This was forcing them onto a dead end!
The corrupted beings were born from that gray-blue celestial veil, which wasn’t even a formation. It couldn’t be destroyed or breached.
From the transparent veil, one could see the endless expanse beyond. There was no path there.
Little Red took a deep breath, the immature and audacious thought in its mind growing increasingly validated. Yet it felt absurd—no matter how it turned the idea over, it didn’t seem right.
“Let’s go find Baili Zhonghu. We can still grow stronger.”
Chen Xun frowned slightly, sensing that advancing further near the Heavenly River was meaningless. “Old Ox, there are at least late-stage Nascent Soul corrupted creatures at the end. Let’s prepare more. I refuse to believe there’s no way forward.”
“Moo!”
The big black ox nodded earnestly. It hadn’t even considered the issue of the road. Big Brother said there was a path, so there must be one. Their current strength was simply insufficient.
“Brother Xun, you were so fierce when you took down those corrupted creatures!”
Little Red clasped its paws together and let out a mischievous laugh. It actually preferred Brother Xun’s gentle demeanor.
Chen Xun looked at Little Red, a warm, radiant smile spreading across his face.
