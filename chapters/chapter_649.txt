"Li Encheng!" Ning Heyuan lowered his head slightly, deliberated for a moment, and then suddenly seemed to realize something. With a faint smile, he remarked, "You have certainly kept things quiet! However, this is not a simple matter. Li Encheng has offended some people in the past. If he takes action, it might backfire."
Li Xizhi nodded, feeling a bit uneasy about this potential complication. Ning Heyuan continued, "Actually, this matter is not too difficult. As for Chi Zhiyun… my brother-in-law is already preparing on that front. We can handle it. The Chi Family has no objections, and Daoist Master Yuan Xiu is preoccupied with extending his lifespan, unable to manage such matters. However… after the matter concludes, you will need to meet Chi Zhiyun personally."
Ning Heyuan hesitated briefly, then sighed, "All of this assumes success. It will take about seven or eight years to see through."
Ning Heyuan meticulously discussed the finer details with Li Xizhi for an hour before solemnly stating, "Fellow Daoist, be aware that everything hinges on the uncertainty of my aunt's breakthrough. Should she fail, there will be countless variables, and both our families will face great difficulties."
Li Xizhi nodded, indicating his understanding. Ning Heyuan escorted him to the entrance of the cave dwelling and said softly, "Our two families are now bound together. My brother-in-law has done a great deal—do not let him down."
Li Xizhi did not fully grasp the weight of "done a great deal" but nodded in acknowledgment before taking his leave.
Ning Heyuan walked him out, then turned back with a slight sense of worry, muttering to himself, "One step at a time…"
On Mount Qingdu.
Li Xuanxuan and Liu Changdie had been busy setting up the formation for a long time, constructing several formation platforms and inscribing intricate formation patterns while gradually refining the spirit waters.
This work, of course, did not require Li Xuanxuan's personal efforts. Liu Changdie guided several of the family's formation masters, who were eager to participate in the construction of such a grand formation under his mentorship. They were practically willing to pay to be part of it.
Li Xuanxuan had been observing for a while and noticed that the vegetation on the mountain seemed listless. The climate had grown warmer over the past few days, and rainfall had gradually decreased, piquing his curiosity.
Just as he was about to ask about it, he saw the clouds in the sky swept away as if by a fierce wind, dispersing in an instant. The dazzling morning light rose from the horizon, spreading endless gold and crimson hues across the heavens.
Whoosh… whoosh…
The sound of the wind echoed through the world, growing closer with each moment. A wave of warmth swept through, rustling the trees. Not only Liu Changdie but even the lower-ranked formation masters sensed something unusual and looked dumbfoundedly toward the north.
The warm wind left Li Xuanxuan momentarily stunned.
"This is…" Liu Changdie also paused mid-sentence, and the two exchanged glances before looking up at the spectacle in the sky.
The clouds that had shrouded the land for years finally dispersed, revealing a pair of deep crimson wings spanning the horizon. As the morning light ascended into the sky, it bathed the world in a fiery red glow.
A colossal feathered beast appeared from the north, its size utterly astonishing. From the mountain below, its overwhelming form seemed to stretch across the heavens, its wings extending far into the drifting sea of clouds.
The belly of the beast shadowed a significant portion of Moongaze Lake, though it did not block the morning glow. Streams of red light flowed, turning the entire lake into a radiant ruby that sparkled amidst the heavens and earth.
The feathered beast was vividly colored in shades of crimson, gold, and yellow. Its elongated feathers trailed behind it, forming eight elaborate tail plumes resembling intricate chains that stretched deep into the northern skies.
Liu Changdie's voice turned hoarse as he dared not look directly at the radiant spectacle. He muttered softly, "Senior… this is the Dry Fire opposing Pristine Water… but what kind of divine beast could it be?"
The feathered beast moved with astonishing speed, soaring across the sky. Rainwater was swept away in its wake, leaving behind blazing sunlight. The intense golden light poured onto the damp earth, shimmering as though molten gold was flowing everywhere.
The sunlight differed from the usual, resembling descending flames that seeped into the soil and vegetation, producing faint sizzling sounds. The land turned golden, almost blindingly radiant. Even the pale ground seemed to reflect this brilliance, while waves of heat surged, drenching everyone in sweat.
Li Xuanxuan managed to raise his head, feeling the ground beneath him radiate heat from within as the sunlight touched it. The evaporating rainwater filled the surroundings with thick humidity.
The Yue Cultivating Sect… has struck back! The entire Mount Qingdu and Moongaze Lake were shrouded in misty vapor, creating an ethereal, otherworldly scene. Li Xuanxuan stood amidst the swirling white mist, looking around and murmuring, "What kind of spirit beast is this?"
Liu Changdie squinted as he gazed at the retreating crimson light, as though calculating something, and replied, "If it is not a Golden Core Realm mount, then it must be some ancient demon or a great demon king summoned by Yue Cultivating Sect. Since it is of the Dry Fire system, it is likely a type of legendary Luan bird, owing a favor to Yue Cultivating Sect and flying south from the north using its divine abilities."
Li Xuanxuan shook his sleeves and used his mana to dispel the moisture clinging to his cuffs. Faintly, he heard the cheers of the townsfolk below. To them, seeing the rain clouds dissipate after so many years of relentless downpour made them believe the rain had finally ended. However, he smiled bitterly and said, "I am afraid this is not good news at all!"
He scooped up a handful of soil from the mountain. The earth felt warm to the touch. He murmured to himself, "If this persists for more than three days, it will not just stop the crops from growing! Even the forest trees will wither and dry up completely."
Liu Changdie glanced at the elderly man and said softly, "It is an unavoidable situation… A confrontation between two sects—this is a once-in-a-century occurrence."
He sighed as he descended the mountain, still mulling over the matter, "Dry Fire can suppress dampness, stop the rain, and turn cold into heat, but how does one deal with the cries of millions of suffering souls? Compared to the Azure Pond Sect, Yue Cultivating Sect's methods seem too feeble."
Li Family, Central Hall
The glazed tiles of the hall's roof reflected a bright crimson glow. The white ape was prostrated on the ground, bowing towards the distant feathered beast as though in reverence. Beside it stood a boy, dressed in white-gold robes that shimmered under the vivid light.
The boy stared intently at the retreating feathered beast, as though deeply moved. At his feet, a few thin cicadas that had flown down wriggled and crawled. Some flipped onto their backs, struggling and spinning in the water, while others climbed up the boy's pant.
Li Zhouwei seemed entirely unaware of their presence. The white ape soon stood up, picked up a few of the cicadas from the ground, and stuffed them into its mouth. Li Zhouwei spoke in his childish voice, "What a huge bird."
As he gazed downward, a figure ascended the steps. Dressed in ornate robes and followed by several attendants, the woman waved the others away before walking in slowly. Her expression was complicated as she looked at the child.
Li Zhouwei nodded slightly at her and bowed ever so slightly, saying, "Mother."
This was none other than Madam Hu, the wife of Li Chengliao. She had carried Li Zhouwei in her womb for eleven months, enduring no small amount of torment during his birth. Even now, when facing those dark golden eyes of his, a faint fear lingered in her heart.
This child had never shown her any affection and had almost cost her her life during childbirth. Yet, her maternal instincts allowed her to suppress these fears. Speaking gently, she asked about his well-being. After Li Zhouwei answered her questions, she said, "In a few days, your father will select a weapon for you. Have you thought about what you would like?"
Li Zhouwei tilted his head slightly and replied in a quiet voice, "I have no particular preference. Whatever Father teaches, I will practice."
