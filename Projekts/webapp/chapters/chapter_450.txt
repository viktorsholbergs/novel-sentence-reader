Yang Xiao'er smiled as she stepped closer and quietly replied, "My family's ancestor also praised him, saying he was a heroic, kind, and amiable man... It took him only thirty years to establish his foundation, and all four of his sons are remarkable talents..."
Yang Xiao'er spoke with unmistakable respect, perhaps influenced by her affection for Li Xizhi which in turn fostered her positive impression on the elders of the Li Family.
Li Xizhi, however, was surprised as he listened.
How is this possible? I-It's... been nearly a hundred years… My great ancestor was merely a mortal! How could Yang Tianya possibly remember him…? What is the meaning of this?!
Li Xizhi had read the Internal History before and knew all the truths.
Although it was not surprising for her to say that great grandfather was talented... What did she mean by kind and amiable? It would be a better compliment to say that he was cunning and bold! Not many in my family are kind and amiable... Yang Tianya... This Yang Tianya!
As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Li Xizhi could only laugh and say, "He was not as accomplished as Old Ancestor Tianya who… after his recent breakthrough, must be nearing the peak of Foundation Establishment, with the Purple Mansion Realm soon within reach!"
"It won't be that easy," Yang Xiao'er simply muttered, her gaze drifting toward the distant sky as she added softly, "The Lixia Immortals are coming."
Li Xizhi followed her gaze and spotted a large gray boat in the air. A middle-aged man who was clad in snow-white fox fur with slightly elongated eyes stood calmly at the bow against the breeze.
"Man on Mount Feather, Xiao Yongling!"
Xiao Yongling carried an unassuming aura and did not appear particularly exceptional, yet he commanded respect and admiration. After all, he had fought three Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators alone in Yuyuan Market, preserving the most prosperous hub for the Xiao Family and earning himself a formidable reputation throughout Yue State.
This battle had left Xiao Yongling gravely injured, but thanks to the Xiao Family's treasured panaceas, not only was he saved, but his strength also greatly increased.
Now standing at the bow of the boat, he offered a light nod and smile to Li Xizhi, who hurriedly returned the gesture while Yang Xiao'er cupped her fist respectfully.
She mused, Rumor has it that Man on Mount Feather and Celestial Moon Sword knew each other for a long time and were close… So it must be true then!
After a brief wait, cultivators from the three sects and seven gates arrived. As Daoist Master Yuan Su and Daoist Master Qiushui stepped out of thin air, colorful lights of their divine abilities began to rise. Above Mount Dongli, a gap soon appeared in the sky, revealing collapsed pavilions and mountain peaks.
The disciples moved in an orderly procession through the gap, disappearing swiftly into the skies. From Mount Dongli, rich spiritual qi poured forth and spiritual energy surged powerfully. Streams of spiritual qi descended from the void, causing the spirit water to churn and the spirit flames to flare. This disturbance roused the rogue and devil cultivators, who had been lying in wait on the mountain, into action.
An hour later, the air was filled with dust, debris, and fragments of pavilions raining down as the rogue cultivators erupted into cheers.
"The Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven has fallen into the sea!"
Meanwhile on Mount Qingdu…
Li Yuanjiao emerged, riding the wind as Moongaze Lake celebrated his breakthrough with rainfall. He navigated through the mist, shrouding the lake in mist. He glided through it, feeling free and unrestrained.
As a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Li Yuanjiao enjoyed a noble status. Such a breakthrough would leave anyone beaming with joy, and he had not felt this proud in many years. Soaring above the Fei Family's territory, he gazed at the bright stars, having left Yue State and arrived in Xu State.
This area, governed by the Yue Cultivating Sect, was considered very safe. Beyond it lay the wild hills—a far more perilous route avoided by most cultivators. Given the dangers near Mount Dongli, Li Yuanjiao preferred to take a longer detour.
The night deepened, yet he did not dim his mana light. He was secretly hoping to encounter some devil or rogue cultivators to rob, thereby replenishing his dwindling storage pouch.
In such a wilderness and armed with the mirror, Li Yuanjiao was naturally eager for such encounters.
Unfortunately, the cultivators in the mountains were mostly of the Qi Cultivation and Embryonic Breathing Realms—who were wise enough not to provoke a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. After an uneventful flight that lasted several days, Li Yuanjiao finally arrived at the territory of Profound Peak Gate.
The mountain gate of Profound Peak loomed like a giant bear hibernating in the morning sun, intimidating yet awe-inspiring. Reflecting on Daoist Master Changxi's achievements of moving the mountain all the way from Xu State, Li Yuanjiao felt a flicker of yearning for the Purple Mansion Realm.
How many more years must my family wait before we produce someone of such caliber…?
As he prepared to ride the wind around the mountain, a female cultivator dressed in a light-yellow dharma robe soared into the sky and halted him in his flight. She cupped her fist respectfully and asked softly, "Kong Tingyun from Profound Peak greets fellow Daoist… May I ask which peak you represent?"
Her discerning eyes immediately recognized the extraordinary nature of the Qingche Sword behind Li Yuanjiao. Coupled with his Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit, he appeared rather majestic amidst the clouds and fog, leading her to assume he was a cultivator of high standing from one of the three sects and seven gates.
Li Yuanjiao returned the gesture, responding in a deep voice.
"I am Li Yuanjiao of the Li Family from Lijing… Pleased to meet you, fellow Daoist!"
"Ah, the Sword Immortal Clan," Kong Tingyun noted with admiration, then added softly, "What brings you to our territory? I'd be happy to assist in any way I can."
Knowing it was imprudent to reveal his true intentions, Li Yuanjiao simply stated, "I seek passage to the estuary of the Great River... I wonder if Profound Peak could facilitate this...?"
Upon hearing his request, Kong Tingyun chuckled softly. Her eyes glinted as she responded, "If Brother Jiao has come here seeking the treasures of Dongli, I'm afraid you'd be disappointed!"
"Hmm?"
Li Yuanjiao maintained his composure though his motives were quickly discerned by this woman, and simply smiled.
"Why do you say that?" he asked.
Kong Tingyun explained, "Brother Jiao is smart enough to think of navigating the Profound Peak's territories to reach the sea, but each family's land here is well-fortified. Wherever rogue cultivators descended, they fall under the jurisdiction of that sect."
"Not just in Profound Peak, but also among the Sword Sect, Red Reef, and Snow Ji. All Dao lineages are united and have set up ambushes. No rogue cultivator would be able to slip through," she added.
She continued gently, emphasizing, "The Dongli Sect has left behind many valuables, including dharma relics and the Dao lineage of Daoist Master Cui Mu of Dongli. Even if they decay, they will do so within the confines of Yue State—it's absolutely impossible for them to reach the eastern sea. Two groups have already come seeking these treasures, and both were turned away by Profound Peak..."
Upon hearing this, Li Yuanjiao chuckled self-deprecatingly and shrugged as he replied, "It seems the world is full of clever people… small schemes are indeed laughable."
Observing his unruffled demeanor, Kong Tingyun's regard for him grew. She smiled faintly and offered a word of advice.
"This matter is highly confidential. While I can't divulge too much, Brother Jiao should know that the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven is under close watch…
"Don't be fooled by the joy of the rogue and devil cultivators. Anything they touch, anyone they meet, and all traces they leave within three days of departing Dongli are monitored. The ordinary items will be overlooked, but nothing of the Purple Mansion Realm will be able to slip through..."
Li Yuanjiao felt a chill down his spine as he nodded slowly. Kong Tingyun, mistaking his reaction for prior knowledge, exclaimed, "Forgive me for flaunting my knowledge, I have forgotten about the close ties between the Xiao and Li families!"
Li Yuanjiao reassured her repeatedly, and Kong Tingyun, looking at his Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, hesitated briefly before saying, "Actually, there is a small matter for which I might require Brother Jiao's assistance..."
"What is it?" Li Yuanjiao asked.
Kong Tingyun explained, "I was guarding one of the estuaries a few years ago and once encountered a Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creature in Lake Xian that is linked to the sea… Unfortunately, I wasn't strong enough to vanquish it alone. I am the only Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator on Yunyue Peak so… could I hire Brother Jiao to assist me?"
