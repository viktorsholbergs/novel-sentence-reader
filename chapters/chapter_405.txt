Azure Pond Sect.
Azure Pond Peak was enveloped in swirling clouds and mist. Within the cave dwelling on the mountain, a dark golden bell with intricate patterns hung in the center. It was only rung upon the death of a Daoist Master or the ascension of a sect master.
Chi Zhiyun landed on the peak hurriedly, followed by a group of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. As soon as he landed, a tall young man approached, cupping his fist in greeting.
"Sect Master!"
"Hejing."
Chi Zhiyun waved his hand urgently, not stopping, and stepped into the stone cave, asking, "How is it?"
"The flame is dim and turned bright white… The lamp oil is rising, the nine lines are flickering. This has never happened before." Ning Hejing's voice was grave.
Chi Zhiyun's expression grew increasingly grim as he muttered, "Bright white…? How could that be?!"
He dismissed the others and quickly stepped deeper into the cave dwelling. Several soul lamps rested on lotus seats carved from wood, burning quietly.
The wood sculpture was made from Soul-Tuning Mulberry Wood, which could foretell blessings and disasters, was impervious to the five elements, and feared only thunder. The lamp oil used Nine Refined Soul Essence, once a precious treasure was now no longer particularly valued.
Chi Zhiyun focused his gaze, and indeed, Daoist Master Buzi's flame was noticeably smaller. It has changed from a pale gray to bright white, with the patterns on the lamp base interweaving between dark and light.
Only Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing were in the cave, both looking grim. Ning Hejing spoke in a low voice, "I have already inquired; the Daoist Master left the sect earlier without leaving any message."
Chi Buzi was Chi Zhiyun's great-grandfather, and Chi Zhiyun's lineage was the maternal family of Ning Hejing's branch. The two grew up together, their interests closely intertwined, making them almost like real brothers.
As soon as Chi Zhiyun became sect master, Ning Hejing was appointed as the peak master of Yuanxing Peak, gaining significant influence within the sect. Now that there was an issue with Chi Buzi, he was naturally worried.
"Do Daoist Masters Yuanwu and Yuan Xiu know of this?" Chi Zhiyun blurted out suddenly.
Ning Hejing shook his head and replied, "Rest assured, Clan Brother. I have sealed off this information immediately. The two disciples guarding the lamps are trusted members and will not leak this news. As of now, only Daoist Master Yuan Su is aware."
"Good." Chi Zhiyun praised him and speculated in a low voice, "Now that devil cultivators are running rampant, without the Man On Creek, they cannot be contained. Xiao Chuting is trapped in the Eastern Sea, and the Daoist Master must have gone to find him."
Chi Zhiyun tapped the edge of the table anxiously and muttered, "Could it be Zhang Tianyuan? What is his Golden Feather Sect thinking? Do they not fear ruining things?!"
"That is not necessarily so!"
A clear voice echoed through the cave.
Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing both relaxed, respectfully stepping aside as they greeted the newcomer.
"Welcome, Daoist Master."
Daoist Master Yuan Su, dressed in green, his robe looser with a small white seal at his waist and a slightly rounded face, spoke softly, "Zhang Qiushui of Golden Feather Sect has mastered the Moistening Radiant Lead life divine ability, which can also attract these devil cultivators... just not as effectively as Man On Creek or Heavy Murk. The matter of the True Monarch is crucial; it will not be entirely entrusted to the three of us."
Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing both bowed their heads respectfully. Daoist Master Yuan Su continued, "However, without at least five or six Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, it is impossible to detain Buzi. Zhang Tianyuan cannot orchestrate such a formation; at most, he would cause Buzi some trouble."
Daoist Master Yuan Su appeared unconcerned, smiling as he continued, "Buzi is just like my senior brother was in life, now having reached the mid-stage of the Purple Mansion Realm. Over the decades, he has become arrogant and conceited, yet also inherently greedy... Though he is calculating, it is rare for him to suffer setbacks. It will not be a problem!"
Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing, not daring to interrupt, shrank back like quails. After a moment, they finally suggested, "Daoist Master, maybe you should deduce it…"
They only dared to ask due to Daoist Master Yuan Su's mild temperament. Daoist Master Yuan Su merely shrugged and replied, "He is cautious, leaving no traces in the Great Void, and his cultivation is high. I possess the divine abilities of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, not the fate-determining power of a Maha… what could I use to deduce?"
He shook his head and joked, "If he is dead and his divine abilities dissipate, I might be able to deduce something."
Chi Zhiyun and Ning Hejing exchanged glances, clearly not amused. Daoist Master Yuan Su shrugged, reached out to trace the air in front of him, and stepped into the Great Void, his voice still echoing in their ears.
"He most likely got caught up in something while rescuing Xiao Chuting in the Eastern Sea. I will go check it out."
Lu Jiangxian's divine sense was even more formidable than expected, forcefully entering Chi Buzi's sea of consciousness, and disorienting his soul. Chi Buzi, being from an immortal sect with considerable experience, quickly realized he was facing a highly skilled cultivator.
Activating a secret technique, he gathered his spiritual sense and called out, "I am a disciple under the Pristine Water Origin Talisman True Monarch… I do not know which senior is before me, but if I have offended you, please forgive me!"
Despite being several hundred years old and seasoned, Chi Buzi was not intimidated by Lu Jiangxian's overwhelming presence. He observed closely and discerned that Lu Jiangxian was all bluster. If it were not for his high intrinsic rank, Chi Buzi would not have felt threatened.
He spoke politely while thinking to himself, This old man appears to be an ancient cultivator who has fallen on hard times… if I could kill him, the rewards would definitely elevate me to greatness!
Lu Jiangxian, however, remained silent, his divine sense ruthlessly overwhelming Chi Buzi. Although Chi Buzi's spiritual sense was not as strong, he had a large quantity of it, and he resisted stubbornly, continuing to shout out, "May I know which metallic essence the senior cultivate?"
No matter how Chi Buzi inquired, Lu Jiangxian did not respond, relentlessly pursuing him. Chi Buzi had not anticipated that Lu Jiangxian's divine sense would be so unyielding, causing him to retreat repeatedly.
After about an incense stick's time, Chi Buzi began to grow anxious.
"Senior, be cautious… I am known to the True Monarch, and if something happens to me, it will surely alarm him!"
Ignoring him, Lu Jiangxian continued his aggressive assault, finally grabbing him tightly as he sighed with relief, If this were within the world of the mirror, eliminating him would be a matter of a single thought… but here in his Shenyang Mansion, it took so much effort!
Seeing Chi Buzi still struggling, Lu Jiangxian made up his mind. Using the backlash from the Yin Quarters Nine Hills Heart Questioning Spell, he began to read Chi Buzi's memories.
