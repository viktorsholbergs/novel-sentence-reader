Elder Ao swept his eyes over everyone, and the new disciple seemed to finally calm down.
"Elder Ao." The vagabond cultivators bowed their heads and saluted, sensing his gaze.
“The sect has paid a great cost to operate this flying ship for you all in hope that everyone can rest assured of our identities," Elder Ao said in a solemn tone.
"Regardless of the size of any sect, it goes without saying that each person should contribute. So, I hope everyone won't waste their time and will adhere to the rules of the sect."
"We will abide by the teachings of Elder Ao," they replied.
They had all felt the need to shift their attitude. The methods of killing and pillaging might work outside, but within the sect, it wouldn't be tolerated.
Chen Xun also had a realization. The sect wasn’t a place to idle away and spend your days, it was an abode for cultivation. Since the sect provided this opportunity, they were also expected to contribute back. Everyone present understood this, as they had all climbed their way up from wandering cultivators. They were no fools.
Elder Ao surveyed the group and nodded slightly. These vagabonds might not have been the most talented, but they were the main force in the Southern Dipper Mountain Secret Realm that is opened every twenty years. They were willing to take risks and had various means at their disposal. The sects specifically recruited such individuals to pave the way for more talented disciples.
"Very well," Elder Ao said expressionlessly. He stopped speaking, turned, and sat cross-legged at the front of the flying ship.
The other Five Elements Sect disciples also sat behind him and started cultivating.
"Excuse me, friend." A handsome skinny man approached Chen Xun. He was at the eighth level of Qi Refinement.
He and the black ox were sitting at the rear of the ship. When he saw his future fellow disciple approaching he flashed him a friendly smile and nodded.
"My name is Ji Kun. We'll be fellow disciples from now on. I've come to pay a visit, and I hope you won't mind."
Ji Kun gestured politely, and he had a quick look around. The other cultivators either had high cultivation levels or were outsiders, but this one looked more approachable.
"I'm Chen Xun. It's a pleasure to meet you, Senior Brother Ji. Please, have a seat."
Chen Xun patted the spot in front of him, acting very casual. He then looked at the black ox.
"This is my ancestral Great Black Ox, it’s at the second level of Qi Refinement."
"Moo~" The big black ox stood up, stretched its body, and gave a greeting call to Ji Kun.
"It's a spiritual beast! Hello, Junior Brother Ox," Ji Kun said, sitting down with a smile.
He didn’t know how the sect treated spirit beasts, so he decided to casually address the big black ox as "Junior Brother Ox."
But hearing Chen Xun call him "Senior Brother Ji," he inexplicably felt a sense of satisfaction. It was really nice to be part of an organization after his years as a vagabond.
"Moo~" The big black ox seemed pleased he addressed it in such a manner and let out another soft moo.
"_Hehe_. You don't have to be so formal, Senior Brother Ji. Do you have any information about the sect?. I'm completely unfamiliar with the Five Elements Sect."
Chen Xun looked at Ji Kun with great interest. Clearly, this guy had some connections within the sect.
" Junior Brother Chen, you think too highly of me. I just asked some Five Elements Sect disciples, and they were kind enough to tell me a few things. It's nothing worth mentioning." Ji Kun shook his head, wearing a faint smile. He then continued: "But since you're my junior brother, I'll tell you a little secret. The Five Elements Sect is broad with many factions."
"I heard they have around five thousand members, is that true?" Chen Xun asked in confusion.
He had been to many places, but he had never heard of any sect with such numbers.
Ji Kun shook his head and extended his arm, spreading his palm out and gesturing a five.
"Fifty thousand?!" Chen Xun was shocked, and the black ox's eyes rolled back and it proverbially fainted in disbelief. So many cultivators! They had lived for so many years and the number of cultivators they had seen didn’t even come close! Not all!
"Hehe..." Ji Kun watched Chen Xun's reaction with great satisfaction.
He took a deep breath and said slowly, "It's actually even more than that." Hearing this, Chen Xun's eyes rolled back as he fainted as well.
" Junior Brother Chen!!"
"Moo~~!!"
It didn't take long for Chen Xun to recover.
His heart surged with shock as he exclaimed, "Senior Brother Ji! More than fifty thousand?!"
"That's correct." Ji Kun confirmed.
"So, the Ten Great Sects of Qian Nation are not the strongest?" Chen Xun asked.
"It’s not “The Ten Great Sects of Qian Nation.” There are many other sects from different countries than the Qian Nation." Ji Kun corrected, similarly amazed at his own words.
It could be said that all of Qian Nation's outstanding cultivators were part of the Ten Great Sects, making it an incredibly exciting place.
"Old ox, did you hear what Senior Brother Ji said? Now this is really what “broadening our horizons” means." Chen Xun said, spreading one hand and speaking with enthusiasm.
The big black ox was still dazed, and it kept nodding its head. It had always thought that the Nine Star Valley was the peak of the cultivation world.
"However, for outer sect disciples like us without a background, joining the outer circle’s Hall of Servants is our best bet," Ji Kun said in a deep voice. "Although you'll have to take dangerous missions, your contributions will be substantial, and you can earn a lot of treasures, as well as gain combat experience to quickly advance your cultivation."
Chen Xun understood. Ji Kun had said so much because he was trying to recruit him. He was trying to form a group with them.
"All right, Senior Brother Ji, I'll consider your suggestion seriously. If I decide to join the Hall of Servants, you'll be the first one I look for," Chen Xun said, bowing with sincerity.
"Very well. Junior Brother Chen , Junior Brother Ox , I won't disturb you any longer," Ji Kun replied with a smile before leaving to find other acquaintances.
"Moo~" The big black ox called out to Ji Kun's departing figure.
Chen Xun didn’t act rashly and make any decisions based solely on Ji Kun's words. Joining the Hall of Servants didn't align with his goals nor his principles. He didn't want to engage in battles within the sect; he had finally found a place with order where he could live in peace.
However, everything would have to wait until they arrived at the Five Elements Sect.
**_Buzz..._**
The flying ship continued to sail in the air, and the hearts of all the cultivators on board grew increasingly restless.
...
Zhiyang Province was located on the northern border of the Qian Nation. It was mainly characterized by vast plains and rivers, its abundant wildlife, and a population known for its valiant and chivalrous spirit.
However, within Zhiyang Province lay several vast and mysterious mountain ranges. One of them was the Yuzhu Mountain Range in the western regions of the province. It came in second in terms of size within the province.
The Yuzhu Mountain Range was shrouded in mist, and countless locals who ventured inside would often get lost only to return claiming they had witnessed a divine presence.
That’s why, despite its immense size, the mountain range was rarely visited by humans. Countless folk legends and official proclamations teached the people not to tread inside.
The Yuzhu Mountain Range featured winding, rugged mountain peaks; steep cliffs shrouded in mist; towering ancient trees, and meandering rivers, which added layers of mystery to the already enchanting landscape.
What none of the province's residents knew was that this range was the hidden residence of one of the major sects in the land—the Five Elements Sect.
The fantastical formations continuously refined and strengthened by generations of sect elders had long hidden this place from the eyes of the mortal world.
Within these formations were buildings, towers, and pavilions constructed throughout the mountain range, with majestic temples perched atop various peaks, overlooking the entire Yuzhu Mountain Range.
Amidst the towering mountains and rugged landscapes, countless caves and grottoes dotted the area. Occasionally, flashes of divine light emanated from within. Furthermore, the spiritual energy inside was abundant to the point that it almost turned tangible. Who would have thought that this seemingly mysterious and remote place was the residence of the Five Elements Sect, one of the most significant cultivation sects in the region?
Inside the extraordinary arrays driven by unified formations were the Five Elements Sect disciples flying through the sky. They appeared tense, as if racing against the clock with their limited lifespans.
Above the celestial dome, several flying boats passed by. After a month's journey, Chen Xun and the others had finally arrived.
