When Li Tongya finally regained consciousness, the world was a dusky yellow. He had fallen by a small river on Mount Bianyan, half of his body submerged in the water. Several blue river crabs scuttled around his feet, lingering due to the influence of his Boundless Ocean immortal foundation.
Cough, cough…
Li Tongya slowly stood up. Orange-red clouds floated in the sky, and the colorful lights and the golden figure on Mount Bianyan had disappeared. Only a few carrion crows stood on the ruins, cawing mournfully.
"It is over…"
Resentment, guilt, and helplessness surged within him. Barefoot, Li Tongya stepped by the riverbank, staring blankly at the clouds on the horizon, gradually closing his eyes.
The water membrane on his abdomen slowly dissipated, and his flesh wriggled to cover the gaping wound, making it look less horrific.
Only Li Tongya knew that none of his internal organs were intact. He was barely clinging to life with his immortal foundation. From now on, he feared he could no longer progress in cultivation, and even maintaining his current cultivation level would prove to be a challenge.
Immortal cultivation differed from Buddhism cultivation. Buddhist cultivators believed the body was a vessel of suffering, and once they achieved the realm of Master Monk, their internal organs turned to white clay. In higher realms, they could freely change their bodies.
In contrast, immortal cultivators seek personal transcendence. At least until they attained the metallic essence, the body was fundamental to their cultivation. Yu Yufeng's progress stalled after being struck by a single sword from Yu Yuxie, even though his internal organs weren't damaged like Li Tongya.
The pain surging in Li Tongya's heart had not yet subsided when he felt a weight at his waist. He belatedly untied the long robe from his waist, and a round head rolled out.
"Ling'er…"
Li Xuanling's nose had been broken, likely during the battle in the temple. It looked crooked on his serene face. Li Tongya reached out to straighten it, but it flopped back down. He tried again and again, blood oozing from the fractured face, dripping downward.
"Ling'er!"
Li Tongya did not cry when he saw Li Xuanling die before him, nor when tortured and cursed by the Maha. But now, the broken nose of his eldest son easily made this old man, who had borne family and clan grudges for sixty years, wail in sorrow. A stream of tears rolled down his cheeks, falling into the lifeless eyes of Li Xuanling.
"It is my fault… I failed you and your mother…" Li Tongya cried as he managed to choke out these few words. The old man trembled, filled with shame and helplessness, and cried out in a mix of self-justification and despair, "Our family… Our family rose from humble farmers, born into this chaotic world of great strife, killing demons and exorcising evil, navigating through power struggles… Your father never had a moment of peace, never relaxed for a second… Your father did his best, Ling'er… Your father did his best!"
His originally white inner robe was now covered in mud and water, turning gray and yellow. Holding Li Xuanling's head, he alternated between murmuring to himself and crying out loud. With the brilliant sunset behind him, he staggered forward, one step at a time.
"The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and the Maha's hundred-year plan… It is beyond the power of one family, one generation… Human effort has its limits!"
Li Tongya, dressed in his thin white robe with his hair disheveled and his gray eyes full of tears, shone brilliantly in the reflection of the setting sun.
"Xuanling… Xuanling… One day—" Li Tongya's lips trembled as he spoke. Gradually, he moved deeper into the dark forest. The pitch-black shadows of the trees slowly covered his robe. As his figure was swallowed by the darkness, his voice faded into the sounds of chirping insects and birds.
Lijing Town.
"Congratulations! Congratulations to the family head!" a middle-aged cultivator praised.
Li Yuanping sat at the seat of honor, all dressed in white, his face pale. He was continually sketching with a brush on the desk, not even glancing at the person below him. He replied with a tone of indifference, "What is there to be happy about?"
Li Tongya had been missing for several days. The scouts sent to gather information only reported that there had been earthquakes and roars of a giant golden figure in the southern part of Xu State. Beyond that, nothing else could be found. Li Yuanping, coordinating with various parties, was worried about this matter and had not slept for several days.
The middle-aged cultivator below, with a fawning smile, repeatedly cupped his fist and replied, "I am a rogue cultivator under the rule of the Golden Tang Gate. A few days ago, I crossed south to this lake and unexpectedly encountered the renowned Li Family of Lijing. I hurried to offer my congratulations."
With a thud, he kneeled down and presented a wooden box with both hands, saying respectfully, "This is a gift—Cloud Floral Fruit, a specialty of Xu State. It is a spirit fruit of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, gentle in its medicinal properties, able to stabilize cultivation and enhance mana…"
The Li Family, now a prestigious clan, often received visits from rogue cultivators who might offer medicinal recipes, spirit herbs, or artifacts, all in hopes of finding a place to stay.
Li Yuanping had seen many of these. Seeing that the man was still holding back information, he said warmly, "Put the gift aside for now. Please share the good news… If the information is valuable, we will not be stingy."
The cultivator nodded repeatedly, responding respectfully, "Your esteemed ancestor slew the Maha Reincarnate, Fahui of Duanchen Temple, at Zhenhui Temple. The green and white sword light was earth-shattering, shaking Xu State. Now, the three sects and seven gates all speak of his name, calling him the Celestial Moon Sword!"
"What?!"
Li Yuanping was stunned, his face flushing with excitement. He quickly dropped his brush and hurried down in two steps, his face full of joy and disbelief. Grabbing the cultivator's hand, he asked urgently, "Which ancestor? Which ancestor?!"
Seeing Li Yuanping's huge reaction, the cultivator also looked pleased. Not daring to mention Li Tongya's name directly, he replied respectfully, "The ancestor from the Tong generation, named Ya, skilled in swordsmanship, and rides a serpent dragon…"
"It is him!"
The cultivator was unaware of the Li Family's generational names and just assumed Li Tongya was of the Tong generation. But Li Yuanping understood him immediately, his face flushing with joy. He looked up and laughed heartily, his excitement causing him to cough. He had to lower his head and laugh quietly.
"Hahaha!"
Dou Yi, sensing the change in atmosphere, stepped forward cheerfully and asked, "Young Master, should we go to Mount Wutu to report this news?"
Hearing this, Li Yuanping coughed twice and suddenly straightened up, startling the two people beside him into lowering their heads quickly. He looked at the cultivator and smiled, "Where did you get this information?"
The cultivator quickly cupped his fist and began to speak in a rambling manner.
It turned out that this person was a humble servant in the market under the Golden Tang Gate. Overhearing a conversation between two disciples of the Golden Tang Gate and hearing that the Li Family was inquiring about the matter of Mount Bianyan, he immediately sensed an opportunity.
He decisively abandoned his job in the market, sold everything he owned to buy the spirit fruit, and rushed overnight to Moongaze Lake to try his luck. Upon arriving at Moongaze Lake, he indeed found that the Li Family was still unaware of this news, so he loudly came forward to report it.
"It does seem somewhat credible…" Li Yuanping mumbled as he listened carefully and nodded secretly. He patted the man's shoulder kindly and said, "Thank you, Fellow Daoist. Please wait a moment while I verify the authenticity of this news. There will be a generous reward if it proves true."
The cultivator repeatedly nodded and thanked him, then hurriedly left. Only then did Li Yuanping beckon Dou Yi to come closer and whispered, "Please ask Brother Jiao to return."
