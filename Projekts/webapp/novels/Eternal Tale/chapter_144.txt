West City, the base of the Five Elements Sect, inside the pavilion.
Liu Yuan's face was slightly pale, injured during the duel; that woman had shown no mercy.
"Master, this time the Tianwu Sect has come with ill intentions." A young maiden looked at Liu Yuan with concern. "They might ambush us on the way."
Liu Yuan's expression was solemn, but there was no panic on her face. "What do the Top Ten Sects say?"
"Reporting to the Peak Master, the Immortal Sects said..."
"Speak." Liu Yuan's gaze sharpened, her aura intensifying.
The male disciple, frightened, trembled and quickly said, "They will not interfere in the grudges between our sects."
"Then we stay in West City and wait for reinforcements from our sect." Liu Yuan was decisive, giving no room for hesitation. "For now, we will train in West City."
"Master..."
"Peak Master..."
The surrounding disciples were stunned, a bit flustered, most of them having only contributions without substantial wealth.
Liu Yuan took in their expressions but prioritized their safety, unwilling to see the younger generation perish needlessly.
The disciples exchanged glances; the Peak Master always stayed in the city the longest.
Other peak masters of the sect either didn't come or had left early with their disciples, leaving no room for targeted attacks. They felt both helpless and pained, having no choice but to follow the orders.
"Junior Sister Liu!"
A bold voice came from outside. A man with silver hair, dressed in white robes, with eyes shining brightly and an aura of a celestial being, appeared.
It was Ji Haoxuan, the Peak Master of the Artifact Refining Hall, a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator.
"Senior Brother Ji." Liu Yuan stood up, joy in her eyes; she remembered he had left before the duel.
"I heard that the Tianwu Sect was causing trouble for our Five Elements Sect?!" Ji Haoxuan stepped in, waving his sleeve and standing with hands behind his back, his temper seeming fiery. "I rushed back immediately with my men. Who dares to bully my Junior Sister Liu!"
"Greetings, Peak Master Ji!"
"Greetings, Peak Master Ji!"
Everyone inside the pavilion was overjoyed, bowing their heads with respect, feeling deeply moved.
"Senior Brother Ji, there may be an ambush outside the city." Liu Yuan remained very calm. "This time, the Tianwu Sect came prepared, and there were many spies near our base."
"I'm well aware." Ji Haoxuan snorted coldly. "I have already sent disciples to intercept on another route, no need to return the same way. If we don't return to the sect, how will we train in West City? Spread the word; do they really think our Five Elements Sect is afraid of their Tianwu Sect!"
Upon hearing this, the disciples were deeply moved. Peak Master Ji's words resonated with them.
Liu Yuan felt much more at ease seeing Ji Haoxuan. "I'll leave the arrangements to you, Senior Brother."
"Rest assured, Junior Sister Liu. Once back at the sect, we will demand an explanation from the Tianwu Sect!"
"Peak Master Ji is mighty!"
"Peak Master Ji is mighty!"
The disciples couldn't help but cheer, the sense of security intoxicating.
"All of you, go back and train properly." Ji Haoxuan frowned, scolding them, "Remember today's humiliation. Are you still in the mood to cheer here? Do you have no shame?!"
The pavilion fell silent instantly, words caught in their throats, everyone lowering their heads.
"Senior Brother Ji, please." Liu Yuan also glared at the disciples, particularly glancing twice at the blushing, flustered young female disciple, feeling as if she saw herself being scolded by her master back then.
"Junior Sister Liu?" Ji Haoxuan called out a few times in confusion, wondering why Liu Yuan suddenly lost focus.
"Let's go, Senior Brother Ji." Liu Yuan snapped back to reality, and the two walked out.
They still needed to prepare; the road back to the sect would not be peaceful, and they might even have to fight.
â€¦
Seven days later, the centennial event concluded. Outside the city, the sky echoed with thunderous roars. Giant ships set sail, adorned with sect flags.
Flying spirit beasts soared across the sky, their overwhelming presence casting large shadows on the ground.
West City, the base of the Five Elements Sect. A command was issued: Depart, do not engage with anyone.
At the docking area outside the city, two giant ships of the Five Elements Sect ascended into the sky. A sect flag was raised, stirring up immense clouds of dust.
The disciples standing on the ships, holding magical artifacts, looked around nervously.
Liu Yuan and Ji Haoxuan stood at the forefront. The defensive formations were already set up, the route back to the sect had been adjusted, and they had begun to meditate to maintain their peak state.
The Five Elements Sect was too far from Yuxu City to send a message in time. Even if reinforcements came, they might encounter ambushes from the Tianwu Sect on the way.
The enemy was hidden while they were exposed, leaving them in a very unfortunate position. They could only aim to minimize their losses.
West City, base of the Tianwu Sect. A command echoed through the area: Act, kill without mercy.
Within the city, Tianwu Sect disciples assembled. Outside the city, the Tianwu Sect's giant ships took off, producing a loud hum, heading in the direction of the Five Elements Sect's ships.
Meanwhile, East City, outside a secluded talisman shop.
Fallen leaves scattered, presenting a desolate scene.
The big black ox stood outside the shop, its eyes sharp, looking at the gray-robed man in front. He quietly closed the door, his gaze calm, and then they left together.
The man and ox walked slowly down this secluded street. The number of passersby had significantly decreased, and the conversations were no longer lively.
The sky above Yuxu City was somewhat dim today, shrouded in a gray mist.
Dark clouds pressed against the sky, heavy as if they were about to fall, creating a stifling atmosphere that made the world seem eerily silent.
"Old Ox, it has gotten much colder."
"Moo~"
"After living for so many years, we have made quite a few friends."
"Moo~"
The black ox snorted heavily, looking ahead with determination, exuding a strong aura.
"But among our living friends, it seems only Junior Sister Liu Yuan is left." Chen Xun's eyes flashed with a cold light, then returned to calm. "If we let her fall into danger, Shi Jing would never forgive us."
"Moo~~!"
The big black ox's breathing grew heavier, and the powerful aura it emitted became more pronounced.
Passing Qi Refining cultivators suddenly had their pupils contract sharply, their raised footsteps pausing in mid-air.
Chen Xun and the big black ox continued walking calmly.
"After cultivating for hundreds of years, I've had enough regrets. It's time to escort Junior Sister Liu Yuan." Chen Xun stopped, looking ahead. He slowly put on a straw hat. "Right, Old Ox?"
"Moo~~!!"
The big black ox stood up, and a whirlwind arose around it, spreading out with a roar.
The spiritual energy on the street suddenly stagnated, and the passing cultivators froze, bringing a terrifying, hair-raising chill to their souls. Their lips trembled, unable to speak for a long time, as if their thoughts had slowed down.
_Silence._
_A deathly silence._
The entire street fell into an eerie stillness, as if time had stopped.
Suddenly, the cultivators were startled, taking short, spasmodic breaths, rooted to the spot.
Instantly, their faces were filled with terror and shock!
What was happening?!!
This... What kind of terrifying pressure was this...
The cultivators on the street tried to mobilize their spiritual energy, but it was all in vain; they were stuck, unable to operate it, now as helpless as ordinary people.
"Old Ox, let's go."
"Moo~"
With that, Chen Xun pressed down on his straw hat. In an instant, immense spiritual energy surged, and the two figures disappeared in a blink.
**Boom...**
**Boom...**
Just after they left, a boundless whirlwind swept through the street, the spiritual energy in chaos, like a violent release after extreme suppression.
The cultivators on this secluded street were dumbfounded, gasping for fresh air, their eyes still filled with intense fear.
That suffocating feeling of death would be unforgettable for them, lingering in their minds even as they approached their own end.
