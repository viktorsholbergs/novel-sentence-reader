The Next Day, the entire Great Li Realm world was shaken to its core. The fall of a Nascent Soul cultivator in the Forbidden Sea sent shockwaves through the heavens and earth—an ancient cultivation family, the Yu clan, had lost one of their own!
Cultivators across the 360 prefectures were stunned, their minds filled with disbelief. How could a Nascent Soul cultivator possibly perish?
Even the hidden ancient beings wore unreadable expressions. The death of a Nascent Soul cultivator was no trivial matter, nor was it something that just anyone or any faction could achieve.
The ability to deliver a fatal blow across tens of thousands of miles was like a sword hanging over every Nascent Soul cultivator's head. Not even the ancestors of major powers had time to intervene.
Many ancient cultivators became more cautious, vowing never to offend mysterious figures. They feared being dragged into the Forbidden Sea's demon lairs and dying without ever knowing their killer.
Within the Yu Clan's Stronghold, winds of turmoil swept through the region as every secluded Yu Clan cultivator emerged, their gazes fixed upon the heavens.
Enormous warships blotted out the sun, their thunderous roars shaking the entire sky. Killing intent stretched across thirty thousand miles.
Beside a large lake within the mountains, a new gravestone had appeared. Both the eldest and second brothers knew of his lingering attachments and buried him here to rest eternally beside his beloved wife.
Even now, they refuse to acknowledge their third brother as part of the Jiang family.
From this day forward, this place was sealed as a forbidden zone, never to be opened again—until the Yu family vanished from the annals of the Great Li Realm's history.
That Night. Shocking news spread far and wide: the Yu family officially declared war on the Jiang family!
Rogue cultivators from Great Li Realm's twenty prefectures fled in a frenzy. Some minor sects dissolved on the spot, scattering to the winds. A single strike from a Nascent Soul cultivator could shatter the earth or collapse mountains—who could stand against such power?
The great ancient sects all fell silent simultaneously, unwilling to become involved. The death of a Nascent Soul cultivator brought far too many uncertainties.
Even the Yao family remained tight-lipped. A thousand-year-long blood feud had just ended, and now the Great Li Realm was tearing itself apart. They had no desire to risk being drawn into reckoning by the Baili clan.
Within the Jiang Clan's Ancestral Grounds. The Jiang clan cultivators showed no panic. A war between the two clans merely brought longstanding issues into the open. The Yu family did not yet have the strength for an extermination war.
They had made all necessary preparations, uniting the clan from top to bottom to face the Yu family's wrath.
Deep within the ancestral grounds, two elderly men in white robes sat across from each other, playing a game of Go.
"Divination violates the natural order and cannot reveal everything, especially when calculating against an ancient cultivation family of equal standing."
"Dao Brother, do we know who killed Jingxin?"
One elder hesitated over his move, unwilling to place a piece. "The Blood Exchange Technique, along with certain secret Jiang clan inheritances—he took them with him. This matter will not end peacefully."
"The cultivator from the Forbidden Sea is not a bloodthirsty person. Otherwise, the Yu family would be in grave peril. However, the ultimate outcome would still be mutual destruction."
The other elder’s gaze was deep and calm. "Our Jiang clan did not capitalize on Jingxin's death for gain, and that person is the key to this restraint."
If Yu Jingxin had died at the hands of the Yu family, they would have been drawn into a war. His identity as a Jiang clan member would have complicated matters, making it easier to visit them openly.
The secrets of the Yu family were known only to the Jiang family. But none of this had gone according to plan; the battlefield had been the Forbidden Sea!
Clack.
A piece fell onto the board, exuding a sharp killing intent. The Jiang clan's trump cards were not located here. Even against a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, they still had the strength to fight.
"Dao Brother, will that person come to the Jiang family?"
"I cannot say. His movements are unpredictable, his aura elusive."
The elder lightly shook his head, his long white eyebrows fluttering slightly. "Their whereabouts are uncertain. Let this matter rest—do not provoke them further. Focus on resolving the Yu family issue first."
"Understood." The other elder nodded faintly, falling into deep thought. The Jiang clan's divination techniques were ultimately incomplete, and the backlash was extraordinarily severe.
The Next Day. Since his Dao Brother had spoken thus far, he dared not press further. There was likely an unimaginable secret surrounding that cultivator from the Forbidden Sea—so significant that even his Dao Brother didn’t dare act against them directly.
As for the Yu clan’s first ancestor, there were also too many mysteries shrouding them. Yu Jingxin’s death had been far too swift.
Furthermore, the incident occurred right on the Yu clan's own mountain. It was inconceivable that they would be caught so unprepared. Were they attempting to use someone else’s blade to eliminate a threat? Or perhaps to pressure the Jiang family?
In the upper echelons of the Great Li Realm, the powerful families had vast resources, but their struggles were always labyrinthine and complex.
Following this battle, the reputation of the "Forbidden Sea Demon Cultivator" rose dramatically throughout the Great Li Realm. Nascent Soul cultivators now recognized the name as thunderous and were wary at heart.
Many prodigies privately clicked their tongues upon hearing the news, inwardly cursing this individual. The Forbidden Sea was already perilous enough; now, with such a formidable presence, how could they compete for opportunities?
However, these matters no longer concerned Chen Xun and his companions.
Guiyi City.
Today, the cold wind was bone-piercing, like needles stabbing into the soul.
The "Forbidden Sea Demon Cultivator" roamed a bustling city with his two companions, buying goods while snacking and laughing along the way.
Sansheng Pavilion.
This was the largest merchant establishment in the city, rumored to be backed by a significant trade association. The place buzzed with activity, and cultivators came and went in an endless stream.
The group stepped inside their old habit of browsing for hidden treasures, kicking in as they wandered through the first floor.
Nearby, a few cultivators passed by with exaggerated expressions:
“Did you hear? That Forbidden Sea Demon Cultivator actually killed a Nascent Soul powerhouse!”
“Who hasn’t heard? The twenty prefectures are now in flames. Two great ancient cultivation families are fully at war, and even the price of God-killing Stones has shot up!”
“So, how about we head to the Tian Duan Plains? I hear many Daoist friends there are raking in riches.”
“Are you paying for the teleportation fee?”
“I... haha, just a thought, Daoist He. Why so serious?”
The group’s conversation gradually veered off course, ending in laughter and playful jests.
These were ordinary cultivators. Though they lived modestly, they enjoyed a carefree existence.
Chen Xun passed by them with a faint smile. To his surprise, he now had a nickname—Forbidden Sea Demon Cultivator. It did sound rather intimidating.
Meanwhile, the big black ox and Little Red were communicating via spiritual sense, happily exploring the goods on display.
The shelves overflowed with an array of cultivation resources, all available for purchase with spirit stones.
Little Red’s eyes darted everywhere, particularly drawn to unique materials and ores. It couldn’t help but take a closer look.
Back when it impersonated a lion demon to rob a Yu family disciple, it earned a severe beating from Brother Xun. The big black ox had to heal its wounds. These ores were excellent for recovery, and Little Red had taken a liking to them—it was never picky about food.
The big black ox remained interested in an array of materials. Although their eldest brother had provided plenty of spirit stones, it meticulously calculated its spending, nonetheless.
At that moment, a woman in a purple dress noticed Chen Xun, a Nascent Soul-level senior, and immediately approached him with a warm smile.
“Senior, may I assist you in finding anything? The first floor may not have what you’re looking for.”
“Heh, just browsing. Let’s talk on the second floor.”
Chen Xun glanced around, then called out to the big black ox and Little Red, “You two take your time. Meet me on the second floor later.”
With Little Red now part of the group, the big black ox had become chattier. Ever since arriving in human territory, it no longer felt lonely, which put Chen Xun at ease.
“Moo moo~~”
“Roar~~”
Their calls startled the nearby Qi Refinement cultivators, whose eyelids twitched wildly. They quickly cupped their hands in respect, marveling at how even these spirit beasts lived better than them!
Little Red was no longer afraid of Great Li Realm's human cultivators. With three elder brothers looking out for it—and no inclination to cause trouble—it moved about as if it owned the place.
