??? Watches for an Opportunity
* * *
Unforgivable.
Just that one word.
He could never forgive that thing.
Even now, he remembers it.
The final moments of his mother.
His kind, strong, and great mother.
The time when she became a silent corpse in a miserable state.
He can’t forgive it.
He can’t forgive that thing that killed his mother.
Absolutely unforgivable.
He can’t forgive himself either, for only being able to tremble and watch from behind an object as his mother died.
Therefore, he trained himself.
He trained his body, learned techniques, trained his mind, and gained wisdom.
He is no longer the powerless child from that time who could only tremble behind an object.
He is a warrior burning with the desire for revenge.
Therefore, he kept searching.
For his mother’s enemy.
With obsession, he kept searching.
To kill.
To thoroughly destroy that thing’s precious things, just like it did to him.
And finally, he found it.
He finally found it.
His mother’s enemy.
That demon!
Suppressing the desire to unleash his hatred and kill it right away.
He has become strong.
However, he mustn’t let his guard down.
He is not a beast driven and rampaging solely by the desire for revenge.
He has wisdom.
He will definitely kill that thing.
Kill it.
Kill it.
Absolutely kill it.
For that purpose.
For that purpose, he will now hide himself.
He will watch for an opportunity.
Now, who could it be?
