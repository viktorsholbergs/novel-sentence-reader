It was easy to lose track of time when one was cultivating. Li Tongya sat cross-legged on a rock atop the mountain, reading the Law of Celestial Moon.
Light and shadow mingled and danced around him as dewdrops fell, and in such moments of distraction, two months had fluttered by.
"The further I go, the more difficult it becomes..." Li Tongya murmured to himself. He had read about a fifth of the Law of Celestial Moon and already felt it was becoming increasingly challenging and confusing.
He shook his clothes and put away the jade slip, then glanced at the dew all around him. He mused, Although Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators have lengthy lifespans and no longer need food, the time spent in cultivation really flies by like a fleeting horse.
He took a few steps down to a stone table where an emerald jade pot and a white jade cup were placed. The jade pot, a luxury item of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, was warm to the touch due to the piping hot tea inside it. Li Xuanxuan was considerate and had someone deliver fresh tea to him daily.
"Xuan'er is over forty now, and it seems he won't make it to the Foundation Establishment Realm..." Li Tongya mumbled as he looked at the jade pot, thinking, The child is sensible, diving straight into the art of talisman… The family needs such people. If everyone aimed for Foundation Establishment Realm, hoping against hope and dying if they fail, what would become of our middle and upper echelon of martial power?
Collecting his thoughts, Li Tongya continued down the stone steps. A small hut appeared before him where an old woman, her hair white and face withered, sat quietly holding a leopard cat. She had several letters laid out in front of her.
Li Tongya paused and sighed, his face instantly aged as he wiped his hand across his face, transforming from a man in his forties to one nearing seventy. He then approached the lady and spoke softly.
"My dear…"
Liu Rouxuan turned her head, her eyes tired and old. She stood up in slight surprise when she caught his eyes.
"You're out of seclusion already, my dear? That was quick," she said.
Seeing Li Tongya remain silent, Liu Rouxuan felt a bit guilty and softly said, "I have failed again and wasted your spirit herbs."
Now only at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing realm, Liu Rouxuan had failed twice to condense the fifth Jade Capital Chakra, her lifespan further reduced.
Li Tongya had found many spirit herbs for her, but cultivation was becoming increasingly difficult, and even the status of an unrefined Qi Cultivator seemed out of her reach now.
Li Tongya placed two fingers together on Liu Rouxuan's wrist, closed his eyes for a few breaths, then took out a jade bottle from his storage pouch. He then whispered instructions to her, saying, "Take this healing medicine over three days; I will condense talisman water later. Take it twice every three days."
"My dear!" Liu Rouxuan coughed softly, interrupting Li Tongya, and smiled. "At this point, we should give up already… After losing lifespan twice now, I do not have many years left. It'd be too cruel to continue cultivating like this."
Li Tongya stiffened, feeling a pang in his heart. He stopped in his movements and took in Liu Rouxuan's aged face.
"All right," he said gently.
After a brief conversation, Li Tongya helped her into the house, as she had grown tired due to her now reduced lifespan and mana. Then, turning around, he saw a middle-aged man in gray clothes standing on the stone steps, cupping his fist.
"Father."
"Take good care of your mother," Li Tongya quietly instructed, watching as Li Xuanling nodded and entered the house. He then soared into the air, flying eastward.
Xiao Chuting's ceremony was set at Xianyou Peak, a majestic mountain with a robust earth vein and abundant spiritual qi. Its summit was shrouded in clouds and mist, and from time to time, figures shuttled through the air, alighting from the breeze. The Yue River flowed by, its clear waters carrying numerous boats.
Li Tongya landed at the foot of the mountain where a stone gateway stood. It was carved with many formation patterns, its surface shimmering with mana, substantial and thick. Two youths in brocade robes stood on either side of the gateway.
Upon seeing Li Tongya descend, they approached respectfully and greeted him.
"Greetings, Senior! May we ask which sect, which prefecture, or from which secluded immortal mountain does your immortal clan hail?"
Li Tongya nodded lightly and answered, "I dare not claim to be of the immortal clans, I am Li Tongya from the Li Family of Lijing."
The face of the youth on the right, adorned in brocade and silver boots, lit up immediately and responded respectfully, "Greetings, Senior Tongya! I am Xiao Guitu, Guiluan is my younger sister. Our families will soon be joined in marriage, and I hope for your continued favor!"
The youth on the left smiled politely, adding, "So, you are from a sword immortal clan! Please ascend the mountain, Senior; my clan's elder has been waiting for a long time."
Li Tongya nodded, and the Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators on either side stepped back, allowing a Qi Cultivator to come forward to lead the way. After all, a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator should be given distinguished treatment.
As soon as they passed through the stone gateway, a winding staircase appeared before them.
"Greetings, Senior Tongya! It has been decades, and you have already become a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator… That's truly impressive!" said the Qi Cultivator as they ascended the stairs, smiling warmly.
"Oh?" Li Tongya was slightly startled and curious, seeing that the cultivator was only at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
"You have seen me, yet I do not recognize you," Li Tongya continued, observing the man.
The cultivator smiled and replied, "I am from a branch of the Xiao Family, most closely related to Brother Yongling. That year, I had just formed the Profound Scenery Chakra and served Brother Yongling, working near Cloud Crowned Peak. That year, the snow was heavy, and it was cold in spring… I accompanied Elder Brother Yongling on a tour of our family properties, and we stopped at a tavern. We saw two men, dressed in simple attire belied their extraordinary demeanor. Elder Brother Yongling was delighted and drank with them. I was just one of many attendants, yet I listened to the inspiring conversation."
Li Tongya nodded in realization, and the Qi Cultivator laughed, "One of those men was called Wan Yuankai, and the other was you. It was a brief meeting at the tavern. After we left, I shared my impressions with Brother Yongling, especially about Wan Yuankai's mastery of the Azure Essence Chakra at such a young age, and his refined discourse. I felt he was not ordinary indeed. Elder Brother Yongling simply laughed and remarked that Wan Yuankai, despite his talents, was overly straightforward and naive. He said that he was more suited as a friend than a partner, being only above average. He then spoke highly of you, noting your cautious and profound character. He was convinced that given time, you would accomplish great things!"
Li Tongya couldn't help but smile, truly moved by the man's words. The Qi Cultivator chuckled softly and whispered, "Back then, I doubted his judgment… but seeing your achievements today, I realize Brother Yongling's insight was indeed remarkable."
Li Tongya shook his head, amused, his lips curling up in appreciation of the man's tactful flattery, which showed a keen and meticulous mind.
"It seems we were indeed destined to meet again!" Li Tongya laughed.
The Qi Cultivator nodded enthusiastically, and after a brief chat, he asked with some concern, "But I have not seen Wan Yuankai in many years; how is he now?"
Li Tongya paused and sighed deeply. "When the Golden Tang Gate moved south, the Wan Family was annihilated, and Brother Yuankai died in that conflict… over thirty years ago now."
The Qi Cultivator's expression faltered, his eyes dimming as he struggled to find words.
