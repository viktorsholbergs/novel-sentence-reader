"Daoist Jin Yu, my brother and I are used to a free and easy life, we have no intention of joining any faction." Chen Xun shook his head, his eyes filled with regret, "This is our bottom line, and I hope you understand."
"Daoist Chen, you might have misunderstood me."
"Huh?"
"I merely invited you two to stay as guests. Whether you stay or leave, Moon Tower will not force you." Jin Yu's words were gentle, giving herself a graceful exit, "The Nascent Soul techniques are very different from Golden Core techniques. I also have some humble insights to share with you."
"Moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun. Since they started their cultivation journey, they had never heard anyone speak about the Dao.
Chen Xun raised an eyebrow, feeling somewhat tempted. His main goal wasn't a fire attribute technique; he always had other considerations in mind.
But being a guest, eating and drinking their offerings, eventually, wouldn't that make them guest cultivators...
"I understand that Daoist Chen has concerns about being entangled with Moon Tower and potentially bringing disaster upon yourself in the future." Jin Yu took a sip from her teacup, then suddenly grew serious, "This matter will not be publicized in Nine Palaces Mountain. Tomorrow, I will announce that you two have already left."
"Daoist Chen and Daoist Ximen are simply visiting me in the Snow Listening Valley, and it has nothing to do with the Moon Tower."
"Since Daoist Jin Yu has put it this way." Chen Xun took out his own health tea from the storage pouch and took a sip, "Refusing repeatedly would make me seem ungrateful."
"Moo~~~" The big black ox let out a long breath, its eyes slightly widened.
Jin Yu breathed a sigh of relief, finally managing to keep them. However, if it were before the great war, Moon Tower would never have invited such mysterious Nascent Soul cultivators.
But times had changed. No matter the cost, as long as they could keep them as guests, some powers behind the scenes wouldn't dare to touch Moon Tower.
Two Nascent Soul cultivators with no affiliationsâ€”if offended, even the Top Ten Sects of the Qian Nation would have to think twice.
Chen Xun smiled slightly, naturally guessing Jin Yu's intentions. Everyone had their own goals, and as long as no bottom lines were crossed, there was room for negotiation.
"Xiang Jing," Jin Yu said calmly, her words carrying a wave of spiritual energy.
"Ancestor." An elder suddenly appeared respectfully beside her.
Chen Xun and the big black ox remained calm, showing no surprise, already beginning to observe the environment of Snow Listening Valley, feeling quite satisfied.
"Go to the Return Treasury Pavilion and fetch the 'Nine Luminaries Red Sky Art.'"
"Ancestor, that is the inheritance of the Nine Luminaries Ancestor..." The elder frowned, raising his head, knowing this technique was only for direct disciples, "Isn't this inappropriate?"
"I will..."
"Daoist Jin Yu, please wait." Chen Xun stood up, looking at the two with burning eyes, "An ordinary fire attribute Nascent Soul technique will do; otherwise, my brother and I will leave immediately."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded heavily, understanding his brother's intention.
"Daoist Chen?"
"Daoist Jin Yu, you don't understand. Such inherited techniques are impossible for me to practice; it is a family rule." Chen Xun bowed solemnly, always ready with a convincing story, "Practicing the techniques of predecessors is already a great favor; I dare not expect more."
Although Jin Yu and Xiang Jing didn't fully understand, they were greatly shaken. This theory was unprecedented; it was the first time they had heard it.
In the cultivation world, who doesn't pursue strength? Who could resist the temptation of a heaven-sent opportunity? No one would ever think to thank the creators of the techniques.
After hearing Chen Xun's words, both of their mindsets shifted slightly.
Xiang Jing couldn't help but bow to Chen Xun, eyes full of respect. Truly, this was a senior cultivator from a hidden sect.
"Alright, I understand." Jin Yu stood up and bowed slightly, her tone weary, "I almost disrupted your Dao heart; it was my fault."
"No worries, no worries," Chen Xun chuckled, waving his hand, "It was my fault for not explaining clearly."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox also waved its hoof, signaling Jin Yu not to take it to heart, thinking to itself that its big brother was just making things up.
"Xiang Jing, go to the Return Treasury Pavilion and carefully select a fire attribute Nascent Soul technique. Remember what Daoist Chen said." Jin Yu turned her head and took out a jade token from her storage ring, "Take this."
"Yes, Ancestor." Xiang Jing received it with both hands, slightly relieved, then turned to Chen Xun and the big black ox, "Honored seniors, I will prepare it now."
"Thank you for your trouble," Chen Xun said with a kind smile and a gentle nod.
"Moo~" The big black ox greeted as well.
**Whoosh!**
As a quick gust of wind and snow swept by, Xiang Jing disappeared.
Chen Xun and Jin Yu both sat down slowly, their faces showing some joy; everything was going smoothly.
"Daoist Chen, what do you think of the war in the Northern Territory?" Jin Yu personally poured Chen Xun a cup of tea, "The three cultivation worlds are involved, it may be difficult to end peacefully."
_Oh crap..._
Chen Xun and the big black ox trembled slightly. Starting a casual conversation with a discussion on world affairs was beyond their expertise.
But it was indeed appropriate for Nascent Soul cultivators to discuss such matters, rather than fighting over a few spirit herbs...
"Well... uh..." Chen Xun pretended to ponder, trying to scrape together his knowledge, and finally came up with something, "The bustling world is all for profit; as with the clamoring world is all for gain."
"Moo!!" The big black ox snorted in shock. Since when did his big brother have such profound knowledge?!
It frowned, muttering softly to itself, wondering if Chen Xun had been secretly reading books behind its back...
"Daoist Chen has quite a clear understanding," Jin Yu smiled gently, feeling that this statement, though vague, held some truth.
"Hehe." Chen Xun instinctively took a sip of his health tea, feeling a bit hot.
"But this conflict among the three factions might bring significant changes to the cultivation world. What are your plans?"
"What do you mean?"
"Moo?"
"News from the Northern Territory indicates several Nascent Soul cultivators have already fallen, and even the spirit beasts of the Northern Territory have joined the battle." Jin Yu took a deep breath, her expression becoming very serious, "Daoist Chen, the spiritual energy of the cultivation world is slowly depleting. They are not just fighting for profit."
Chen Xun and the big black ox were shocked. They had already sensed this on the Tian Duan Plains, let alone the cultivators who had lived here for thousands of years.
"Daoist Jin Yu is correct; we have also felt it slightly." Chen Xun's eyes grew dark; the words of a Nascent Soul cultivator indeed carried more weight than those of a Qi Refining disciple, "But that should take many years, right?"
"But perhaps now is the last prosperous period of the cultivation world." Jin Yu said coldly, "The path of cultivation is like sailing against the current; they can't afford to wait any longer and must take the lead."
Either unify the cultivation world, with one faction monopolizing all cultivation resources to sustain and explore further, or all perish together, plunging the cultivation world into chaos until new rulers emerge.
But the current prosperity of the cultivation world would never be seen again; this war was far more complex than outsiders imagined.
"Indeed," Chen Xun sighed, unable to fully empathize, so he didn't comment further.
"Moo~"
The big black ox, however, was listening with great interest, as if hearing a captivating story.
