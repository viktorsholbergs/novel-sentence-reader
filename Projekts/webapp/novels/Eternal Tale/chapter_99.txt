"Old Ox," Chen Xun stood in front of the cave, pausing, "Let's change to another hilltop and tidy up."
"Moo?" The big black ox looked puzzled. Didn't they already destroy the body, burn the bones to ashes?
"If this person had informed his elders before coming, wouldn't they have found us here?" Chen Xun's eyes narrowed slightly as he spoke in a deep voice, "We're on the path to immortality, and we have plenty of time to tidy up, but if trouble finds us, there will be too many unknown variables."
"Moo~" The big black ox widened its eyes and let out a heavy snort.
"Have you forgotten the story I told you about killing chickens when we left the small mountain village?" Chen Xun's tone went from low to high, his eyes deep as he looked at the big black ox. "Now, develop good habits, be cautious step by step, so we won't make big mistakes in the future!"
"Moo~~!" The big black ox roared in understanding, even thinking about taking out a little notebook to record every 'wise saying' of Brother Chen Xun.
"Old Ox, get to work!"
"Moo~"
The big black ox hurried into the cave, where the magic power raged, and a small formation was set up. The cave's underground holes slowly revealed their original appearance, filled with medicinal herbs.
Within an hour, everything was cleaned up. A loud explosion echoed from the cave, and countless rubble covered it.
The big black ox brought in a few more large rocks, and Chen Xun waved his hand, using magic to embed them into the cave entrance, blending them with the surrounding walls, creating a harmonious and natural look.
Even a master craftsman would have to admit that there was nothing wrong with this rock wall, and there was no cave inside.
After a few days, although Wang Chuan was a wandering cultivator, he wasn't an orphan. Several days later, the Wang family sent people to search the mountains because Wang Chuan had said he was going to cultivate his spells here and had to be alone.
With heavy rewards, many strong men and hunters were brought in from the city.
These hunters, accompanied by hunting dogs, searched the mountains frantically. If they found someone, they would be rewarded with a gold coin, but the hunting dogs shook their heads; they found no scent.
This incident gradually became a mystery in the city.
...
Another half month passed, and Chen Xun and the big black ox arrived at an unnamed mountain range, where they had been squatting for a long time, completely safe, with no human traces.
Countless peaks here smiled and slept, covered in the purple twilight, lying quietly on the undulating spring wilderness to the west.
They entered the deep mountains, where the roar of fierce beasts could be heard constantly. It was said that there were even monsters lurking here, and not even a single hunter could be found.
But if someone dared to be reckless, Chen Xun and the big black ox would make them understand what experience and skillful work meant.
Chen Xun held a mountain axe and opened another cave, while the big black ox dug holes in the ground and set up a small formation.
It went outside from time to time to bring back some soil, and even made a pond under the ground, busier than Chen Xun, which made the latter laugh and shake his head.
If these medicinal herbs were to be cultivated, simply putting them in a medicine box wouldn't suffice.
They worked neither hastily nor impatiently, neither arrogantly nor rashly. For them, lifespan had become nothing more than a number...
Another day passed, and the sky grew gloomy.
The big black ox was still busy, occasionally mooing at Chen Xun.
Chen Xun sat in front of the cave, looking at his mountain-opening axe, lost in thought and regret.
"Damn it..." Chen Xun cursed softly. He was so poor that he couldn't afford anything. He hadn't found any good materials on this journey, and he and the big black ox both believed it was just bad luck.
He took out the sapling of the Crane Spirit Tree from his storage bag, a faint smile curling his lips.
"My good brother, how about we let you have a try?" Chen Xun's eyes brightened, thinking, who said a mountain axe had to be made of gold materials? A Crane Spirit Tree would do just fine!
That Crane Spirit Tree King, even his current axe can't chop it, and it emits a deadly aura, something that can devour magical power and vitality.
"I'll be damned, a...Tetanus Mountain Axe?!" Chen Xun suddenly stood up and shouted, his eyes filled with shock as he realized!
"Moo?" The big black ox stuck its head out of the ground.
"Old Ox, how many years have we been on the wrong path?!" Chen Xun looked at the big black ox, excitedly laughing, "Your black coffin can be made from the Crane Spirit Tree, so can my mountain axe!"
"Moo? Moo moo~!" The big black ox also got excited and shouted several times, a black shadow directly jumping out, "Moo moo?"
"Hahaha...it can work, it definitely can!" Chen Xun grew more excited as he spoke, even lifting the big black ox in his arms triumphantly.
"Moo~~" The big black ox let out a startled cry.
"Haha, let's do this!" Chen Xun was already carried away with excitement.
However, he suddenly froze and gradually calmed down. "One hundred thousand years..."
"Moo?" The big black ox started doing arithmetic on the ground again, beads of sweat forming on its head.
"Old Ox, you go and busy yourself; I'll think some more."
"Moo~"
As the big black ox left, it comfortingly patted Chen Xun, calculating was a bit difficult.
Chen Xun sat in front of the cave again, lost in thought, muttering softly, "The essence of all things, 250 years for the Foundation Establishment stage, and 450 years for the Golden Core stage!"
"First cultivate spiritual herbs and form pills, then refine the lifebound magic treasure."
Chen Xun nodded slightly. The more he thought about it, the more reasonable it seemed. If they were to cultivate the Crane Spirit Tree, they wouldn't be able to cultivate their spiritual herbs.
This would waste a lot of meaningless time. Chen Xun took out his little notebook again and started writing and drawing.
His eyes were serious, and he realized that the black coffin of the big black ox could still be strengthened.
But even with the enhancement of their Water Spirit Technique, if they continued to strengthen the black coffin, it might be unable to suppress the death aura. Their strength wasn't there yet.
"Is the Water Spirit Technique really only three layers?" Chen Xun slowly looked up at the sky. Despite practicing so many minor spells, he still found this Water Spirit Technique quite peculiar and incomprehensible.
Moreover, they hadn't cultivated the Thousand Threads Spirit Vine to its limit. Mainly because they were afraid the alchemical fire couldn't burn continuously, making it impossible to extract threads.
There were just too many things. Chen Xun sighed softly again, then smirked quietly. Damn, our immortality...
Immersed in cultivation without the passage of time, the fierce beasts in the mountains suffered a great calamity.
The wild people in the mountains emerged again, followed by wild oxen, fighting the world. Countless fierce beasts howled in pain every night; damn it, don't eat anymore!
Every few months, wild people would come out of the cave with wild oxen, traversing mountains, and hills, chasing beasts recklessly, and laughing strangely and creepily.
Under the governance of the Ten Great Sects, the mortal realms of the Qian and Wu Nations became peaceful and prosperous.
To be honest, the commoners who could survive to this day whose ancestors didn't have a bit of immortal bloodline? Otherwise, how could they still be alive? They didn't just appear out of thin air.
This was also the main reason why the cultivation world could continue to thrive. In the mortal world, there always seemed to be some inexplicable geniuses in cultivation, as if their bloodlines had reverted...
In history, there were indeed cases where powerful cultivators slaughtered innocent people and fought in the city until blood flowed like rivers, but they were rare. Of course, wars were not included.
But now, I bet you haven't even made a move, and the first of the Ten Great Sects will have already killed you.
After all, when Chen Xun was in the Five Elements Sect, the Outer Hall Elders often sent Ji Kun and others out to deal with evil cultivators, not to mention the Ten Great Sects.
Although mortals' lives were as insignificant as grass and mustard, they couldn't be trampled upon by cultivators at will. There was always order within it.
