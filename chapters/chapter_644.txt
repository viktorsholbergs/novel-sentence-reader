Li Xizhi smiled and responded, "Master Liu, please inspect the area again. The geomantic lines have shifted over the years, revealing several new subsidiary peaks. The earth veins have also changed."
Liu Changdie stroked his beard and nodded. "I have already taken that into account. It poses no major issue."
Excellent!" Li Xizhi immediately regarded him more highly and didn't bother asking about the power of the formation or the specific methods to set it up. Instead, he asked directly, "How many spirit stones and materials will the master require?"
Liu Changdie calculated briefly and responded, "The clan has grown significantly and is no longer what it was in the past. I will not use an ordinary formation to brush this off. I intend to set up a Foundation Establishment Realm formation using spirit water as the primary vein, leveraging the mountain's water channels. Altogether, this will cost four hundred spirit stones."
"Oh?" Li Xizhi chuckled and shook his head. His knowledge was vast—how could a Foundation Establishment Realm formation cost only four hundred spirit stones? Moreover, collecting five types of spirit water of sufficient quality alone would exceed that amount. Liu Changdie clearly intended to cover part of the cost himself.
However, Li Xizhi didn't allow him the chance. "You jests," he said. "How could we let you cover these expenses? The spirit water and materials will be collected by my family. As for the spirit stones, we will provide you with one hundred upfront. If that proves insufficient, feel free to request more."
"Wait!" Liu Changdie's expression changed dramatically. He quickly protested, "What… what does this mean? The bond between your family and me—"
Li Xizhi waved his hand, his gaze solemn. His calm eyes fixed on Liu Changdie as he spoke softly, "Uncle has had a hard enough time on his own. Now that my family is capable, it is only right that we shoulder this burden. My father valued your friendship deeply and would surely not wish to see you in such circumstances."
Liu Changdie had been prepared to stubbornly refuse whatever Li Xizhi might say, but he was caught off guard by the sincerity in his words. Hearing himself addressed as "Uncle"—a term so familiar from his previous life—left him momentarily speechless.
Dazed, Liu Changdie nodded and, after a long silence, cupped his fist in respect. Yet, it didn't feel like he was addressing just the present Li Xizhi, but someone else entirely, as if acknowledging his role as a loyal retainer to a benefactor from long ago.
"I will go survey the earth vein immediately," he said quietly.
After bowing slightly, Liu Changdie turned and departed.
Li Xizhi watched Liu Changdie leave, sensing something strange but unable to pinpoint it. His demeanor and actions bore a familiarity that reminded him of Chen Donghe and An Zheyan, loyal old retainers whose mannerisms were deeply ingrained in their service.
The sensation felt utterly absurd, so Li Xizhi quickly pushed it out of his mind. After waiting for a short while, Li Qinghong descended into the hall, carried by the wind.
Everyone except for Li Xuanxuan promptly stood up. Li Qinghong scanned the room, her gaze sweeping across the crowd before gesturing for them to sit down. She then asked, "How did it go?"
Li Xizhi quickly recounted what had just transpired. Li Qinghong nodded, her brows arching slightly as she retrieved two gray-black stone bottles from her storage pouch.
These two items were obtained during her demon-slaying expeditions. Unlike the usual delicate jade bottles used for treasures on the mainland, they were stored in crudely carved stone bottles. Speaking softly, she said, "These are two types of spirit water—Far-Sea Serpent Stream from the Converge Water system and Stone-Heart Water from the Valley Water system. Two of the five are accounted for."
As her voice trailed off, Li Xuanxuan, who had been silent until then, spoke with his deep, elderly voice. "There is another spirit water in our possession. It was obtained by Jun'er and me during our travels in the Helin Mountain Range. It is called Forest Cold Water, though the texts do not specify which water system it belongs to."
He retrieved a jade bottle from his robe. Li Xizhi glanced at it briefly before handing it back. "Converge Water."
Li Xuanxuan sighed with regret. "We also obtained a Pure Essence Spirit Water in that mountain range, but it was used in cultivating perception techniques, and only a fraction remains—not enough to make a full share."
With three of the five spirit waters gathered, Yang Xiao'er, who had remained quiet until now, stepped forward. Speaking gently, she said, "I happen to have another spirit water. It was gifted to me long ago by the peak but remained unused due to its rarity. I have always carried it with me."
From the jade ring on her feathered robe, she retrieved a silver-white jade bottle. Handing it over, she explained, "This is White Feather No-Fall. Among the Five Waters, it belongs to the Mansion Water system. Mansion Water, known as Inferior Water in ancient times, is one of the rarer types of the Five Waters, with little recorded about its uses, which is why I have kept it until now."
Li Xizhi paused before accepting the bottle. He handed it to Li Xuanxuan, saying, "When I return to the sect, I will ensure Xiao'er is compensated. Keep this within the family."
Li Xuanxuan expressed his thanks, understanding that the couple did not distinguish personal belongings so strictly and that these words were merely to reassure him. After a brief calculation, they realized they were still missing one more spirit water.
Li Qinghong handed over the collected items to Li Xuanxuan. "Wait here," she said decisively. "I will make a trip to the market and acquire the last spirit water."
True to her swift and decisive nature, she wasted no time. Mounting the wind, she quickly departed southward.
The rest stayed behind, engaging in conversation. Li Chengliao was sent to prepare the family's upcoming ritual. As they discussed, a man approached from below.
Clad in black robes, his expression dark and somber, the man drifted across the ground and kneeled before Li Yuexiang. His cultivation was at the mid-Foundation Establishment Realm.
"My lady, the clan has gathered some information and sent me to deliver it." Li Wushao presented a jade slip with both hands. Li Yuexiang gently took it and examined its contents.
"Yuan Fuyao, aged twenty-nine, Qi Cultivation Realm, practices the Azure Manifestation technique. Unknown specifics about this method..." She casually flipped through the details, skipping most of them. She let out a small laugh and asked, "Does he have any childhood sweethearts?"
Li Wushao bowed his head and replied, "It has been said that he had some past involvement with a lady from the Song Family. Back then, the Song Family still had Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... In recent years, the family has declined, and the relationship was severed."
"I see," Li Yuexiang responded nonchalantly.
Li Wushao added, "It has also been said that Yuan Fuyao has been inquiring everywhere about the matter of the dowry, but every attempt has run into our people, so he has received no useful information."
"Oh?" Li Xuanxuan exchanged a glance with Li Yuexiang, stroking his beard with a faint, knowing smile that bespoke a seasoned understanding of human nature. His deep voice carried a tone of amused sympathy as he said, "It is no surprise he is curious. With wealth of this magnitude, if it were his alone, it would benefit three generations."
Looking left and right, Li Xuanxuan continued, "Lacking guidance from an early age, unaware of the shifting tides, and though his character remains upright, he is, after all, just an ordinary person. This kind of behavior is hardly unusual."
Although his words were understanding, the disappointment in his tone was unmistakable. Li Xizhi, meanwhile, looked up in mild surprise and asked, "What is this? The Yuan Family wants to marry into our family? Which young talent is courting my sister?"
Li Yuexiang began explaining, recounting the events in full detail. Li Xizhi listened closely, one hand resting on the armrest while the other absentmindedly toyed with a faintly glowing rainbow light. A mischievous smile spread across his face as he remarked, "I think I will go meet him myself."
Li Xuanxuan had anticipated this response and sighed, nodding his approval. However, as he glanced at Li Yuexiang's cheerful expression, he couldn't help but chuckle.
As the eldest and most experienced member of the family, Li Xuanxuan had seen much in his time. He instantly recognized that Li Wushao's timely delivery of this information was no coincidence. Internally, he mused, This clever girl, always testing the waters effortlessly. But Zhi'er indulges her too much to let her be disappointed.
