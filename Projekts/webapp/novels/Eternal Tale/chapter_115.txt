"Moo~" The big black ox rubbed against Chen Xun; its eyes filled with joy.
"Old ox, remember the way from the South City to the East City?" Chen Xun joked, "We have had a surge of energy after the breakthrough, so we don't need to rest every day."
"Moo!"
The big black ox snorted angrily. When it comes to navigation, it has never feared anyone.
"Old ox, let's go. I've set my sights on several alchemy shops along the way. Let's sell the spirit medicines we've cultivated over the past six months." Chen Xun began communicating through telepathy, "After all, they're just century-old ones, not worth many spirit stones, but it'll take some time to sell them separately. We must not be careless."
The corners of the big black ox's mouth lifted slightly, giving Chen Xun a knowing look.
Gradually, they disappeared into the bustling streets. After an hour, they entered a thriving alchemy shop, with even the big black ox walking in.
However, the people inside showed no surprise. Anyone who could open a shop in the Imperial City was well-versed.
Several Foundation Establishment stage attendants saw the Foundation Establishment seniors and didn't dare to approach. They didn't have the qualifications.
"Friend, what do you wish to purchase? We can discuss it upstairs," a white-clad old man said, smiling as he approached. "The first floor only has some Qi Refinement stage elixirs, which I presume won't catch your eye."
"Please." Chen Xun nodded solemnly, as if he had a lot on his mind.
Even the big black ox stood there blankly. It would be difficult to discern anything from its expression.
On the second floor, there were fewer people, with some samples of elixirs placed around, and some elixir formulas for sale, all with a layer of restrictions placed on them.
They entered a small, elegant room, sat down on the floor, and the white-clad old man poured them tea, doing everything methodically.
Business was particularly important to them and was also a form of good karma. Social etiquette was never lacking anywhere.
"I wonder if your esteemed shop accepts spirit medicines?"
"Oh? So, friend, you've come to sell spirit medicines." The white-clad old man smiled leisurely. "I wonder what kind of spirit medicines they are and from which year?"
Chen Xun still wore that heavy-hearted expression. There was a hint of pain in his eyes. He flew three medicine boxes out of his storage bag and placed them on the table.
The white-clad old man had been secretly observing Chen Xun's expression. He was overjoyed. Could it be that he was in trouble and wanted to sell something good?
With a click, the three medicine boxes opened, revealing three spiritual herbs.
"Mi Jing Grass, 150 years old; Jade Source Flower, 120 years old; Black Sandalwood Mushroom, 100 years old!" Chen Xun introduced each one, then gritted his teeth and, with bloodshot eyes, said, "Friend, give me an offer!"
"Moo!" The big black ox also bellowed from the side, boosting its momentum.
The white-clad old man's pupils contracted, widening his eyes. He almost shouted, "Is this all?!"
Although these three spiritual herbs were usable at the Foundation Establishment stage, the years were too common. The white-clad old man felt disappointed. It was just a fleeing effortâ€¦ But he still greeted Chen Xun with a smile.
"Friend, how about five hundred low-grade spirit stones?"
"Unsuitable. These three spiritual herbs are impeccable in terms of medicinal properties and integrity. They can still be cultivated further. Add at least fifty more, and don't take me for an ignorant person," Chen Xun said with a serious expression.
"Moo!" The big black ox's gaze was sharp, echoing Chen Xun's words. It also felt that what its big brother said was right.
The white-clad old man narrowed his eyes slightly, probing with his spiritual sense. After a while, he nodded, "Indeed, they are quite good."
In the end, both parties were happy with the deal. Five hundred and fifty low-grade spirit stones were exchanged. The white-clad old man also told Chen Xun that if he had more spiritual herbs in the future, he could come to their shop.
Chen Xun looked straightforward and repeatedly promised to come next time. Then, leading the big black ox, he turned and left. The white-clad old man glanced at them, then went to greet others.
On the street, Chen Xun and the big black ox began to communicate telepathically.
"Old ox, we can not only sell spiritual medicines but also sell elixirs."
"Moo? Moo!"
"My alchemy skills... A few days ago, I dreamt that, setting aside the facts, the Alchemy Saint prostrated himself and begged me to impart wisdom."
"Moo?!" The big black ox widened its eyes, believing without a doubt, and nudged Chen Xun.
"It's the kind of expert who's a thousand times stronger than me but lacks my alchemy skills." Chen Xun began boasting, leaving the big black ox stunned.
Countless cultivators brushed past them on the road. A person danced and gestured earnestly, while an ox earnestly watched, never doubting, occasionally laughter and "moo" sounds could be heard.
In the following two months, they ran all over the South City, occasionally selling three-century-old spirit medicines to various major shops.
Because they only went to large stores and were quite far apart, no one paid attention to these poor cultivators, and they never left the city without any trouble.
When tired, they still found a secluded corner to rest, look at the stars and the moon, plan for the future, and restore their spiritual energy. The spiritual energy of this Imperial City couldn't be wasted.
Now they had three thousand low-grade spirit stones on them. They decided to stop selling spirit medicines for the time being.
Moreover, Chen Xun had already discovered that the price of these elixirs was much higher than that of ordinary low-year spirit medicines, making them extremely cost-effective for him, with almost minimal risk.
Sometimes they inquired about where to buy cultivation techniques. Golden core techniques for five-element spiritual roots shouldn't be difficult to find. They weren't demanding.
If possible, they wouldn't mind buying a copy of the Nascent Soul techniques...
Today the sun was shining brightly, and everything was fine.
Two shadows emerged from a deserted corner. They always seemed to have a smile on their faces, even if they were sleeping on the street, they weren't as distressed as the other cultivators.
"Let's go, old ox, let's go check out the cultivation techniques."
"Moo~"
They had inquired and found that there was a large store opened by Moyu Pavilion in the South City, north of the city, near the central city. They sold everything.
Two hours later, Chen Xun and the big black ox stopped outside a quite magnificent attic.
The attic had seven floors and occupied a considerable area. Cultivators came and went continuously, all knowing that the things sold here were of good quality.
They stood on the edge of the street, watching from afar.
"Old ox, with such a large area, it probably costs tens of thousands of spirit stones to secure it." Chen Xun looked up in amazement, truly broadening his horizons. "Let's go in and take a look."
"Moo!" The big black ox was shocked and followed him quickly.
This kind of cultivator city was completely different from mundane cities, scattered cultivator gathering places, or sects.
For Chen Xun and the big black ox, who were immortals, it was the ultimate experience, the purest enjoyment.
Entering the attic, it was bustling, and even the big black ox stood up, making it easier to walk when there were many people.
The first floor was specifically open for the Qi Refinement stage, with a wide range of items for sale, divided into several areas, including materials for demonic and spiritual beasts.
Chen Xun wandered around with the big black ox in the rune area for a long time. Many of the brushes, cinnabar, and yellow paper were made from the materials of demonic beasts.
It was said that if combined with the blood of spiritual beasts, it would greatly enhance the effect of the runes.
"Old ox, when we were in the Five Elements Sect back then, we didn't find many demonic or spiritual beasts, just a lot in the Southern Dipper Mountain." Chen Xun transmitted his thoughts to the big black ox, "I estimate that after so many years of development in the Qian Nation, some demonic beasts have been exterminated."
"Moo~" The big black ox agreed and glanced at the plaque outside.
"Old ox, Moyu Pavilion isn't from the Qian Nation. It probably has connections abroad. That's how it got rich." Chen Xun smiled faintly, looking at the many runes on the counter with envy.
He actually dabbled in this field a little, but the materials were too scarce.
