Li Ximing returned to the courtyard and opened the lid of the blackened furnace, revealing the medicinal liquid inside. It was crystal clear, slightly gray, and somewhat sticky.
"Phew! It's still alright!"
The process was quick, and the elixir in the furnace had not yet solidified enough to ruin this batch—proof of Li Ximing's high talent and the teachings of Xiao Yuansi. Since returning home, he had yet to spoil a single batch of elixir.
After completely refining the pills, six emerged successfully from the furnace. Li Ximing stored them in a jade bottle when he was suddenly interrupted by two knocks at the door.
Li Ximing frowned slightly as the door creaked open and a person entered, respectfully announcing, "My lord, there's a female cultivator outside who was sent by the family head. She is seeking guidance."
"Seeking guidance...?" Li Ximing echoed. Despite being a bit startled, he commanded softly, "Bring her over."
The attendant retreated, and soon after, a woman entered the courtyard.
This woman appeared no older than twenty, with a graceful posture and fair skin, and was dressed in a green gown. With an innocent blink of her eyes, she bowed and said, "Meng greets Senior."
Li Ximing regarded her quietly and replied softly, "Ah, so you're from the Meng Family."
Meng Zhuoyun, sensing Li Ximing's slightly inappropriate gaze, maintained her respectful demeanor and explained, "I was ordered to seek Senior's guidance on the dao of alchemy... The family head has approved this arrangement."
"Good," Li Ximing replied, observing her with an intrigued expression before instructing, "Call forth your core flame so I can examine it."
His conversation with Li Yuanjiao had just concluded when Meng Zhuoyun arrived, arousing his suspicion.
Unsure and a bit cautious, Li Ximing thought to himself, Could it be that the Meng Family is ready to join our family, using this woman's charms as a tactic? She's close to breaking through to the Qi Cultivation Realm… She could be quite beneficial to my cultivation.
Meng Zhuoyun was a beauty with soft skin and fine features. It was no surprise that Li Ximing had no immunity against her. While he shared the secrets of alchemy, his mind was preoccupied with something else.
Meng Zhuoyun was no longer a naive girl; her sharp mind was already at work.
This Li Ximing seems different from the rest of the Li Family. I've heard he's quite taken with beauty… If I can endear myself to him, perhaps I could secure a better position within the Li Family.
Both harboring their own motives, they exchanged glances that were filled with unspoken intentions, their voices softening as they spoke.
Li Xijun did not have to kneel in the ancestral hall for long. He was allowed to resume his cultivation after just a few days.
Yet, Kongheng, concerned, visited often to check on him.
The Li Family operated smoothly until the arrival of spring. When the snow had melted, mana light hurriedly approached from the west amidst clouds and fog.
It halted at the boundary of the Li Family's territory. Xu Gongming, a mid-stage Qi Cultivator, immediately flew out to greet the visitor, cupping his fist as he began, "Fellow Daoist…"
The figure within the light materialized, revealing a burly man with an intense glare who was fully dressed in leather armor. He barked, "Is this the Li Family of Lijing?"
Xu Gongming, clearly taken aback by his tone, corrected him, "It's known as Li Family of Qingdu..."
The burly man's eyes reddened with intensity as he demanded, "I don't care whether it's Qingdu or whatever! I want to know if your family has the Wanglin Blossom!"
Realizing the man was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Xu Gongming was shocked and stammered hastily, "M-My family does possess this item... May I know why you're looking for it, Senior...?"
The burly visitor was delighted by the response. He grabbed Xu Gongming by the collar and said forcefully, "Bring it to me quickly… or I'll make you miserable!"
Captured in his grip, Xu Gongming felt intense pain shooting through his limbs. His lungs felt like they were on fire as he barely managed to gasp out, "Please wait a moment, Senior… I'll inform the elders!"
The man reluctantly released him and urged, "Go, go, go!"
Xu Gongming wasted no time, quickly descending to alert the family. The Jade Court Guards had already noticed the commotion and gathered around.
Li Xicheng arrived, propelled by the wind, demanded in a stern voice, "What's going on here? Why is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from another clan here?"
After Xu Gongming explained the situation, Li Xicheng frowned and said, "What nonsense is this! We're due to submit our tributes next year… The recent harvests of Wanglin Blossoms had long been sold to other clans. There's none reserved for him."
"Although we have kept a few for personal use, they are stored in the old ancestor's cave dwelling, and he has long retreated into seclusion!" he added.
While the two men were still discussing, the burly man above interrupted impatiently, "Enough talking! Does your family have the flower or not? Don't waste my time!"
His urgency was palpable as he stepped forward, reaching out commandingly. A group of cultivators, sensing a potential threat, rushed to surround Li Xicheng protectively.
Chen Mufeng, who was standing nearby, called out, "I'd advise you to think carefully before you act, Senior!"
The burly man halted abruptly. Though anxious, he was rational. With a stern look, he gritted his teeth and demanded, "Then bring out the flower, quickly!"
Li Xicheng was equally nervous as he commanded, "Go to Qingdu and summon the old ancestor immediately!"
As soon as he had finished speaking, thunder rolled, echoing across the heavens and earth, drowning out the rest of his voice with its resonant boom.
Rumble!
Dark clouds amassed from the south, accompanied by thunder that had been suppressed throughout the long winter. As the first thunderclap of spring reverberated, a brilliant purple light surged forward from the south.
"Fellow Daoist, you seek favor yet act so imperiously… It seems you hold little regard for my family!"
From the south, a Foundation Establishment Realm female cultivator in jade armor arrived amidst the storm, her heroic presence commanding respect. Her fine eyebrows above her beautiful almond eyes knitted together, conveying her warning.
Her long black hair fluttered in the wind, accentuating her delicate ears. Strands of purple electricity flickered through her hair, casting silver-white halos that captivated everyone present, rendering them speechless.
Holding her silver-white lance upside down, Li Qinghong descended valiantly before them.
"Auntie!" Li Xicheng exclaimed joyously, overwhelmed with emotion. He was visibly excited and failed to contain his laughter.
Li Qinghong nodded slightly, her gaze softening as she looked at her family members. She stepped on the rolling thunder and lightning beneath her feet, closing the distance between them.
Behind her, Li Wushao stood in awe, bowing slightly as he respectfully retreated a step. His clothes seemed scorched and tattered, as if he had been beaten up not long ago.
The previously belligerent man was initially offended, yet when his gaze landed on her, he was struck by her stunning presence.
His confidence waned slightly as he asked in a softer tone, "And who might you be?"
Li Qinghong was dressed neatly, her appearance heroic and unadorned by makeup. The lively purple lightning around her lent an air of majesty and invincibility to her already commanding presence.
With dense purple electricity flickering in her eyes, she announced her name proudly.
"Li Qinghong from the Li Family of Qingdu."
