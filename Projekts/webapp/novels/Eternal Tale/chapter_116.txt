“Moo~”
The big black ox looked towards the area where the array formation was, its eyes showing contemplation, not knowing what it was thinking.
There were many array flags, array formation materials, and even complete array plates for sale there, no need to set up the array oneself, just take it and use it directly.
Chen Xun also looked over there. "Old ox, you go over there and take a look. Call me if you need anything."
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox called twice, nodding frantically. Chen Xun really understood it too well.
They began to wander around on the first floor. Even though they were only items for the Qi Refinement stage, there were still many things they had never seen before, just able to pronounce their names.
But what Chen Xun and the big black ox cared about most was still the issue of price, which was barely acceptable on the first floor.
They went up to the second floor.
After an hour, two figures rushed down, their expressions shocked, and then they burst out of the pavilion.
"Damn! Old ox, run!"
"Moo moo!!"
One person and one ox shouted in their minds. There was no hesitation in their eyes, just running. They disappeared in a flash from the street.
In a small, elegant room on the second floor, a Foundation Establishment stage woman sat in shock, holding a cup of hot tea in her hand, and not putting it down.
Who were these people? Were they Foundation Establishment cultivators?
Just now, a person and an ox appeared to be experts, with no flaws visible whatsoever. They even asked to study Five-Element Mixed Spirit Root cultivation methods.
One set for the Qi Refinement stage, one set for the Foundation Establishment stage, and they even wanted a set for the Golden Core stage.
Such experts naturally required the best from the pavilion. The ordinary items were priced at 7,000 low-grade spirit stones, while the better ones were 4,000 low-grade spirit stones.
...
On the street,
“Damn it!” Chen Xun cursed in his heart.
The items outside were much more expensive than those in the sects. He used to think the Contribution Hall in the sect was black, but now that he was out, he realized the sect might still be okay.
The big black ox also trembled in its heart. The array formation materials were too expensive, and it almost wanted to write a note saying it could be exchanged with contribution points.
Especially in shops run by such major forces, the prices were several times higher than those of ordinary shops, completely unaffordable for ordinary cultivators.
"Old ox, let's buy a cave residence." Chen Xun took a deep breath, feeling frustrated. "Living outside, it always feels lacking without a place to stay."
"Moo!"
The big black ox nodded heavily, exhaling a breath. Although they often wandered around, they always wanted a home in their hearts.
They dashed all the way. Now, all other thoughts are gone. First, buy a cave residence! Then plan for the future.
In East City, at the foot of Qin Immortal Mountain, there was the Cultivation Heart Pavilion.
Its demeanor was quite solemn, with tall halls and majestic gates. The stone steps were intentionally left unpolished, giving them a rough yet heavy feeling.
Chen Xun and the big black ox observed for a while at the foot of the stone steps. There was no noise here, but there must be a Golden Core cultivator in the Cultivation Heart Pavilion.
They could vaguely sense the fluctuations of spiritual energy. There were very few passing cultivators around, most of them had already bought what they could afford, and those who couldn't afford it wouldn't come here to feel uncomfortable.
"Let's go, old ox."
Chen Xun's heart was inexplicably excited, feeling that what they bought here would definitely be better than the cave he dug in the mountains.
"Moo!" The big black ox was excitedly nudging Chen Xun, already a little impatient.
They stepped forward and walked quickly into the Cultivation Heart Pavilion. The pavilion was quite spacious, with soundproof formations and elegant rooms everywhere.
After so many years of development in the Qian Nation's cultivation world, cultivators' psychology was well understood. Keeping wealth hidden and privacy protected would stimulate the cultivators' desire to spend more.
After all, this was not the mortal world. If it were treated like a market, fighting, and causing trouble would only discourage everyone from doing business.
While Chen Xun and the big black ox were looking around, a young man at the Foundation Establishment stage walked over from the side.
"Are you here to choose a cave residence, Daoist friend?"
"Yes, I hope fellow Daoist can guide us." Chen Xun clasped his hands, his expression calm.
"Please." The young man, with one hand behind his back, spoke with remarkable composure.
They entered an elegant room surrounded by exquisite landscape paintings, giving off a serene atmosphere that naturally calmed the mind.
"Moo~"
The big black ox's gaze was instantly drawn to these paintings, somehow feeling that they were better than the ones Chen Xun painted...
Chen Xun unintentionally clenched his fists and glanced at the big black ox, scaring the latter, whose pupils immediately contracted, quickly retracting its gaze.
They sat down on the floor. This time, there was no tea brewing. There was only an incense burner on the wooden table, emitting a mysterious fragrance that seemed to have a calming effect. Professional.
Chen Xun sighed inwardly. Others were quite skilled at living their lives.
"Are you looking to purchase a Black Grade cave residence or a Yellow Grade cave residence?" The young man took out two jade slips without a hurry. "Only Golden Core seniors are qualified to purchase Heaven Grade and Earth Grade residences. I hope fellow Daoist won't mind."
"Of course not." Chen Xun smiled and nodded. This person's words were truly refreshing. "We would like to purchase a Yellow Grade cave residence."
"I see." The young man calmly withdrew one of the jade slips, his eyes showing no hint of disdain. He then placed the other jade slip on the table. "Please have a look."
"Thank you." Chen Xun probed into it with his spiritual sense and asked the big black ox to do the same.
"Now, there are still some remote locations available for Yellow Grade cave residences. The spiritual energy is not as rich as in other residences, but the facilities inside are complete." The young man spoke calmly, without any intention to deceive. "If fellow Daoist are not satisfied, you can also purchase a residence at the foot of the mountain and come back when new residences are available."
Chen Xun felt relieved to hear this. He even felt like buying one, even though he didn't want to.
The big black ox directly thanked him with a few moos, deeply moved. Others' generosity was truly beyond what some minor cultivation families could compare with.
The young man smiled faintly at the big black ox, still calm and indifferent in his eyes.
"Daoist friend, this Yellow Grade cave residence, Serial Number 3587, costs how many spirit stones?" Chen Xun politely asked.
"2400 low-grade spirit stones, usable for 200 years, but 'outsiders' cannot be brought in at will." The young man looked at Chen Xun's puzzled expression and explained further, "There is a Gathering Spirit Array in Qin Immortal Mountain. If there are too many people, it may cause some chaos."
Chen Xun understood. Others had already said it quite subtly. The implicit meaning was not to bring in a large group of people to freeload off the Gathering Spirit Array...
"Alright, Daoist friend, we'll take this cave residence." Chen Xun gritted his teeth and bought it in full!
"Moo!" The big black ox instinctively let out an excited moo. They had never bought real estate along their journey!
Under the slightly surprised gaze of the young man, Chen Xun took out five stores, and the big black ox also rummaged out five more.
Small hexagonal spirit stones spilled out of the storage bags, gradually piling up on the ground.
The young man probed with his spiritual sense, neither too much nor too little, all intact, low-grade spirit stones. The storage ring on his hand instantly collected the spirit stones from the ground.
This time, Chen Xun and the big black ox were surprised again. It was actually a legendary storage ring!
But it was obviously public property and not his own.
The young man took out a prohibition token from the storage ring. With a flick of his finger, his spiritual energy continuously enveloped himself, and a stream of spiritual energy instantly entered the jade slip.
He looked at Chen Xun and placed the token on the table. "Please accept this, Daoist friend. This is the token for entering Qin Immortal Mountain and your own cave residence."
