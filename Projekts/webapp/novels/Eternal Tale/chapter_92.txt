Time continuously moves forward, and the wheels of history crush the nation of Wu, seemingly transforming it into the dust of history.
However, the grievances between the Wu and Qian Nations have accumulated for over a thousand years, especially in the mortal realm. When Chen Xun was in the Ningyun Mountains, the Wu Nation invaded, and the world was in chaos.
Throughout history, the two countries always clashed, and many heroic deeds that brought tears to one's eyes occurred.
The upper echelons of the Qian Nation's cultivation world had long been planning, even planting many spies in the major Wu sects, using the sealed Southern Dipper Mountain secret realm as the ultimate trigger.
All for the purpose of forcing major sects to go all out and launch a war!
Chen Xun and the big black ox, like numerous foundation-building cultivators, sway with the wind and rain, like insignificant beings in the vast universe.
They are not the legendary protagonists of the world, awaited by all countries to save the world in a moment of crisis.
Perhaps they died in some unknown place, unnoticed by anyone, and the history books wouldn't leave even a faint stroke for them.
Chen Xun and the big black ox wait for news from the front lines at Five Elements Sect every day. The returning corpses are increasing, and there are even large cultivators in the Golden Core stage.
They also exchanged many anti-aging items at the Contribution Hall, where Resplendent Vitality Pills are quite expensive. The Five Elements Sect didn't prepare such mediocre pills.
In general, by the Foundation Building stage, some people look excessively young, while others appear excessively old. No one cares about their appearance anymore, unlike mortals, who are obsessed with appearances.
However, the matter of immortality is something no one dares to imagine. It is beyond the understanding of all cultivators, and there are no rumors about it.
After all, the cultivation world also has its 'scientific' basis, not as whimsical as the wild imagination of mortals.
They mostly think that you might be a hidden powerhouse with overwhelming cultivation or an old monster hiding to recover from injuries.
Such rumors and facts are quite numerous. In short, there is no time to hide...
Within the Five Elements Sect.
Every day, there are sounds of hammering and crafting in the Gathering Spring Stream Medicinal Garden.
Chen Xun and the big black ox are living leisurely. The Millennium Silk Vine has been destroyed after extracting its silk, but there is still a long way to go.
This kind of silk, Chen Xun tried before; it can't be burned by ordinary alchemical fire, and the Yellow-Rank Iron Essence Mountain Opening Axe couldn't cut it either.
Their divine sense of probing is like a stone sinking into the sea without any response. It seems to be swallowed up or penetrated, which is incredibly mysterious.
Chen Xun plans to make a complete set of ferocious bandit equipment for himself and the big black ox. When the time comes, he will refine it once more, making it invincible against anyone.
The interior of the big black ox's coffin will be constructed with the silk of the spirit vine, making it a precious treasure.
Chen Xun also starts to explore refining techniques continuously. This alchemical fire is really useful. He also went to the Contribution Hall with the big black ox to exchange for many refining techniques.
...
Time passes slowly, and a hundred years have passed in the blink of an eye.
The major immortal sects of the Wu Nation have been completely defeated; some sects have joined the top ten sects of the Qian Nation; and some immortal sects of Wu continue to migrate and escape northward.
The various immortal cultivation resources of the Wu Nation have been divided among the top ten sects of the Qian Nation, including spiritual veins, spirit stone veins, and secret realms, all allocated based on military merits.
Five Elements Sect, because it followed the Purple Cloud Sect, got a big advantage, giving it a feeling of not thinking about returning.
Many Golden Core cultivators have not returned until now.
The current king of the Qian Nation has changed twice, and the initial intention was to launch a national attack on the Wu Nation, but it was stopped by the top ten sects.
Now, the people of Wu are displaced due to the great war between the two cultivation worlds. It is not suitable to launch a war temporarily. This is the source of countless disciples. They don't want the common people to harbor too much hatred.
As long as these generations pass through the years, the pursuit of immortality will make them forget everything, allowing Wu to be preserved.
In the Qian Nation, a scene of prosperity unfolded, and the entire country rejoiced together. Court officials continuously flattered the emperor, claiming him to be a reincarnated immortal, thus receiving the protection of the immortal sects.
Within the Five Elements Sect.
Ji Kun also returned but suffered a lifelong disability. His right arm was severed, and a chill entered his body.
To help him recover, a Golden Core cultivator needed to continuously nurture him, but the reality was cruel. He couldn't even enter the cave mansion of a Golden Core cultivator.
He contributed a lot during his time at the front lines, and his cultivation progressed to the mid-Foundation Building stage. Ji Kun, with only four elemental spirit roots, seemed to have reached his limit.
But he had no regrets after returning. Being able to contribute to his country and expand the territory for his sect was something worth being proud of throughout his life. His name deserved a place in the sect's genealogy!
After his return, Ji Kun's face changed significantly. The skinny, monkey-like face became filled with determination, but his eyes carried a sense of numbness.
Afterward, he spent three days and three nights talking to Chen Xun and the big black ox. He felt a sense of joy in his heart, and he let go of all his guards.
Chen Xun didn't express any opinions but silently listened, while the big black ox occasionally let out surprised cries.
After experiencing numerous life and death situations, Ji Kun had also become more open-minded. After all, war is the easiest way to change a person.
When he left, he said the same words as Shi Jing:
"Chen Junior Brother, Ox Junior Brother, fortunately, you both didn't go..."
It seemed that in the blink of an eye, the years had changed, and everyone's temperament had become indifferent after going through the ebb and flow of war, making them indifferent even to life and death.
This great war in the cultivation world finally came to an end.
Chen Xun felt neither sentimental nor particularly happy. Human joys and sorrows are not the same.
He and the big black ox observed everything around them like spectators. They even felt that picking up stones under the cliff would be more joyful.
Chen Xun hadn't touched or interacted with anyone, nor had he made any new friends. Chance encounters were the greatest beauty.
Today, the sky is clear with no clouds.
Chen Xun walked on the mountain path of the Five Elements Sect, leading the big black ox. He watched the disciples passing by, full of joy, and his gaze showed endless tranquility.
In the past century, they had sent away too many dead cultivatorsâ€”more than those they sent away in the mortal world.
The big black ox's merit ledger had no idea how many strokes were made, and sometimes it even forgot to eat.
"Cough."
Chen Xun coughed lightly and looked at the big black ox. "Old Ox..."
"Moo?"
"I feel a bit uneasy."
"Moo?" The big black ox looked puzzled and kept rubbing against Chen Xun.
Chen Xun found a stone by the road and sat down casually, looking at the distant peaks. The big black ox followed Chen Xun's line of sight.
"We are just ordinary people, with no lofty ideals or aspirations, and we don't have anything profound. Why live so plainly?"
Chen Xun picked up a small stone, threw it into the distance, and watched it fall with a clatter. Suddenly, he burst into laughter.
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox also laughed along, kicking a small stone down with its hoof.
The laughter of man and beast grew louder. They put their heads close together, enjoying this tiny moment of joy.
Surrounded by bamboo, with the sound of flowing springs, and looking into the distance, there were mountains beyond mountains and scenes beyond scenes, endless landscapes that captivated the soul.
"We are free."
"Moo moo!"
"Free!"
"Moo~~!!"
Suddenly, man and beast shouted loudly. Chen Xun spread his arms, and a gentle breeze came by. He laughed heartily.
