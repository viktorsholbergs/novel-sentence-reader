Mu Jiaoman sat in the huge empty carriage, enduring the countless jolts and shakes caused by the rough terrain in Mount Yue’s territory. The scene from the white jade platform was replaying endlessly in his mind.
Drawing back the curtain, Mu Jiaoman scanned the parched and cracked land with the scorching sun hanging in the sky.
“When was the last time it rained?” he asked loudly at the top of his voice.
“In four months, General!”
Mu Jiaoman pondered for a moment before he motioned for his subordinates.
"Withdraw the eastern defenses and drive the vagrants eastward, let them torment the strange people there,” he commanded.
One of his subordinates hesitated for a moment.
“But if we withdraw the eastern defense line and Li Xiangping escapes…” the subordinate’s voice trailed off, his tone filled with concern.
“That bastard is dead!” Mu Jiaoman roared, fury coursing through him.
With a violent motion, he grabbed the man by the neck fiercely with a scowl.
"How many times do I have to tell you?! That bastard is dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!” he screamed in anguish.
His eyes turned red from the anger and was just about to strike down on the man when he was stopped by his subordinates around him dropping to their knees.
“Greetings, Great King!” their voices crying out in unison.
Confused, Mu Jiaoman then slowly lifted his head to see Jianixi, who was looking down at him coldly.
Mu Jiaoman hurriedly flung the man aside and fell to his knees, pressing his forehead to the ground as color drained from his lips.
“Great King!” he stuttered.
Jianixi approached him, his gaze piercing and ferocious. Without a warning, he lashed out, delivering a strong kick to Mu Jiaoman’s body.
“Worthless!” he yelled angrily.
Mu Jiaoman was sent flying like a ball, crashing into several carriages. Rice and grain spilled onto the ground as he lay there, his men watching in fearful silence.
After tumbling a few times, Mu Jiaoman hurriedly scrambled back to his feet and slapped himself across the face.
Jianixi watched him for a moment before erupting into a scornful laugh.
“He was merely a cultivator of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, yet you and your men couldn’t even deal with him, and had to end up hiring a talisman shaman to kill him through a curse. You truly are a disappointment, Mu Jiaoman...” he sneered.
Mu Jiaoman numbly slapped himself as Jianixi’s voice echoed from above.
“You won’t be participating in the Great Sacrifice Ritual that’s happening in a few days. Use this time to stay in the camp and reflect on your actions.”
Mu Jiaoman snapped his head up suddenly, coming to a sudden realization.
But before he could speak, Jianixi struck him with a hard blow to his abdomen which immediately sent him into unconsciousness.
“Drag him away,” Jianixi ordered in a low voice as he watched Mu Jiaoman be hauled off to the camp.
Turning toward the towering Mount Wu,
“Live,” he murmured, his voice so soft it was barely audible.
After making a round in the mountain forest, Li Tongya rose from the desolate stronghold and pondered as the morning sun illuminated the sky.
“The absence of rising smoke in the east suggests that the Mount Yue Army has withdrawn… how could Mu Jiaoman allow Xiangping to return east so easily…?”
Swiftly traversing east, he noted the barren land beneath his feet, realizing it had been nearly half a year since the last rainfall.
“It’s no wonder there are so many Mount Yue vagrants.”
Li Tongya frowned, assessing the situation in Mount Yue’s territory and considering the likelihood of the stragglers crossing the border.
“The granaries of the Li Family have been abundant in recent years, capable of supporting a few thousand vagrants… however, a prolonged drought may deplete the Meiche River and threaten the food production…”
“The Ji Family’s letter also mentioned the sacrifice. I suspect Jianixi doesn’t have much time to spare…”
As Li Tongya ventured deeper into Mount Yue’s territory, he encountered increasingly parched land and trees that had no barks. In the distance, the imposing silhouette of the Great Jueting slowly emerged.
The lone city within Mount Yue bore the scars of time, its weather-beaten walls now showing signs of decay both inside and out.
At the edge of the city stood a towering altar made of soil, wood, and stone — its construction almost complete. It was rumored that Jianixi would be offering sacrifices to the heavens there, aiming to unite the world under a single cause.
Despite their weary appearance, the craftsmen laboring on the altar exuded hope and reverence, eagerly anticipating Jianixi to end the war and bring them stability.
“This is as far as I can go,” Li Tongya murmured to himself, coming to a halt. His search this time was as fruitless as his last. Deciding to turn back, he reluctantly retraced his steps toward Moongaze Lake.
Moongaze Lake had receded dramatically — its dry, cracked riverbed littered with the carcasses of dead fish and shrimp. The stench was so putrid and pungent that one could hardly keep their eyes open.
With jackals and vultures scavenging for food, the area looked no different than a desolate wasteland. Li Tongya only made one quick round around the lake before immediately making his way back to Mount Lijing.
Upon his return, Li Tongya was greeted by the sight of a massive black pig’s carcass sprawled in the courtyard. Its glossy fur still glistened in the sunlight and its tusks — long as an adult’s arm and as white as jade — protruded prominently.
Meanwhile, as Li Xuanling and Li Xuanxuan diligently performed the Spirit Sealing Technique on the pig’s joints and acupoints, Li Xuanfeng leaned against a huge rock and cleaned his bow.
“Second Uncle!” Li Xuanfeng exclaimed as he spotted Li Tongya’s descent.
With a bow in one hand and a hemp bag in the other, he pushed himself from the rock and straightened, his face beaming with excitement.
“This mountain pig demon is really huge, with strength at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm! It should provide a hearty addition to our meal!”
Li Tongya chuckled softly before inspecting the demon pig with his spiritual sense. He noticed a long, black, gleaming arrow embedded in its brain. It was the only mark of injury present in its otherwise pristine flesh.
“Just one shot?” he asked in surprise.
“Yep!” Li Xuanfeng confirmed proudly, his head held high. With one swift motion, he slung his long bow behind him and bent down, pulling out the long arrow from the pig demon’s empty eye socket.
He flung away the red and white matter that clung to it before continuing.
“I chased this pig demon the entire night! Finally at dawn, while it was gnawing on wood and bamboo, I shot an arrow that pierced its eye and its brain which killed it instantly!”
“Good job,” Li Tongya nodded approvingly as he heard this. However, he added a word of caution.
“Although this mountain pig demon may seem easy prey for your arrows, remember to stay cautious. Despite its swift demise by your hand, such creatures can still pose a threat. Be wary and hunt demons of the lower cultivation realm to hone your skills.”
Li Xuanfeng heeded Li Tongya’s caution, but a hint of defiance lingered in his expression.
“But this demon couldn’t even touch the hem of my shirt!” he said defensively.
Li Tongya chuckled and patted Li Xuanfeng’s shoulder affectionately, amused by his defiance.
“I know you’re skilled with your bow… in our family, only your youngest uncle’s swordsmanship could rival your talent. But you have to remember, the human body is vulnerable,” he emphasized once more, and his tone had a hint of gentleness.
As Li Tongya observed Li Xuanfeng’s serious demeanor, he decided to speak once more.
“Though cultivators at the Embryonic Breathing Realm possess strength akin to an ox, capable of feats like moving heavy objects and scaling walls, they remain far weaker than demonic creatures. I’ve faced many adversaries of the Qi Cultivator Realm, and do you know why those who lose often sustain serious injuries?” he added, an eyebrow raised.
“Is it due to the enemy’s spells?” Li Xuanfeng guessed, intrigued.
“Not entirely,” Li Tongya said as he shook his head.
“It’s because they fall.”
