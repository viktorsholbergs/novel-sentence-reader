Chapter 15: The Task Hall
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Since then, Lu Yang’s life has become quite fulfilling. In the early mornings, he would sit at the peak, bask in the morning light, practice his swordsmanship in the forenoon, rest on a tree at noon, spar with puppets in the afternoon, get beaten up, and after dinner, read late into the night, completing the assignments given by his Senior Sister.
A year passed, and Lu Yang’s cultivation steadily progressed.
…
“Look, isn’t that the fourth disciple of the Sect Leader, Lu Yang, the one with the Sword Spirit Root?”
Inside the Task Hall, Lu Yang, dressed in a white robe, with a spirited gaze and a sword with a red tassel on his waist, caught everyone’s eye.
Anyone would praise him as a young prodigy.
Most disciples of the Dao Seeking Sect were acquainted with each other, especially in places like the Task Hall where seeing an uncommon face always sparked additional interest.
Lu Yang, being the top candidate in the entrance examination, having the Sword Spirit Root, attracting the kind disposition of He Ling and Dai Bufan, and being under the Sect Leader’s tutelage, had become a shining star among the new generation of disciples. His fame was considerable, even surpassing Peach Blossom Leaf, known for her celestial beauty.
“Is that Lu Yang, personally trained by the Senior Sister? Oh, indeed it is.”
“I heard he has just recently become a Foundation Building cultivator after a year of joining the sect.”
“Foundation Building, huh? No wonder he’s come to the Task Hall. Seems like he’s ready to undertake tasks to hone his skills.”
Lu Yang was used to being stared at like a rare animal.
The discussions among the brothers were correct. Seven days ago, he successfully reached the Foundation Building stage. After spending another seven days consolidating his cultivation, he officially left seclusion, following Senior Sister’s instruction to get out and explore.
In the Task Hall, Lu Yang was amazed by the variety of tasks available, ranging from slaying powerful demons to helping find lost pets.
For instance, the task he was looking at required a dual cultivation technique, a legitimate one. Dual cultivation techniques come in two types: legitimate and illegitimate. The legitimate ones involve mutual assistance between a man and a woman, balancing Yin and Yang.
As for the illegitimate ones, no further explanation is needed.
The task was posted by a fox demon who had registered with the Dao Seeking Sect.
Although the sect’s duty includes subduing demons, they don’t blindly kill every demon. Those who are innocent and harbor no ill intentions towards humans are not only spared but also registered and granted legal status.
This fox demon, named Su Yan, was one such case.
The fox demon named Su Yan was originally a common little fox living deep in the mountains. She was caught in a hunter’s trap while playing, but fortunately, a disciple from a prestigious family happened to be playing in the mountains and rescued her, thwarting the hunter’s day of labor.
Later, Su Yan consumed a transformation fruit she found in a hidden cave, awakening the latent bloodline within her body and transforming into a fox demon.
Grateful and intent on repaying her debt, Su Yan assumed human form to express her gratitude to the noble family’s disciple.
The young master, now the head of his family, had seen many beautiful women but none compared to Su Yan.
Naturally, the two got married.
But then the problem arose.
Fox demons inherently have a seductive aura and uncontrollably absorb Yang energy. During intimate moments, the husband was always the one losing Yang energy.
Fortunately, Yang energy can be restored. After their marriage, the couple had to limit their intimate activities, which was not ideal for either of them. Frequent activities led to the husband’s increasingly frail condition, risking gossip.
To address this, Su Yan hoped to practice a legitimate dual cultivation technique to control her seductive fox nature. This task had been posted for quite a long time without any takers. It wasn’t that dual cultivation techniques were rare, but accepting the task implied possessing a legitimate technique, which inevitably led others to speculate about the existence of an illegitimate version. If fellow disciples asked for it, whether to admit having it and whether to share it became delicate questions. What would the sisters and brothers think?
“This task seems good, I’ll take it,” someone behind Lu Yang said. It was Meng Jingzhou, recognized by his voice. He was ideally suited for this task, given his family’s status and pure Yang spirit root, making it unlikely he possessed an illegitimate technique. Even if he did, there was nothing he could do with it.
Meng Jingzhou had become a Foundation Building cultivator earlier than Lu Yang and this was his third task. “You’ve reached the Foundation Building too?” Meng Jingzhou said with a smile. Both having rare spirit roots, their talents were not far apart. Lu Yang’s slightly later achievement in reaching Foundation Building was somewhat unexpected.
Remembering the year of hardship under his Senior Sister’s tutelage, Lu Yang sighed, “Finally, I have reached Foundation Building.”
“We should have a good meal once I finish this task. I’ll treat you,” Meng Jingzhou offered generously, with plenty of spirit stones to spare.
After Meng Jingzhou left, Lu Yang continued browsing the tasks posted on the wall.
“Evidence of demonic worship suspected in the north. Recommended for Golden Core cultivators and above to investigate. Task reward is 400 contribution points, with additional rewards for extra information uncovered.”
“Daoist Li Hong of Shanhaiguan has lost a pet and requires assistance in finding it.”
Lu Yang paused, thinking it was a good task as searching for cats and dogs posed no danger, but then he read on.
“Lost pet: a two-winged ferocious tiger with a Mid-Nascent Soul cultivation. Finder will receive 5,000 contribution points.”
Lu Yang shrank back. A Mid-Nascent Soul stage demonic beast, especially one with ancient bloodlines like the two-winged tiger, was way out of his league. He quickly moved on to the next task.
“Unusual spiritual energy fluctuations observed at Kunwu Mountain during the day-night transition. Suspected undiscovered cave heaven. Recommended for Late-Nascent Soul cultivators and above to investigate. Task reward is 8,000 contribution points, with additional rewards for valuable discoveries.”
Another irrelevant task for Lu Yang.
In the outside world, Qi Training cultivators could roam freely as martial artists, and Foundation Building cultivators could dominate small regions, enjoying prosperity for a century. Golden Core cultivators were esteemed enough to establish schools and be called real people.
However, in the Dao Seeking Sect, any random person could be at the Golden Core stage. Throwing a brick could hit a large number of them, and ordinary disciples would likely throw it back.
The Dao Seeking Sect’s disciples were all chosen from the best, and before the latest batch of new recruits, including Lu Yang, there were no Qi Training or Foundation Building disciples in the sect. The lowest cultivation level was Golden Core.
No matter how well one did outside, upon returning to the Dao Seeking Sect, one had to behave modestly.
Therefore, tasks suitable for Foundation Building cultivators were rare. Lu Yang reviewed several tasks, but most required Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivation.
He also noticed a special task.
“Long-term task: Collect unrecorded techniques of the Dao Seeking Sect. Rewards depend on the content of the technique.”
“Note: Senior Sister Yun Zhi, please do not accept this task. A Yun Zhi section has been established in the Scripture Pavilion for her to directly place her written techniques.”
