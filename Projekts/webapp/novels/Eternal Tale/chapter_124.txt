Chen Xun and the big black ox also headed towards the central city area, bustling and lively everywhere. Chen Xun saw many disciples from various sects.
The big black ox looked around with hope in its eyes, if only... only if they could see a few familiar faces.
They didn't communicate with each other. They walked and looked around, traversing wide streets and brushing past countless cultivators.
In places with more cultivators, if there's no specific target, it's best not to grab anyone’s attention on purpose. It's an extremely serious provocation unless you're really someone big, unafraid of the crowd's anger.
"Old ox, let's go with the flow. They should all have advanced. In the cultivation world, whose aptitude isn't better than ours, hehe."
"Moo moo~"
"I haven't opened that ancient book of mine yet. I'm just thinking that next time we meet, I'll give him a huge surprise and then give it back to him!"
"Moo!"
"By then, we'll say, yes, we are the legendary, terrifying old monsters. Younger generations tremble, hahaha..."
"Moo moo~~"
The big black ox also laughed, but suddenly looked towards Chen Xun with a hint of doubt in its eyes. If Chen Xun really wanted to, he could quietly return to the Five Elements Sect.
Chen Xun's heart sank; he patted its head and changed the subject: "Oh my, look at that auction hall, old ox!"
"Moo?" The big black ox instantly stopped thinking about it, and its gaze was drawn away.
They stood at a corner of the street, the central city area was still a bit far from here, but they could already see the open auction hall.
It was named Taigu Hall, a quite ancient hall renowned in the cultivation world. It's said to have stood here since the city was built, jointly managed and protected by the Top Ten Sects, never touched by outsiders.
Such ancient heritage couldn't be compared to ordinary refining items. Even from a distance, it would make people feel respectful and immerse themselves in the changes in the cultivation world over the years.
The Taigu Hall was overall black and gold, with a grand and rigorous layout, towering as high as the city wall and overlooking the visitors from all directions.
Normally, the Taigu Hall was not open at all, enveloped by a great formation, and only now was it truly revealed to the public.
Chen Xun swallowed a mouthful of saliva; his eyes widened, and so did the big black ox’s.
They silently exchanged glances, both having the same thought: Can cultivators really build such structures?!
"Old ox, let's go closer to take a look. Otherwise, it'll be a huge regret."
"Moo!"
With shock in their eyes, they walked while looking up at the Taigu Hall in the distance. They both enjoyed observing the city's walls and buildings.
They always felt that there were countless stories and wisdom hidden inside; perhaps only they could calm down enough to do such a life-wasting thing in the entire cultivation world.
The central city area was quite spacious, with almost no streets. Pavilions and towers stood in all directions; even the restaurants and inns had their own gathering formations, which were extremely luxurious.
Most restaurants had observation decks, and many people with imposing auras sat there looking down at the ground, with sharp eyes and many servants around them.
To the north of the Taigu Hall were the various fighting arenas, where the geniuses of various forces and sects were ready to show up. Some hidden geniuses were also preparing to make a stunning appearance at the event, astonishing everyone.
The surrounding area was bustling with people, but with restrictions on setting up stalls, disciples from the ten major sects were stationed everywhere, and there were even Golden Core Stage cultivators.
To the west of the Taigu Hall was the site of the Flower Festival. Flowers were blooming all over the west of the city, with a river flowing through it, completely different from the Tian Duan Great Plain, very strange.
"This Kong Yongyuan senior is a bit too arrogant."
"This person is only at the mid Golden Core stage, yet dares to claim invincibility in the same realm? I don't quite understand."
"Have you all forgotten about Yudong, the young master of Moyu Pavilion?"
"Yudong is also a possessor of celestial spiritual roots. It's said that he was taught by a certain old ancestor outside of Qian Nation. It seems that this event will be another intense battle."
There were discussions everywhere in the central city area, with the focus always on those geniuses. Chen Xun and the big black ox sat in a corner of the city, silently watching the grand hall.
They originally wanted to go and take a look, but the surroundings of the Taigu Hall were guarded by disciples from various sects, so they had to give up.
"Old ox, we still lack two spiritual herbs. Let's also participate in the auction."
"Moo~"
"But this auction is so mysterious, they haven't even released an auction list in advance." Chen Xun sighed deeply, his gaze still fixed on the Taigu Hall. "The entrance fee is just a thousand low-grade spirit stones..."
"Moo~" The big black ox also sighed, placing its hoof on Chen Xun's shoulder, and comforting him.
"Old ox, it's okay. Spirit stones can be earned again. Am I someone who lacks spirit stones?" Chen Xun's eyes showed no concern, but he subconsciously pinched his storage pouch, as if worried it might sprout legs and run away.
"Moo!"
The big black ox snorted heavily, nodding vigorously. With tens of thousands of low-grade spirit stones, they must be careful not to be taken advantage of.
They stopped chattering, leaning on each other's shoulders as they looked at the Taigu Hall. The more they looked, the more interesting it became.
As days passed by, the entire Yuxu City gradually became turbulent, with movement from all sides. The atmosphere in the central city area was tense.
Everywhere were the so-called geniuses of the cultivation world, walking with pride and arrogance, with sharp edges revealed, and surrounded by a large group of people.
Now Chen Xun and the big black ox had to walk slower, their breathing evened out a lot, to avoid bumping into any big shots, getting directly mocked by them, and then pulled onto the fighting stage.
They were afraid that if they lost control and accidentally killed these geniuses, it would be embarrassing...
Outside the Taigu Hall, there were powerful formations and crowds of cultivators. They were passing through the array of restrictions to enter the venue. The auction was divided into two parts.
The side hall was for Qi Refining Stage cultivators and Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators. Their level had a separate area, and the entrance fee was only 300 low-grade spirit stones.
The main hall was for Golden Core Stage cultivators and the old ancestors of Nascent Soul Stage. It was the peak of real power from various countries, and the entrance fee was 1000 low-grade spirit stones.
Chen Xun had transformed again and became a Golden Core Stage cultivator, but the big black ox was still at the Foundation Establishment Stage.
They had inquired and found out that spirit beasts accompanying cultivators didn't need to pay much for admission, which was quite considerate.
Outside the main hall, Foundation Establishment Stage disciples from the ten major sects were constantly greeting their predecessors, while the old ancestors of Nascent Soul Stage had already entered from another entrance.
Looking around, there were probably hundreds of Golden Core Stage cultivators at a glance, which was quite terrifying.
"Senior, are you here to participate in the grand auction?" A woman in purple approached enthusiastically, seeing Chen Xun standing outside for a while.
"Yes, I wonder what the rules are." Chen Xun nodded and smiled, scanning the surroundings again.
Even the big black ox dared not look around now, its tail hanging down, staring blankly at the purple-dressed woman.
"Senior is a Golden Core Stage cultivator. You only need to pay a thousand spirit stones to enter, without any additional rules."
"Okay, here are the spirit stones."
Chen Xun waved and took out the spirit stones from his storage pouch. The woman in purple also took out a storage ring and accepted them, giving Chen Xun a jade token.
"Senior, this is your room restriction token, with the sequence number 357."
"Oh? Indeed, worthy of the Top Ten Sects." Chen Xun's eyes brightened, and he hurriedly took it. "Thank you very much."
The woman in purple smiled sweetly and extended her hand. "This is what a junior should do. Senior, please enter the hall."
Chen Xun patted the big black ox, and they injected a bit of spiritual energy into the jade token, instantly entering the array barrier.
Now, they were able to observe the Taigu Hall up close, and they were once again shocked. But there were too many cultivators around, so they didn't linger too long.
Inside the Taigu Hall, it was quite spacious, like the ancient Roman Colosseum, but all the rooms on the observation platform were shielded from spiritual sense.
Chen Xun took a cursory glance and estimated that even with all kinds of rooms, it could accommodate tens of thousands of people, which was really absurdly large.
Golden Core Stage cultivators kept entering the main hall one after another, silent, but the old ancestors of Nascent Soul Stage were nowhere to be seen.
"Old ox, I guess those Nascent Soul Stage old ancestors are in the topmost rooms."
Chen Xun raised his head and looked at the rooms at the top of the observation platform. They looked like towering structures and were quite oppressive.
"Moo~" The big black ox looked a little nervous. These were the legendary big shots, even more powerful than the great masters of Panning City.
"Old ox, let's go to our room first."
"Moo~"
Inside the main hall, there were steps everywhere, and they could go up anywhere. Following the sequence number on the jade token, Chen Xun finally found their position in the center of the observation platform.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood there again, looking down with a hint of excitement in their eyes. They had truly broadened their horizons, and a thousand spirit stones didn't seem like such a loss.
As soon as the restriction outside the room touched the jade token, a gap opened, and Chen Xun and the big black ox jumped in...
