A month later, Chen Xun and the big black ox found themselves in an unnamed mountain range, looking dejected and devoid of any other thoughts.
Following the map of the Qian Nation, they had passed through a dozen cities and several cultivator markets along the way.
Despite their efforts, they hadn’t encountered any evil cultivators robbing or harming innocent mortals. Instead, they saw many Qi Refining cultivators living arrogantly and extravagantly in the cities—matters beyond their concern.
They hadn’t come across any Foundation Establishment cultivators using mortal flesh and blood to break through to the Golden Core stage either. Let alone encountering some absurd event like a master destroying a city with a wave of their hand—there wasn’t even a hint of such news.
Occasionally, they saw cultivators fighting outside the markets, but those were personal grievances, which they also didn’t intervene in.
Chen Xun couldn’t just arbitrarily label strong individuals as guilty and act like a righteous hero of the cultivation world.
“Old Ox…”
“Moo~”
“I hereby declare the plan to fight the strong and help the weak temporarily suspended.” Chen Xun cursed, holding a broad axe in his hand, “Let's focus on cultivation and improving our skills, leaving all distractions behind.”
“Moo~” The big black ox, feeling down, placed a hoof on Chen Xun’s shoulder to comfort him.
“Damn it… Don’t worry, Old Ox. If we don’t find anything in Qian Nation, we’ll find it elsewhere.” Chen Xun placed a hand on the big black ox’s head, “Let’s cultivate well first and take whatever we can get without rushing.”
“Moo~!” The big black ox snorted heavily, filled with motivation.
With the resources they had, they were just one step away from the Nascent Soul stage! Following the proper steps, there was no need to worry.
“Old Ox, let’s go scout around some more.”
“Moo~”
They traversed the mountain paths, surrounded by peaks of various shapes, mysterious and awe-inspiring. This mountain range still lacked spiritual energy, occasionally populated by wild beasts, with hunters sometimes seen settling on the outskirts.
They ventured deeper into the mountains, using the wild beasts they encountered as extra meals.
Half a month later, in an unremarkable dense forest, Chen Xun and the big black ox unleashed their spiritual senses, their sharp eyes scanning the surroundings. Soon, the ground began to turn into a swamp.
“Old Ox, dig, let’s create our underground world.”
“Moo moo~~!”
Their formidable power surged out, five thick magic chains circling them as they started to quietly sink, preparing for underground cultivation.
Chen Xun and the big black ox’s cultivation method was entirely different from that of ordinary cultivators; the world’s spiritual energy was already useless to them.
Progressing in their cultivation was even more challenging than for Qi Refining cultivators, almost unbearably slow.
**Rumble…**
The sound of muffled thunder echoed from underground as they sank continuously, the ground returning to its original state without any trace.
Their protective magical shield fully activated, the surrounding soil and rocks pressed in, bringing a sense of compression, enveloped in darkness and depth.
“Wow, Old Ox, this feels so peculiar.” Chen Xun, full of amazement, communicated telepathically, “Can you handle it?”
“Moo moo~~” The big black ox widened its eyes, looking at the pressing soil around them as they continued to sink.
“Hahaha, in a place like this, even ghosts wouldn’t find us.” Chen Xun laughed heartily, feeling the increasing pressure but remaining unaffected, “Old Ox, how’s my idea?”
“Moo!” The big black ox exclaimed, looking at Chen Xun with admiration, indeed worthy of being the boss.
“This is much safer than any cave or underground hole. Though there’s no spiritual energy, there’s still the essence of the five elements.” Chen Xun chuckled, his mind brimming with wisdom, “Stop when it feels about right, otherwise we won’t be able to withstand the earth’s pressure.”
“Moo~” The big black ox grinned, their defenses were incredibly strong, feeling no pressure at all now.
**Rumble…**
Their descent quickened, the air growing thinner, and Chen Xun continuously felt the surrounding pressure.
Their Five Elements Golden Core, everlasting, allowed them to fast without food and generate their own internal circulation, needing no breath, unlike ordinary Golden Core cultivators.
Combining various conditions, Chen Xun dared to make such a plan; otherwise, they would have had to honestly dig a cave.
Three days and nights later, the heaviness of the earth was already making them uncomfortable, so they ascended a bit until they felt comfortable before stopping.
"Old Ox, set up the formation." Chen Xun shouted, his spiritual energy surging, a rainbow light flashing, continuously crushing the surrounding soil and rocks, "I'll dig the earth cave, and you guard me."
"Moo!"
The big black ox roared, opening its mouth wide, and from its storage ring emerged rows of formation flags, formation disks, and various formation materials.
It sat within a protective magic shield, continuously waving its hooves, following the path Chen Xun was clearing.
**Buzz…**
The surrounding five-colored spiritual energy stabilized the area, and the Five Elements Formation roared to life, securing the earth cave. The underground was still rich with the essence of the five elements, even more so than spiritual energy.
Chen Xun and the big black ox also greatly preferred the essence of the five elements. Spiritual energy had too many limitations and was quite scarce compared to this convenience.
With another wave of the big black ox's hoof, hundreds of mid-grade spirit stones embedded themselves into the key points of the formation, ready for use when needed.
The man and ox worked seamlessly together, and a spacious and massive earth cave gradually took shape and solidified.
"Old Ox, damn it, let's do this!" Chen Xun's eyes sparkled with excitement as he continued to compress the surrounding area, "If our power had this effect during the Qi Refining stage, we wouldn't have needed any spells."
"Moo!!"
The big black ox called out excitedly, following closely behind Chen Xun, and the area covered by the formation expanded continuously.
The rumbling undergrounf didn’t cease for half a day. But they were so far from the surface that no one could guess that two mid-stage Golden Core cultivators were having a field day underground.
This behavior was entirely outrageous, subverting the common understanding of the cultivation world. Any normal-minded cultivator would never have thought of this.
But it was indeed extremely safe.
Their underground earth cave was developed to the standards of a cave dwelling, mimicking its design, though it was a bit rough.
"Old Ox, how is it?" Chen Xun's mouth curved into a grin as he looked around. It was quite spacious, dark, and quiet.
Inside the huge earth cave, alchemy rooms, tool refinement rooms, spirit beast rooms, and seclusion rooms were all created.
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox ran to Chen Xun's side. The surroundings were completely stabilized by the formation, impervious to water and fire, and could absorb the surrounding essence of the five elements for circulation.
Chen Xun slowly landed, looking around with some emotion. They had learned so much along the way.
"Old Ox, let’s get to work, plant trees, and cultivate spiritual herbs.” He started to give orders, "Use the wood of the crane spirit trees as fuel, otherwise, the light in the cave will consume too much power."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded. They had already planned this out during their journey and then started running around.
Chen Xun also calmed himself and entered the alchemy room, preparing to refine True Essence Pills.
An ice-blue alchemy furnace stood on the ground, surrounded by low-grade spirit stones for restoring spiritual energy. His eyes deepened, and instead of immediately starting the furnace, he calculated the time with his fingers.
Time, though insensitive to immortals, carried a unique sensitivity.
"Not much time left…"
In the darkness, a soft sigh echoed. Chen Xun gradually closed his eyes, and one by one, alchemical flames ignited in the air, emitting a terrifying, eerie light.
The big black ox continued to busy itself, running back and forth. Chen Xun refined pills daily, producing five bottles of mid-grade Five Elements Pills and placing them in his storage ring.
The big black ox sat beside the spiritual herbs and spirit trees daily, watching the crane spirit trees grow sturdily and the jade source fruit trees gradually mature. They also relaxed and discussed their future Nascent Soul plans daily, feeling very fulfilled.
Days passed like this, with the outside world constantly changing, but nothing affected them.
