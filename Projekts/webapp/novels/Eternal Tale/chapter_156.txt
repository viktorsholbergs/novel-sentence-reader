Jiao Gu Market is a medium-sized place for cultivators to interact, managed by a small sect.
Nowadays, it has become quite desolate. Many shops have closed down, and only a few scattered cultivators still conduct business there.
Outside Jiao Gu Market, two figures wearing straw hats appeared, their eyes filled with confusion.
"Old Ox, is it just my illusion?" Chen Xun extended his spiritual sense, scanning the area. "This place is in ruins? Why are there so little cultivators?"
"Moo?" The big black ox sniffed the air, also puzzled. Something felt very wrong.
"Could it be the work of demonic cultivators?!" Chen Xun's eyes lit up, instinctively gripping his mountain-splitting axe. "We must take action."
"Moo!" The big black ox widened its eyes and nodded heavily, considering it a strong possibility.
At this moment, a Qi Refining stage cultivator emerged from the market, looking worried.
"Brother!" Chen Xun laughed heartily and quickly ran over to stop him, with the big black ox surrounding him from behind.
The cultivator was startled, his eyes filled with vigilance. He was a Qi Refining stage level ten expert with a spirit beast helping him.
Now, he found himself surrounded. He secretly reached for his talisman, sensing that these newcomers were not friendly.
"Don't misunderstand, we're good people." Chen Xun smiled brightly, ‘accidentally’ dropping two low-grade spirit stones into his hand. "We just want to ask a few questions."
He no longer avoided people intentionally, starting to face everything with optimism, just like he did in the mortal world.
Ah, a cooperative fellow!
The cultivator's eyes brightened, and he discreetly put away the spirit stones, smiling with delight. "There's no need for such courtesy, fellow Daoist. Ask whatever you want to know."
"Why is Jiao Gu Market so desolate? Is it because of a demonic cultivator invasion?" Chen Xun was full of thoughts, and the mountain-opening axe at his waist was almost impossible to hold back. "I am a disciple of a sect, and it is my duty to uphold justice for cultivators."
"Moo~" The big black ox roared angrily from behind, indicating its agreement.
The cultivator was baffled and cupped his hands in explanation. "Does your sect not know that the Top Ten Sects of the Qian Nation issued a decree to explore the northern regions of Wu Nation?"
"Huh?" Chen Xun was greatly disappointed, and his eyes showed surprise. "Is that really true? They've all left?"
"Yes, indeed. “He shook his head and sighed. "I heard that many sects have sent large numbers of disciples, leaving the Qian Nation's cultivation world desolate. Many capable rogue cultivators have also gone. I heard that the three major forces outside the Qian Nation have also gone…Probably only us weaker vagabond cultivators are still here." He sighed and shook his head. This was indeed a grand event in the cultivation world. "I truly envy those seniors."
"I see. Thank you for clearing this up." Chen Xun cupped his hands, still looking surprised. "We won't disturb you any further."
"Farewell, fellow Daoist." The cultivator laughed, much less worried, having gained two low-grade spirit stones.
**_Damn._**
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged a meaningful glance. Their emergence seemed to coincide with a major change in the cultivation world.
"Heh heh." Chen Xun suddenly let out a strange laugh. "Old Ox, this makes our plan even more feasible."
"Moo?" The big black ox's eyes rolled as it pondered. "Moo moo!!"
**Swish.**
A map spread out in the air. Chen Xun and the big black ox passed the market and started heading east, gathering information along the way.
Six months later, at the eastern border of the Qian Nation.
The sky was filled with yellow, and the great wall stretched for miles with a majestic aura. Soldiers stood atop the city walls on patrol, their weapons gleaming coldly, and military flags fluttering in the wind.
Their eyes were sharp, constantly scanning the surroundings to fend off foreign invaders.
The eastern region had many small countries, and foreign invaders would occasionally come to plunder the border towns, only to be killed mercilessly, their corpses displayed on the city walls for three days.
Though the cultivation world was desolate, the mortal realm was thriving, with the two realms not interfering with each other. The border town was bustling with activity. The streets were filled with shouts from vendors, and from time to time, citizens carrying their wares would pass by, along with merchant caravans from distant places.
"Young man, come again next time."
"Definitely!"
An old man at a fruit stall smiled broadly as he bade farewell to a customer who had bought a large amount of fruit.
"Old Ox, is it tasty?" Chen Xun held two pieces of fruit, juice dripping from his mouth, while he fed the big black ox.
"Moo!" The big black ox responded perfunctorily, eating two pieces at a time. It was indeed delicious.
"I didn’t expect it to be true. More than half of the sects have gone exploring." Chen Xun talked while eating, his cheeks puffed out. "I heard it's quite dangerous, with Nascent Soul elders overseeing it. We better not join the fray."
"Moo~" The big black ox, who was more interested in the fruit, was too preoccupied to talk.
They walked down the street, thoughts racing as their eyes wandered curiously at everything.
"Those three major powers also rose from the many small countries in the east. I heard it's quite chaotic there, with even cultivators becoming emperors." Chen Xun shook his head with a bitter smile and suddenly slapped the big black ox, which hadn’t been paying attention to him. "Old Ox!"
"Moo!" The big black ox yelped, dropping half a fruit, which it quickly picked up with its tongue.
Chen Xun stopped feeding it, and the big black ox looked at him eagerly, ready to listen seriously.
"Such a chaotic place is our opportunity. It's much safer than staying in the Qian Nation."
"Moo?"
"The Top Ten Sects surely have Nascent Soul elders guarding them. We shouldn’t go there and risk our lives; they’ve blocked all our paths." Chen Xun sneered at their ruthlessness. "There's no chance for us."
"Moo~~" The big black ox nodded thoughtfully.
"We’ve heard in Yuxu City that those three major powers are wealthier than any one of the Top Ten Sects."
"Moo~"
"So, the cultivation rules there are not as strict as here. Those three major powers don’t have the strength to block all paths like the Top Ten Sects." Chen Xun spoke eloquently. Despite not having high cultural knowledge, his extensive travels had given him some insights. "Although the risks are higher, the rewards will be much greater."
"Moo~~~!" The big black ox snorted, knowing that with their current strength, escaping wouldn't be a problem.
Chen Xun acknowledged the risks, which primarily involved facing Nascent Soul cultivators, but how likely was that?
"We can't force our way into the Top Ten Sects; they are all in cahoots. The north is also not an option. The east is our only opportunity." Chen Xun chuckled, having formulated this plan back in Yuxu City. "With all the cultivators exploring the north, we should head east."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox looked delighted, happy to avoid fighting over resources with others.
Chen Xun leapt onto the big black ox's back, sat cross-legged, and slowly put on his straw hat. "Old Ox, let's set out and find our own path abroad."
"Moo!!" The big black ox roared, taking a gentle step forward, causing a slight whirlwind of dust, and instantly disappeared from the border town.
The surrounding citizens stared wide-eyed in disbelief. Where had the living black ox on the street just gone?!
The town buzzed with excitement. Some claimed to have seen an illusion, while others speculated it might have been a visit from immortals, eventually becoming a topic of casual conversation.
The border town remained lively, the mortal world continued to thrive, and the northern region of Wu Nation saw an increasing number of cultivators gathering. Every day, the sky echoed with the sounds of cultivators arriving.
Meanwhile, two immortals, forging their own path, ventured beyond the Qian Nation, heading east to the various countries.
