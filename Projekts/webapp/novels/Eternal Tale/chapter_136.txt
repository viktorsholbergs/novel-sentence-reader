"Old Ox, stop dawdling, we still haven't seen the spiritual herbs we need, hurry up and look."
"Moo!"
Startled, the big black ox realized, yes, their main purpose was to buy spiritual herbs, almost forgot.
The matter of the array diagram was immediately pushed aside by them, and they picked up the booklet again to keep watch.
But the results were still unsatisfactory. Although there were other spiritual herbs, they still didn't find what they were looking for.
As the final item came up, they quietly left. They had no greed for such things; those were not things they could afford to touch.
Being able to acquire the Five Elements Array diagram already satisfied them.
On the way home, amidst the bustling crowd, Chen Xun and the big black ox walked far away, trying to take less crowded routes.
"Old Ox, I'm already considering the next hundred-year plan."
"Moo?"
"This cultivation really takes time. Sometimes, when you're practicing, you don't even notice time passing." Chen Xun sighed lightly, as if reading a book. When he started reading, it was with the leisure of floating clouds, but when he finished, the sky was full of stars.
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded as well. It couldn't be imagined how those great cultivators cultivated so quickly.
After establishing the Foundation, reaching the Golden Core stage, their lifespans simply weren't enough. It had once thought that if it didn't have immortality, it would probably cultivate to the Foundation Establishment stage and then go plow fields with Chen Xun, abandoning cultivation thereafter!
A life of more than three hundred years would still be exciting, but in the cultivation world, it would just be running from dogs, constantly cultivating, not understanding the meaning of life.
The big, black ox's eyes revealed wisdom. The more it thought about it, the more reasonable it seemed. The Golden Core realm made its brain smarter.
"Old Ox, what are you thinking about?" Chen Xun smirked, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. "Don't worry, I've got it all figured out."
"Moo?"
"It's about that..."
"Moo?"
"Ah."
"Let me thank you sincerely..."
Chen Xun said it seriously, lifting the ox's ear.
"Moo!!!"
The big black ox's scalp tingled, emitting a roar-like cry of surprise. It figured out that Chen Xun wanted to sing!!
Subconsciously, it kicked its hind hoof, and coincidentally, it hit Chen Xun right in the abdomen.
The latter's face changed drastically. Holding his stomach with one hand, he fell to his knees, his expression increasingly painful, as if he were on the verge of death.
The big black ox panicked, circling around frantically. How could it have kicked Chen Xun so badly again?
Passing cultivators pointed and whispered, with a hint of regret in their eyes.
"Has this Daoist friend been injured by his own spiritual beast?"
"I don't think so. This person is clutching his stomach, and his face seems pained, like he's heartbroken."
"Oh? I didn't expect this Daoist friend to have such abilitiesâ€”to see through things with just a glance?"
"I'm known as the Fate Reader. I can predict the future and know fortune and misfortune."
"What?! It's actually the Fate Reader!"
"Hehe, indeed, it is. It's a coincidence that we've met. Today, I'll cast three divinations, and the spiritual stones will be given according to fate."
Suddenly, the Fate Reader beside Chen Xun set up his stall, and many cultivators gathered around, showing great interest.
Damn it!
Chen Xun's stomach suddenly didn't hurt anymore. He stood up suddenly, his gaze shocked as he looked at the fortune-teller. Could he still play like this?!
"Moo?"
"Wasn't it me who got injured?"
"Moo?"
"Let's go, old ox; let's go home."
"Moo?"
"He's pretending."
Chen Xun laughed heartily, grabbing the ox's head and walking away. The big black ox still looked puzzled, not looking like he was pretending.
The fortune-teller's stall behind them was still bustling, but it seemed to have long exceeded three divinations.
In the Qin Immortal Mountain Cave, the big black ox went to take care of the spiritual herbs again, while Chen Xun sat by the stream, starting to plan.
"Spiritual herbs won't wait specifically for us. If we don't find them this time, we'll have to wait for the next hundred years." Chen Xun pondered, looking into the distance. "We have at most six hundred years left. We can't stay in this cave anymore."
He lowered his gaze and began to write quickly and with determination. There was still plenty of time, and they could still do many meaningful things.
If there was still no news of the spiritual herbs after six hundred years, they would have to move to Tian Duan Plains and visit Yuxu City every hundred years.
Chen Xun had already started planning for six hundred years later, with paths for both advancement and retreat. These days had to be spent prosperously.
But for the next hundred years, he didn't plan to sell spiritual herbs and elixirs every month anymore. Over time, it would attract too much attention, and besides, they already had enough spiritual stones.
The main plan was still focused on refining mana and enhancing his own magic weapon. Without strength, how could one protect the path to longevity?
Days passed by, and another April came to an end.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were always busy, living a fulfilling life. They rushed down the mountain to attend the final auction.
"Old Ox, let's go; we're bound to find some big gains this time!"
"Moo moo!!"
"Hahaha."
Chen Xun and the big black ox raced through the mountain trails, not even needing any fancy footwork. Even their straw hats behind them kept flying off, they were so joyful.
Occasionally, passing cultivators would see them and fall into contemplation.
Tai Gu Palace.
They arrived as scheduled, full of ambition and courage. Once again, they stepped into the hall.
One day and one night later.
Two figures returned in defeat, leaving early with gloomy faces. After missing out on a spiritual herb due to cultivation last time, they hadn't encountered one since.
Chen Xun panted heavily, looking back with anger.
"Damn it, Tai Gu Palace, we'll meet again in a hundred years! Next time, we'll be back!"
"Moo~~!"
The big black ox snorted heavily, standing up in anger. Tai Gu Palace hadn't given them any face.
"Old Ox, let's go!"
"Moo!"
The two figures turned and headed home in anger without buying anything, losing another thousand spiritual stones for nothing.
However, as they passed by the Ink Feather Pavilion shop, Chen Xun suddenly stopped. This shop was so spacious, it seemed to cover an area of half a square mile. It was also seven stories tall, with continuous greetings inside and a steady stream of cultivators coming and going, especially on the first floor, where most people gathered.
The big black ox looked up at Chen Xun.
"Old Ox, let's spend some money. Do you already know the materials for the array diagram?"
"Moo~"
The big black ox kept tossing its head. It had been looking at that array diagram every day and even thought about modifying it itself. What belonged to others was always theirs.
"Let's spend it." Chen Xun folded his hands behind his back, his gaze slightly focused.
"Moo!"
The big black ox followed Chen Xun directly into the shop, first scanning through the first floor to see if there were any bargains.
Chen Xun, revealing his Golden Core cultivation base, went straight to the second floor, where he was immediately greeted by two Foundation Establishment cultivators.
Their enthusiastic appearance made Chen Xun speechless. They almost asked him if he wanted to apply for a credit card, subtly hinting at additional special services.
This Ink Feather Pavilion's business style deserved all the spiritual stones it earned!
"Hehehe..."
Chen Xun felt quite comfortable being flattered like this, but when they tried to make him spend freely, he immediately changed his attitude, carefully selecting and bargaining.
In the end, the two Foundation Establishment cultivators were helpless. Even a Golden Core cultivator came out from inside the pavilion. Little did they know that Chen Xun would soon engage them in a verbal battle.
"Friend, this Crystal is extremely difficult to condense under very harsh conditions, and its effects are endless. Twenty thousand low-grade spiritual stones per ounce, and I guarantee it."
"When I went to the auction, this thing was not suitable for the occasion." Chen Xun shook his head indifferently, showing no desire to buy. "I've inquired about this item before in different pavilions..."
"Please wait, friend."
The Golden Core cultivator's pupils slightly widened. This person's knowledge was not small; he had compared so many shops. "But the price is determined by the pavilion."
