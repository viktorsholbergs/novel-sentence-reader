"I dare not forget." Li Tongya nodded.
Xiao Yuansi placed his tea bowl down, saying warmly, "Our two families should establish a marriage alliance and support each other…Does the Li Family currently have any unmarried direct descendants?"
"Indeed, we do," Li Tongya replied respectfully and used his mana to send a voice transmission to Li Xuanxuan.
"Bring up all of the Yuan and Qing generation… except for Qinghong and Yuanyun."
Li Xuanxuan hurried off to make the arrangements while Xiao Yuansi studied Li Tongya carefully and said with a smile, "If I'm not mistaken, you have established your immortal foundation through the River One Qi Technique, which we traded with your family. It should be called Boundless Ocean."
"That's right," Li Tongya replied, cupping his fist.
Xiao Yuansi became serious and said, "Achieving one's immortal foundation is significant. Since you have succeeded, I should give you some advice."
"Please do, Senior!"
Seeing Li Tongya respond earnestly, Xiao Yuansi sipped his tea and said softly, "Boundless Ocean and our Man On Creek share the same origin, these two immortal foundations are closely related. If you encounter a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator with either immortal foundation, be extremely careful!"
Li Tongya looked up, immediately thought of something and asked, "Are there any taboos?"
Xiao Yuansi nodded and continued, "Boundless Ocean and Man On Creek are types of immortal foundations that the ancient Daoists called Dao Partners… Demonic and devil cultivators refer to them as Shared Pills. Such immortal foundations have many connections and can complement each other, however, If you meet someone with impure intentions, they are likely to…"
Xiao Yuansi paused, struggling to find the right words.
"They might… dig out your own immortal foundation and consume it to supplement theirs," he finished his sentence.
"Consume..?"
Li Tongya was silent for a moment before asking quietly, "Senior, how common is this practice?"
"Not common," Xiao Yuansi replied as he shook his head and explained, "First, this method is risky and may cause madness. Moreover, it is hard to find Dao Partners… Consuming them requires considerable skill in alchemy. Second, although it greatly enhances one's cultivation and makes the immortal foundation more marvelous, the person will be stuck at Foundation Establishment Realm and will not be able to advance to the Purple Mansion Realm. Only those who have no hope of breaking through and are desperate might attempt such a feat."
Li Tongya sighed softly and asked Xiao Yuansi, "Senior, which types of immortal foundations are considered Dao Partners of Boundless Ocean?"
Xiao Yuansi folded his sleeves and replied, "The first is Darkening Clouds, the second is Boundless Ocean, the third is Man On Creek, the fourth is Holding the Ridge, and the fifth is Grieving River Departure."
Seeing Li Tongya carefully noting them down, Xiao Yuansi transmitted more information to him with mana.
"These immortal foundations are also coveted by Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. However, to claim an immortal foundation, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator must first carefully cultivate and implant a Dao seed starting from Qi Cultivation Realm… We do not need to worry about that."
"I understand, Senior," Li Tongya nodded, finally realizing why Chejing had been targeted by the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of the Azure Pond Sect. He sighed softly and smiled bitterly. "A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator may improve their cultivation by stealing an immortal foundation, but they struggle to advance to Purple Mansion Realm… There must also be hidden consequences for Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who take one!"
Xiao Yuansi nodded curtly and became more cautious in discussing the topic, speaking in a low voice, "With proper preparation, Purple Mansion Realm cultivators can gain significant power by taking an immortal foundation. Although it is not as perfect as one cultivated by oneself, it drastically shortens their cultivation time. Naturally, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators seek it eagerly…"
While they were whispering, Li Xuanxuan arrived with the others. Li Yuanjiao held Li Qingxiao's hand while Li Xuanxuan's wife followed with Li Yuanping in her arms.
Li Tongya smiled, "These are the juniors of the Yuan and Qing generation in our family. Please take a look, Senior."
The two children looked nervously at Xiao Yuansi. Li Yuanjiao stepped forward and said respectfully, "Greetings from Junior Li Yuanjiao, Senior!"
Xiao Yuansi glanced over them, focusing on Li Yuanjiao, who at just seventeen or eighteen had already reached the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He nodded.
"Li Yuanjiao… that's a good name."
Li Tongya added, "There was originally another eldest child, but he was assassinated by the Yu Family…"
"The Yu Family…" Xiao Yuansi stroked his chin and offered his condolences, speaking softly, "I have heard about them in Lixia Prefecture. When my clan uncle reached the Foundation Establishment Realm, the Yu Family also sent someone to offer congratulations. I have heard their actions are ruthless and tyrannical, and now I have seen it for myself."
After speaking, Xiao Yuansi shook his head and returned to the topic at hand with a smile. "It is just that your clan has no suitable girls of age, so I cannot make a proposal. Our family has an unmarried direct daughter who could marry Yuanjiao… What do you think, Brother Tongya?"
"This is out of the question!"
Li Tongya was stunned at how Xiao Yuansi proposed this marriage and immediately exclaimed, "Such a marriage alliance between our families would be us overreaching! This cannot be allowed…"
"Ah." Xiao Yuansi smiled warmly and continued, "I see that Qingxiao is only about three to five years old and has not grown up yet. We can wait a few years, there is no rush."
Li Tongya dismissed the younger ones and bowed deeply, saying earnestly, "A direct daughter marrying our Yuanjiao is really inappropriate! Please reconsider, Senior!"
"Don't worry, Brother Tongya! The ancestor favors your clan… I'll handle this, and there will be no problem from our side," Xiao Yuansi said, attempting to persuade him further.
However, Li Tongya remained bowed, saying solemnly, "I know you mean well, Senior, but our family cannot accept it… Please reconsider, Senior!"
Xiao Yuansi paused, thought for a moment, and seemed to understand something. He then said quietly, "I did not consider this carefully… Please forgive me, Brother Tongya."
"You're too kind, Senior!" Li Tongya replied as he thanked Xiao Yuansi.
Xiao Yuansi then stroked his beard and continued, "In that case, we do have a direct concubine-born daughter named Xiao Guiluan—who is excellent in character and appearance. She is surely a perfect match for Yuanjiao!"
"Thank you for your understanding, Senior!" Li Tongya immediately agreed, then paused when he recalled something.
"I heard from Donghe that your family's main peak is called Mount Xianyou, and there is a river named Yue River… Is that true?" he asked.
"Yes," Xiao Yuansi nodded, slightly puzzled.
Li Tongya then asked, "Senior, do you know Xiao Xianyou?"
Xiao Yuansi's expression immediately grew serious, and with a wave of his hand, the courtyard gate closed tightly. Mana flowed around it, isolating them.
"Brother Tongya… how did you learn that name? Xiao Xianyou is from our line and is the ancestor's second uncle!"
Li Tongya hesitated and then recounted, "I once obtained a sword and when I channeled River True Essence into it, I obtained a secret technique known as River Crossing Torrential Step, which was created by Ancestor Xianyou…"
"Is that true?" Xiao Yuansi was overjoyed at this news. Li Tongya took out the sword, but the emblem of Lingyu Gate had already been replaced by a generic engraving. Xiao Yuansi took a closer look at it and shook his head in disappointment.
"It is just a standard dharma sword, with nothing remarkable about it," he said finally.
Li Tongya nodded and pulled out a jade slip, saying softly, "Since this belongs to your family's ancestor, I'll return it to you, Senior."
"This…"
A footwork technique was precious, and for Li Tongya to offer it so freely left Xiao Yuansi stunned. He wanted to refuse, but words failed him.
River Crossing Torrential Step held exceptional significance to the Xiao Family, far beyond that of an ordinary Grade Three footwork technique. Xiao Yuansi sighed quietly and said, "Brother Tongya, your integrity is impressive, but I do not know what to offer in return. Is your clan lacking anything at the moment?"
