Daoist Master Yuanwu! Li Xuanfeng's heart sank abruptly. Yet, he noticed that Tang Shedu's expression lacked the arrogance and brazenness he had expected. Instead, Tang Shedu appeared somewhat apprehensive, his head slightly lowered as if he didn't dare to meet anyone's gaze.
Similarly, Daoist Master Yuanwu did not make a move. His golden-patterned eyes remained fixed on something behind Li Xuanfeng, smoldering with restrained anger. The oppressive atmosphere felt heavy enough to drip water.
Sure enough, a gentle breeze swept past, and a figure clad in green robes stepped forward, stopping in front of Li Xuanfeng. The man crossed his arms over his chest, a faintly swaying pale gold jade seal at his waist. His tone was lighthearted as he spoke, "Senior Brother, it has been a long time."
This man was none other than Daoist Master Yuan Su, Ning Tiaoxiao. It was clear that Daoist Master Yuanwu had already learned of his disciple's death and had come seeking retribution as soon as Tang Shedu exited the grotto heaven. Equally prepared, Ning Tiaoxiao had anticipated Yuanwu's arrival and was already waiting here.
"Tiaoxiao, He killed my disciple," Daoist Master Yuanwu's cold gaze swept forward, yet it was blocked by the presence of Yuan Su.
Li Xuanfeng understood that he should not meet Yuanwu's gaze and followed Tang Shedu's lead, bowing his head low. Yuan Su, standing in front of him, simply smiled, "Senior Brother, you exaggerate! It is just one disciple. You have plenty more. It was merely a misunderstanding—our juniors fought over treasures, and in the heat of the moment, someone struck too hard… Surely, you would not have allowed Yu Muxian to reach the Purple Mansion Realm anyway. He did not have long to live, so what is the harm in compensating with some spirit artifacts to settle this matter?"
Yuanwu's face darkened further as he responded in a low tone, "He was no ordinary disciple!"
Yuan Su, appearing to know more than he let on, chuckled nonchalantly and casually remarked, "His talent was indeed remarkable."
"Ning Tiaoxiao! Yu Muxian carried many secrets, perhaps even some profound opportunities. By killing him, these people have ruined my plans!" Yuanwu's icy voice rose as the two spirit artifacts by his side began to spin rapidly.
However, Yuan Su stood his ground, meeting Yuanwu's gaze head-on and countering bluntly, "What secrets could he possibly have? Senior Brother, do not let yourself be deceived by tricks."
The atmosphere was tense, as if a drawn sword hung in the air. The sea churned with low rumbling sounds, splitting apart like receding tides. On one side, the water boiled into a pale blue froth, while on the other, it remained golden and calm, smooth as a mirror.
The divine abilities of the two Daoist Masters collided subtly in the air, growing increasingly fierce. On the nearby island, Lin Chensheng and Kan Ziyu's expressions turned pale. Without hesitation, they flew into the water to escape, not even taking time to tend to their injuries, desperately fleeing for their lives.
Just then, two more figures emerged from the great void. At the forefront was a Daoist Master wearing a dark-blue robe, his white hair flowing as he traversed the air with a calm demeanor.
The confrontation between the two Daoist Masters immediately paused as they turned to the newcomers. Daoist Master Yuanwu glanced at the lead figure and spoke in a low voice, "Xiao Chuting?"
Xiao Chuting's sudden arrival disrupted the stalemate. He stepped forward with a faint smile and addressed Daoist Master Yuanwu, "It has been so many years. It is rare to meet you, Senior."
Daoist Master Yuanwu's expression darkened as he cast a quick glance at both Xiao Chuting and Yuan Su.
Xiao Chuting, speaking softly, said, "I am here to offer my apologies… My family's junior acted impulsively and caused the death of a disciple of the Azure Pond Sect. Now that the killer has paid with their life, I suppose this resolves the grievance."
Daoist Master Yuan Su, playing with his jade seal, casually added, "Yes, yes. Senior Brother, you have always been fond of Auric Stones. I will send some your way. Let us not waste any more time here!"
With this, Yuanwu was given a graceful exit. His expression softened slightly, though resentment still lingered as he thought of Li Yuanjiao's death. He had nowhere to vent his anger, but more importantly, suspicions gnawed at his heart.
Yuanwu was convinced that Yu Muxian harbored many secrets. Now, with such an abrupt and inconclusive death, he couldn't help but suspect, Could it be… that the boy staged his death to escape me? But in the great void… it's about to begin, I can't afford any delays.
Doubt clouded his mind, and his face remained grim. He spoke in a low voice, "Since the two of you have said so, I will visit in a few days to discuss compensation."
Xiao Chuting and Yuan Su seemed to have anticipated his concession. Watching him leave, they cupped their fists politely to each other before parting ways too. Yuan Su turned back to Li Xuanfeng and instructed lightly, "We are heading into the Great Void for a gathering. This matter is not over yet. Stay put, settle your family affairs, and return to guard the southern border within three months."
Without waiting for Li Xuanfeng's response, Yuan Su flicked his robe and vanished.
The world fell silent. Only the pristine blue sea and bright sky remained, tranquil and serene as if the intense confrontation had never taken place.
After the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters had all departed, Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong finally let out sighs of relief and took to the skies. Li Xuanfeng felt utterly exhausted, so much so that he didn't even have the energy to respond to his niece's questions.
The two flew through the air until they reached the edge of Lake Xian. There, Li Xuanfeng nearly collapsed from the sky, forcing him to land and sit cross-legged to meditate and recover.
Li Qinghong stood guard by his side, ensuring his safety. She took out the relics her uncle had given her earlier.
Not daring to open the jade box, she held it in her arms for a while before carefully setting it aside. Then, she retrieved a jade bottle tied to her belt—one of Li Yuanjiao's belongings—and examined it closely.
"This must be the Foundation Establishment Realm artifact, the Profound Patterned Bottle..." she murmured.
Thinking of its name, her lips trembled, and she let out a quiet sob.
The small bottle was no wider than two fingers, simple yet elegant, adorned with dark silver profound patterns. Li Qinghong hesitated for a moment before injecting her true essence into it.
The inscriptions on the bottle lit up one by one, visibly shimmering with silver radiance. To her amazement, the patterns shifted and transformed, changing from cloud-like designs into jagged thunderbolts, as though fractured with cracks.
The bottle, having lost its previous owner, was quickly refined by her. Its surface glowed as streaks of black lightning surged forth.
"What?" she exclaimed.
The moment the lightning appeared, Li Qinghong instinctively suppressed it. She glanced worriedly toward the stone cave where Li Xuanfeng meditated, then distanced herself to study the artifact further.
The dark purple inscriptions and the bottle's silver base emitted a dense black cloud, which rose into the sky and spread out, forming a thundercloud. Lightning crackled from within, striking the ground violently.
"Not bad... At least it could hinder a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator," she thought, analyzing its potential. Turning the bottle upside down, she let it float mid-air.
Boom!
Thunder roared. The bottle unleashed a torrent of purple lightning bolts, spiraling out with tremendous force. They struck the mountainside, leaving charred marks in their wake.
"This is much stronger! Nearly equivalent to a full-strength strike from an early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator!" she surmised.
Having seen her elder brother use this artifact many times, she quickly grasped its essence. "This artifact is far more intricate than it appears. Perhaps its effects vary depending on the cultivator's immortal foundation... Truly an ancient artifact! Fascinating!" she concluded.
Her spiritual sense swept over the bottom of the bottle, revealing a series of small characters etched into its base, "Li Qianyuan of the Wei State's Li Clan."
Li Qinghong silently put the artifact away. Suddenly, the formation at the entrance of the stone cave dissolved, and Li Xuanfeng emerged. His black gold armor gleamed under the light, and his complexion looked much better than before. He glanced at the bottle hanging from her belt and asked softly, "How is it?"
