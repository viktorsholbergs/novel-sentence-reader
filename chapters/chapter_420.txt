Murong Xia was the Master Monk who had once passed through the Li Family's territory over a decade ago. While traveling and consuming humans, he eventually found himself in Linghai Prefecture. Sitting in the golden seat with his swollen belly, he smacked his lips and proclaimed loudly, "This old monk is about to be enlightened… This old monk is about to be enlightened!"
Those from the Yu Family naturally began congratulating him. Blood began flowing out from Murong Xia's lower body. He flipped over as if trying to adjust his posture before exclaiming suddenly, "ALAS!"
BOOM!
His enormous belly burst open, emitting a strange fragrance and radiating bursts of colorful light. The sounds of whistling wind, a pleasant melody, and the laughter of men, women, and children erupted powerfully from within him.
From the bloody remains of his body, a baby emerged from Murong Xia's stomach. He rapidly aged into a seventeen or eighteen-year-old figure with an androgynous and serene face. He had fourteen arms, each wielding a dharma artifact.
As he moved, shimmery golden powder fell from his body, instantly transforming into animated figures that scurried about in excitement.
The Yu Family, witnessing this surreal scene, recoiled in horror with their eyes wide open in shock. The androgynous being picked up Murong Xia's lifeless torso and consumed it as if it were a cucumber, devouring it in just four or five bites.
"Delicious."
Blood trickled from the corner of the Maha's mouth as his figure began to swell dramatically. In mere moments, he had grown to the size of a hill, his massive form blotting out the sun. As he towered over houses and cities, crushing them beneath his feet, he parted his lips slightly and spoke in a soft, mysterious voice.
"I, Murong Xia, have today attained enlightenment as the Ninth Maha Reincarnate. I have connected with the Six Paths of Compassion World View and gained great divine ability... In seven days, I invite all fellow cultivators to join me at the religious assembly..."
His voice rippled through the air smoothly like water, garnering echoes of congratulations. Cultivators from various sects in the north and south voiced their praises as Murong Xia stood silent and proud in Linghai Prefecture.
Murong Xia moved his gaze and was about to say something when the void before him suddenly tore open. A man in white emerged, cradling a sword and regarding him silently.
His face, obscured by mist, remained unseen, halting Murong Xia's attempt to speak immediately. The celebratory sounds vanished too, leaving only a deadly silence around them.
"S-Shangyuan…"
A flicker of fear crossed Murong Xia's androgynous, compassionate face, and he lowered his fourteen slender arms.
Daoist Master Shangyuan, clutching his sword, stared coldly at him and gave a simple command.
"Return to Yan State."
Arrogance immediately left Murong Xia's face as he looked visibly deflated. He shrank until his body became the size of a normal human again before he quickly scurried off into the void and vanished without a word.
The remaining Yu Family members were still kneeling in terror. They watched as Daoist Master Shangyuan also disappeared into the void without sparing them a single glance, leaving behind an empty city marked only by two large footprints.
Phew!
The Yu Family members wiped the sweat from their foreheads, exchanged glances with each other, and then snorted coldly before dispersing.
Meanwhile on Mount Yuting…
Li Qinghong had said her farewells to Li Yuanjiao before settling into a period of cultivation on Mount Yuting. However, she soon felt the Vast Sky Fierce Sparrow within her becoming restless. With frustration in her heart, her progress was slowed.
"How could this be...?"
She set her spear down horizontally, her brow furrowed in deep thought.
Could it be that a devil cultivator has trespassed on my grounds, or perhaps there is a disturbance in the blood qi that has affected my talisman qi...? It might also be that I haven't had a proper fight in too long... All these years, the battles have been swift, decided within a few moves.
Li Qinghong was not one for a peaceful life of quiet cultivation; she thrived in the heat of battle, only making progress when her spear was stained with blood. Now, having spent nearly a decade on Mount Yuting, practicing sporadically, her progress had naturally begun to slow down.
After offending that demonic creature, I dare not enter Mount Dali recklessly. The demons in Moongaze Lake lurk in its dark undercurrents, elusive and well-hidden...
She missed her family, but knowing she could not venture far, Li Qinghong decided to settle on Mount Yuting. Cradling her spear, she watched the sunrise silently. Suddenly, her thoughts were interrupted by a loud noise and the crunching of snow underfoot.
"Auntie!"
Li Xijun approached, walking on the snow. He cupped his fist respectfully and said, "There's a monk by the lake, and he has constructed a hut at the mountain's base to meditate."
"A monk..?"
Li Tongya's incident had left Li Qinghong with a deep-seated hatred for monks. She frowned immediately, gripping her spear tightly as she asked in a cold voice, "What is his cultivation realm?"
"Appears to be just a monk," Li Xijun replied, raising an eyebrow with concern, fearing his aunt's impulsiveness.
He quickly added, "Auntie, this person traveled south under the guise of a mere monk, so he must have powerful backing… Please exercise caution and avoid unnecessary risks."
"I know," Li Qinghong replied, her almond eyes narrowing as she clutched her spear.
"Yet, we cannot allow him to stay at the base of our mountain. What if he is lying in wait for Brother Jiao's return? Send someone to inquire why this bald cur has come," she instructed.
After a brief pause, she continued, "Ensure that those at Lijing are aware of the situation… and ready to act anytime to suppress this threat."
"The Family Head has been informed," Li Xijun replied with a nod.
Together, they approached the formation plate. Li Qinghong reached out with her delicate hand and pressed on it, sending her spiritual sense through the device to survey the surroundings. As expected, she found a monk seated amidst the grass at the foot of the mountain.
The monk was clad in a brown robe with wide sleeves, his head marked with ordination scars. His face was round and his features were unassuming, though not unattractive.
He sat cross-legged with a bronze-ringed monk staff resting on his knees, his eyes firmly shut.
After Li Xijun issued instructions, the formation soon stirred slightly. An Siwei approached warily with a spear in hand and said softly, "I am An Siwei of the Li Family... Venerable monk, what brings you from afar? Do you have any questions?"
The monk opened his small eyes and replied, "I am Kongheng of the Liao River Temple in Yan State… I wish to meet with the peak master of Yuting. Could you kindly convey my request?"
An Siwei, having received Li Xijun's instruction before descending the mountain, nodded and inquired, "May I know what you would like to find out, Master Kongheng? At least, that will make it easier for me to relay it to the peak master."
Kongheng paused gently before replying, "I come with no ill intentions. My journey is merely dictated by the path of Buddhism and the workings of fate, thus I have traveled far to wait here for the peak master."
An Siwei, unable to return empty-handed, pressed further, but the monk's replies circled back to his initial statement. Reluctantly, he returned up the mountain to report his words.
Li Qinghong, typically wary of Buddhist cultivators, shook her head upon hearing this and said, "We know nothing of this monk's background, and it wouldn't be right to kill him outright… Let him wait if he so wishes. Additionally, send someone to the Xiao Family to inquire about this Liao River Temple."
The two boys departed right away to carry out her orders. Li Qinghong, finding her cultivation progress stalling, retrieved the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique manual and began studying two of the secret techniques in it.
After several days of studies, An Siwei returned, bearing his spear and speaking gravely.
"Peak master, this monk initially claimed to be treating ailments. However, the townspeople, still traumatized by Murong Xia, have ignored him. Undeterred, he has now settled in a hut at the mountain's base, continuing his cultivation alone!"
Li Qinghong set aside her jade slip and asked softly, "What did the Xiao Family say?"
