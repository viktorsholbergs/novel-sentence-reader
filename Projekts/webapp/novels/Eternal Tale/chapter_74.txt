Half a year later, the Foundation Establishment Pills in the alchemy hall were successfully refined. Chen Xun took the initiative to volunteer and offered to deliver the Foundation Establishment Pills to Ji Kun. He mentioned that they both came from the Nine Stars Valley and wanted to accompany him on his final journey.
The elders had no objections. It made sense to fulfill this request, and there was no benefit in giving Foundation Establishment Pills to a rogue cultivator. Most people in the sect had failed in foundation building, and there had been past grievances within the sect because of it.
They handed Chen Xun a jade bottle containing a glossy black Foundation Establishment Pill. The Five Elements Sect had strict rules, and any embezzlement would be severely punished. If a Foundation Establishment Pill was found not delivered to a disciple, the consequences ranged from punishment in the enforcement hall to the complete annulment of cultivation and expulsion from the sect.
Chen Xun, accompanied by a big black ox, flew on his sword. He had swapped the original Foundation Establishment Pill in the bottle with a new one—a white, unmarked Foundation Establishment Pill that he had coated with a black substance.
Arriving at the familiar old house, Ji Kun's eyes showed sharpness. He remained calm and waited for Chen Xun to arrive.
Whoosh!
A sword light approached from the distant sky. Ji Kun smiled, recognizing the large black figure; it must be Junior Ox. It always liked to stay behind Chen Xun.
"Ji Kun!" Chen Xun saw the figure in front of the house and suddenly burst into laughter.
"Senior Uncle Chen!" Ji Kun bowed deeply, and this address was filled with many emotions—resignation, understanding, expectations, and deep gratitude.
"We've come to deliver the Foundation Establishment Pill for you."
"Moo moo!"
Descending on their swords, they presented the jade bottle with joy in their eyes, ready to hand it to Ji Kun. However, Ji Kun remained bowed; the Foundation Establishment Pill was no longer too important to him. Even if he couldn't build his foundation, having friends like Chen Xun was enough for him in this lifetime.
"Take it quickly." Chen Xun lifted him with a burst of energy, but suddenly, both he and the big black ox widened their eyes.
At this moment, Ji Kun was crying bitterly. Tears flowed, but no sound came out. Even the snot bubbles burst when he took a breath.
The scene was so beautiful that Chen Xun and the big black ox couldn't hold back their laughter. Their stomachs kept twitching, but they managed to maintain their composure and respect for Ji Kun, refraining from laughing out loud.
"Quick, take it. Remember, you still owe me two thousand contributions." Chen Xun laughed, taking out a sachet from his storage bag. "If your foundation is successful, open it and destroy it."
"Yes, Senior Chen." Ji Kun carefully accepted it without asking for the reason. He took out a magical tool from his storage bag. "Senior Uncle Chen, this is yours, but I will never owe you those thousands of contributions."
"Well, what magical tool could we possibly use in the herb garden? Just return the contributions when the time comes."
"Moo moo!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox shook their heads, not caring at all.
Ji Kun frowned. He had to return the magical tool to Chen Xun today, but unexpectedly, Chen Xun suddenly screamed, "Old Ox, draw your sword and retreat quickly!"
"Moo~~"
Whoosh! Whoosh!
A gust of dust swept by, and Ji Kun swallowed a mouthful of dust, standing dumbfounded. Watching Chen Xun and the black ox disappear into the horizon, he remained silent for a long time, appreciating the swift and carefree figures.
"Hehe, Senior Chen, Junior Ox, who exactly are you..." Ji Kun gazed at the sky with a faint smile, feeling a warm glow in his heart.
...
Chen Xun and the big black ox did not return to the herb garden but went to the alchemy hall. They heard that Senior Sister Zuo was here today; she was an expert alchemist, and many inner disciples' Foundation Establishment Pills were crafted by her hands.
"Old Ox, show a bit more emotion, yes, more sorrowful."
Chen Xun adjusted the ox's head while the big black ox raised its head, eyes filled with melancholy, continuously mooing softly.
"Beautiful, just like this," Chen Xun coughed, then immediately changed his expression, entering the main hall while mourning with the big black ox as if an ox had died at home.
A desolate and depressing atmosphere lingered around them, shocking passing disciples. What happened to Senior Uncle and his spiritual beast?
Zuo Yiyin, upon hearing that Chen Xun sought an audience, was also surprised when she saw their appearance. Did the herb garden get destroyed?!
To her surprise, Chen Xun said, "Senior Sister Zuo, this matter is indeed regrettable. The techniques in the Contribution Hall are too expensive and not suitable for my constitution. Do you have any basic Foundation Establishment techniques that are widely available?"
Zuo Yiyin was astonished at this unexpected turn. This time, Chen Xun had genuinely made her laugh. Her eyes, clear as water, displayed a graceful smile as she said, "When you joined the sect, I neglected to mention that there are very few people with Foundation Establishment potential for the five elemental roots. The main hall didn't prepare such techniques."
"Hehe, hehe." Chen Xun awkwardly arched his hand, knowing that such basic techniques couldn't meet the standards of the main hall.
"Junior Brother, wait for me," Zuo Yiyin whispered, and a fragrant breeze blew through. In the blink of an eye, she disappeared from the spot.
However, this made Chen Xun and the big black ox's eyes widen. Was this a body technique? They wanted to integrate their strength and speed into Foundation Establishment period spells, but they hadn't found a way yet.
Not long after, Zuo Yiyin returned, holding a technique book. She said, "Junior Brother Chen Xun, I'm gifting you this 'Hundred Refinements Five Elements Secret.'"
"Foundation Establishment techniques usually come with special spells. Although this one doesn't have any outstanding features, it includes a small body technique called 'Five Elements Shadow Concealment.'"
"I think it's quite suitable for someone like Junior Brother Chen, who cultivates herbs. Even if your combat abilities are not strong, having a body technique for self-defense outside the sect could be beneficial.
She pointed, and the technique book floated over, landing perfectly in Chen Xun's hands.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were deeply moved. He solemnly said, "Thank you, Senior Sister Zuo, for your generous gift!"
Even though women might affect their cultivation speed, rich women wouldn't. They would only provide themselves with better techniques.
"Moo moo~~"
The big black ox also lowered its head, expressing gratitude to Senior Sister Zuo. Truly deserving of being the deputy peak master, she was considerate in everything.
"This is what Junior Brother Chen deserves. This technique isn't precious. Go ahead,"
Zuo Yiyin smiled slightly. Similar techniques were abundant, and the Foundation Establishment techniques for the five elemental roots were gradually being abandoned.
With the development of the cultivation world, resources were depleting, and many herbs had become extinct. Nowadays, even the Foundation Establishment for the five elemental roots is challenging.
Many high-ranking figures in the Qian Nation had come to the same conclusion. The massive consumption of resources in ancient times was due to cultivators with mixed elemental roots; they were too resource-intensive and numerous.
Looking at the numerous Foundation Establishment techniques passed down, their speculations were not groundless. These techniques were not only ordinary but also quite mediocre.
However, Chen Xun and the big black ox treated it as a treasure. They kept expressing their gratitude along the way, remembering this favor.
"Old Ox, why do you think we can't become deputy peak masters, but Senior Sister Zuo can?"
"Moo?"
"Because of the presence! Does the alchemy hall lack a Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivator? Probably not. However, only Senior Sister Zuo can handle it. If there were a vote, I'd vote for Senior Sister Zuo first!"
"Moo moo!!" The big black ox's eyes lit up, constantly nudging Chen Xun. It also wanted to vote for Senior Sister Zuo.
"Hahaha..."
Laughter echoed on the road, lifting a heavy burden off their hearts. They finally solved the problem of techniques. They walked towards the herb garden with joyful steps.
