Chen Xun suddenly felt an extremely strong tremor in his heart. He abruptly opened his eyes and looked toward the corner of the street.
It was a familiar silhouette... She had matured significantly, exuding an aura of authority effortlessly. The flowers in the eastern part of the city had already bloomed, and her figure was getting closer.
Chen Xun slowly stood up, revealing a smile. "Senior, are you here to purchase talismans?"
The woman looked around, staring at Chen Xun's face for a long time before speaking softly, "Yes."
"Please."
"Alright."
Her expression remained calm as she entered the store. She meticulously examined the various talismans on the counter, afraid to miss anything.
"Have you been running this shop all these years?"
"Hehe, to be honest, my ancestors also ran a shop in the mortal world. This craft has been passed down through generations."
"A blacksmith shop?"
"...Yes." Chen Xun remained calm, but there was a considerable distance between the two.
"However, I've never seen talismans like these. They seem similar to ordinary talismans but have something different within."
"Hehe, Senior, you must have..."
"No need, they are quite good." The woman turned around, interrupting Chen Xun. "I once had an old acquaintance who looked somewhat like you, a shopkeeper. But I don't remember how many years it's been. A hundred years? Two hundred? Maybe four hundred?" She thought seriously, then suddenly smiled. "It's been too long, I can't recall..."
"Is that so?" Chen Xun raised an eyebrow. "That must be my good fortune."
The woman, with a delicate and elegant face, stood there with a serene yet slightly sorrowful smile. "Have you been well all these years?"
"Quite well."
"Moo?!!!"
Suddenly, an ox came from the backyard. Its eyes were wide open, pupils trembling, stunned on the spot.
The woman saw the big black ox too, her smile deepening. "Shopkeeper, is this black ox also a family heirloom?"
"Yes." Chen Xun replied decisively, without a moment's hesitation.
"May I sit?"
"Please, Senior." Chen Xun hurriedly set up the table and chairs, standing aside somewhat at a loss.
"Shopkeeper, you sit too." The woman extended a slender hand, her face calm.
"Alright."
A hint of complexity flashed in Chen Xun's eyes, but he still sat across from her.
The woman didn't speak, seemingly observing Chen Xun. She opened her lips slightly. "My name is Liu Yuan."
Chen Xun's heart trembled, his breath becoming slightly rapid, a smile spreading across his face. "So, I should call you Senior Liu."
"It seems I truly mistook you for someone else." Liu Yuan's expression relaxed slightly. "Indeed, it's been too long. I've even forgotten the appearance of old friends."
"Senior, distinguished people often forget things." Chen Xun's face bore a typical expression of a common shopkeeper, with a hint of regret in his eyes. "For us cultivators, being associated with someone like Senior is a blessing."
"Alright, since you say so, I will give you an opportunity."
Liu Yuan quickly continued, as if afraid Chen Xun might change his mind. She took out a token from her storage ring, engraved with the words 'Five Elements Sect'.
Chen Xun's pupils contracted. Why did this token feel so familiar...
"This token was given to me by a deceased friend from the sect, to be left for 'his' descendants." With a slight wave of her hand, the token appeared in front of Chen Xun. "That person looked somewhat like you, shopkeeper. Perhaps you are his descendant."
"May I ask, Senior, who was this deceased... friend?"
"His name was Ji Kun." Liu Yuan said solemnly, her gaze never leaving Chen Xun.
Chen Xun's fingers trembled slightly, but he maintained his smile. "So, you are a senior from the Five Elements Sect. I've heard so much about you."
"If you wish, you may join the Five Elements Sect directly as an honorary elder."
"Alright, alright." Chen Xun quickly nodded, carefully putting away the token. "Thank you, Senior."
His face showed a flattering smile, but his heart felt like it was sinking into a bottomless abyss. He knew well how hard it was for vagabond cultivators from Nine Star Valley and how difficult the path to immortality was. If he truly had descendants, the token left by Senior Brother Ji could potentially change their lives...
Liu Yuan smiled but didn't even ask Chen Xun's name.
"Actually, Junior Brother Ji left some words before he departed."
"Senior, this is inappropriate." Chen Xun's expression finally changed slightly. "I am not your old acquaintance, nor do I wish to be someone's shadow."
"He said that during his journey to Southern Dipper Mountain, two incredibly powerful beings saved him. He didn't know who they were." Liu Yuan continued as if talking to herself. "But he gave a book of ancient inheritance to a dear friend, believing that it would go further in his handsâ€¦ He hoped that this old friend would take it to see the legendary future world."
"Heh... hehe." Chen Xun laughed softly. "Senior, this has nothing to do with me."
"My time is running out, and I haven't been able to find his descendants. I can only place my hope on you." Liu Yuan showed a sorrowful smile. "Shopkeeper, I hope you don't mind."
Chen Xun's fingers trembled again, and he remained silent. He felt that he had already come to terms with everything...
In the backyard, the big black ox's pupils continued to tremble. It kept snorting and slowly retreated step by step.
A cold wind blew outside the shop, and the green leaves of the two crane spirit trees at the door fell continuously. Although it was clearly spring, there was an inexplicable desolation.
"Alright, I understand." Chen Xun smiled, lowering his head. "It seems I was being ignorant."
"Then I won't disturb you anymore, and I won't come again in the future." Liu Yuan stood up gracefully, her gaze still calm. "In a few words, the shopkeeper is indeed not that old acquaintance. It was my mistake."
"Take care, Senior."
"See me off."
"Alright."
Chen Xun led the way outside, stopping in front of the rocking chair with a respectful gesture.
Liu Yuan's gaze suddenly softened. She looked at Chen Xun carefully, glanced at the backyard, and then turned to leave.
In an instant, that familiar yet unfamiliar figure was already far away.
Chen Xun sat weakly in the chair, his hands crossed, pressing the Five Elements Sect token tightly in his palm.
His deep gaze turned northward, unfocused, as if extending infinitely. Liu Yuan walked slowly eastward. The two of them never looked back at each other, like two paths in the sky that would never intersect again.
She had walked very far, far enough that she could no longer see the figure sitting in front of the shop. People still hurried along the street, and the laughter of passing cultivators continued.
Liu Yuan finally couldn't hold back, tears welling up in her eyes. "Chen Xun... Senior Brother, Black Ox, how could I not know it's you? Seeing you alive is really wonderful..." Liu Yuan looked up at the sky, as if the pressure of these hundreds of years was released at that moment. "Senior Brother Chen, you truly are not an ordinary cultivator..."
She couldn't help but recall that day, the figure under the maple tree. His true cultivation level might have surpassed her understanding. But Liu Yuan felt no resentment. Such a legendary figure had his reasons for everything he did. Meeting someone like Chen Xun was already a great blessing.
