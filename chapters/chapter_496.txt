Mount Qingdu had been here for nearly ten years now. The earth vein had shifted, and three small peaks had emerged on either side, varying in height. The tallest of these mountains rose about a hundred ren, reaching halfway up the main Qingdu Peak, while the shortest stood at fifty to sixty ren. Many houses had been constructed on these slopes. [1]
The highest secondary peak was Talisman Peak which was reserved all year round for Li Xuanxuan, along with several apprentices that were practicing the Talisman Dao.
As for the lower peaks, they were occupied by the brothers from the minor sect of the Li Family—Li Chengchu and Li Chengyou.
By now, those two brothers had successfully condensed the Jade Capital Chakra. They had been working alongside Li Xicheng to manage family affairs and were considered reliable.
Xicheng conducts himself well… The two brothers have been raised in Qingdu Cave Dwelling since childhood as well; they are both loyal and dependable.
Li Yuanjiao rode the wind and landed back at Mount Qingdu. The cave entrance atop the mountain was brightly lit, and guarded by two men. The stone steps he descended led to a huge cave dwelling.
The former Snake Demon Cave Dwelling was now known as Qingdu Cave Dwelling, having been renovated by the Li Family over the decades. The holes in the walls were neatly arranged, and though the spiritual energy here was not particularly strong, it was extremely spacious and capable of accommodating several Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators.
Supporting Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators was a challenge for many prestigious clans. Thanks to Li Tongya's foresight in claiming this site years ago, the Li Family faces no shortage of space even with an increasing number of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators now.
The fire vein on Mount Wutu has been developed, and Kong Gusun of the Profound Peak Gate is still overseeing it, ensuring its stability. Ximing has started to relocate there... Qinghong is in seclusion again; no wonder it feels so deserted here.
As he was observing the scenery before him, Li Xijun approached on the wind and bowed respectfully.
"Greetings, Second Uncle."
Li Yuanjiao nodded in response and asked, "When do you plan to attempt a breakthrough in seclusion?"
Although Li Xijun had always been dependable when it came to work, he had lingered at the fifth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm for some time now, accumulating his cultivation. Given the majestic aura he now possessed, he seemed ready for a breakthrough.
"Probably within these few days," he replied respectfully.
Li Xijun and Li Yuanjiao wandered around the Qingdu Cave Dwelling for a while when a faint sound suddenly caught their attention.
Li Yuanjiao remarked, "Ahead is…"
"Most of the children of the Cheng and Ming generation are cultivating in this cave dwelling," Li Xijun replied.
It was only at this moment that realization dawned upon Li Yuanjiao.
"More than ten years have passed without us noticing, and the children from the generation of Cheng and Ming have grown up…"
The two of them rode the wind forward and found a group of teenagers gathered in the courtyard, sparring with each other in excitement.
These boys and girls were, of course, the children of the Cheng and Ming generation in the family.
This was the first time Li Yuanjiao had seen this group of children. He gently observed them, concealing his presence. Since these children had yet to reach the Jade Capital Stage, he could easily hide himself without using the power of his Profound Patterned Bottle.
Li Xijun had been in seclusion for several years, dedicating himself to rigorous cultivation with little time to spend with family, so he had only seen the children a few times before. He too performed a hand seal to conceal his presence, then stood among the clouds and watched them.
The youngest among them was only six, while the oldest was about fifteen or sixteen. Their cultivation levels ranged from the first to the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.
"No wonder Brother Cheng said there's no one who particularly stands out… Most of these children can only be considered slightly above average."
Li Xicheng, the least talented among the Xi and Yue generation, had already reached the Celestial Whirl Stage at fifteen. Although the generation of Cheng and Ming was flourishing, most of its members in the major sect were promoted from the minor sect. Li Xicheng and a few cultivators of the Xi and Yue generation were yet to have children, leaving no one with extraordinary talent.
Li Xijun's gaze lingered on the group in the courtyard. While none was particularly outstanding, the oldest boy was tall and spoke with an air of confidence.
With thick eyebrows and sparkling eyes, he held a spear in his hand and stood in the center of the courtyard, managing his younger brothers and sisters, who all seemed to respect him.
Li Xijun observed him closely as he organized the matches among the children, instructed his younger siblings, and helped the injured ones. He found him rather interesting.
Li Yuanjiao, focused intently on the scene below him, noticed the boys and girls chatting together and felt a swell of happiness as he floated down.
"Brother Liao!"
Li Chengliao, now sixteen, was the oldest among the children. With thick eyebrows, he appeared unremarkable but commanded attention as he stood with a sword in hand. He had just finished training with the other disciples and invited them to sit together.
Once they were seated, Li Chengliao took a central position. One of the younger disciples asked, "Brother Liao, what are you discussing today? Immortal Foundation?"
Li Chengliao replied, "You all come to me for answers, but there are only a few paths to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm in our family. If you want to find out how miraculous it is, you should just cultivate it yourself."
"Big Brother, you're being unreasonable!"
The girl beside him smiled, her round eyes sparkling and her eyebrows gracefully arched.
"Not many in our family managed to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. You're a direct descendant with exceptional talent, capable of succeeding in anything you cultivate. We may not be as gifted as you, so we listen for fun… How can we realistically hope to achieve it?" she remarked.
The other boys and girls nodded in agreement glumly. However, a child in the corner piped up, his voice clear and assertive.
"Sister Gong, what you said isn't necessarily true. My father told me that our great-great-grandfather didn't break through to Jade Capital Stage until he was over twenty, and he still managed to establish Boundless Ocean! Foundation Establishment isn't just about talent."
For this group of teenagers, achieving Foundation Establishment was a rare feat, a mark of a great master. The miracle tales of the immortal foundations were passed down through generations, growing more enigmatic with each retelling. Naturally, they all aspired to establish one.
Li Chengliao nodded, adopting the tone of an elder.
"Chenghui is right! Everyone should cultivate diligently. We're all disciples of the major sect and have entered Qingdu. Even if we cannot achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm, we must at least become Qi Cultivators at all costs. We cannot disgrace our lineages!"
The disciples responded with murmurs of agreement. Although a few teenagers exchanged competitive glances, the overall atmosphere among their generation remained harmonious.
Li Chengliao smiled at his brothers and sisters and continued, "I heard our clan has a new method called the Pheasant Flame's Long March Technique, a Grade Four cultivation manual. After consuming the Long Marching Pheasant Flame spiritual qi, one would be able to establish an immortal foundation known as Pheasant Li March."
The girl named Li Minggong eagerly asked, "What's so special about it?"
"How should I know?" Li Chengliao replied, somewhat annoyed. The teenagers erupted into laughter, their eyes filled with longing as they began discussing the technique. Meanwhile, Li Chengyu fell into deep thought.
Standing beside Li Yuanjiao, Li Xijun remarked softly, "Not bad, they all conduct themselves properly… At least they've grown up in Qingdu Cave Dwelling and receive teachings every day."
Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly. His nephew, who was still standing nearby, added with a touch of regret, "It's a pity that although these children are far more talented than their parents, they still seem mediocre. Their chances of achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm are slim."
Li Xijun's words were tactful. However, without encountering any opportunities, these children were unlikely to reach even the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
Li Yuanjiao hummed softly, a rare tenderness filling his eyes as he smiled and said, "In the past, my granduncle was also the most mediocre among his three surviving brothers, with only the hope of reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm. Who would have thought he would become so famous in Jiangnan today? As long as one possesses a spiritual orifice, there is always hope."
He paused before remarking, "It's a pity that the immortal mirror has never favored these children. They can be pillars of support, but never leaders."
Li Xijun lowered his gaze in silence. With a smile, Li Yuanjiao suggested, "Let's go down and have a look."
