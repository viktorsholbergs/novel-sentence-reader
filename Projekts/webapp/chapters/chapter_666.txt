Li Xuanfeng gave his warnings, and Li Xijun nodded silently. The elder casually mentioned some recent affairs, prompting the ever-perceptive Li Xijun to ask, "About the matter concerning Situ Chen from the Golden Tang Gate…?"
Li Xuanfeng’s expression remained unchanged as he denied it outright, saying, "It has nothing to do with me."
The white-robed youth nodded thoughtfully. Meanwhile, Li Xuanfeng pulled Li Zhouwei closer and asked, "Wei’er, Bright Yang is a path of dominion over others. It is said to aid cultivation. Going forward, you must oversee the matters of the family as well."
"Zhouwei understands," responded Li Zhouwei.
Li Zhouwei nodded. Finally unable to contain himself, Li Xijun asked, "Why is it that… Brother Ming cultivates the Bright Yang, yet his case differs from so many descriptions?"
Li Xijun recounted everything about Li Ximing’s situation from beginning to end. Li Xuanfeng stroked his beard and said softly, "I don’t believe Ximing was ever suited for Radiant Lure cultivation! Radiant Lure is a worldly path, people like Xicheng and Chengliao can cultivate it well. But he should have studied the Dao Lineages like Twelve Essences or Jade True Unified Void Essence instead. Right now, his mindset does not align with his Dao lineage. He’s going against his own heart, and that makes it meaningless."
"So that’s how it is!" exclaimed Li Xijun.
Li Xijun felt his hands go numb. He absentmindedly set the jade teapot on the table, suddenly recalling a moonlit night when Li Ximing seemed to have foreseen something. Back then, he had lightly placed the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi in Li Xijun’s hands, proposing to trade cultivation techniques.
A burning pain welled up in the young man’s heart. He said with a low and heavy voice, "We… we never truly understood. We only wanted to leave him the best things…"
Li Xuanxuan listened from the side. Seeing Li Xijun’s expression, a rare flash of anger surfaced on his face as he said, "Don’t start blaming anyone! There's nothing to blame for!"
Li Xuanfeng caught the blame in his elder brother’s gaze and responded softly, "I shouldn’t have spoken, but our Family’s Radiant Essence Scripture is of the highest grade. Ximing has never been at a disadvantage. Even if he had chosen for himself, he would have picked the higher-tier scripture for the sake of his own Dao."
Li Xuanfeng was unaware that Li Xijun and Li Ximing had considered exchanging their cultivation techniques during their younger years, but Li Xijun remembered it vividly. Though his expression quickly returned to calm, deep inside, he mourned, In this matter… and in others… I have failed Brother Ming.
Li Xuanfeng did not linger. After a brief exchange, he rose, retrieved his bow, and said to the others, "I’ll take my leave now. I’ll return home for a visit in a few years."
Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan walked him out together. Li Xuanxuan remained in relatively good spirits, failing to notice the storm of emotions hidden beneath the composed exteriors of his grandnephew and younger brother. Beneath their silence lay a tide of sorrow.
Dofu Mountain, Song Family’s territory.
The Song Family’s territory lay south of Mushroom Forest Plain and north of Helin Prefecture. Neither too large nor too small, it was an old and established family.
However, their current landholding no longer matched their strength, especially after the fall of their last cultivator at the Foundation Establishment Realm. A family at the Qi Cultivation Realm had no business holding such a territory.
It was only because the Song Family had once produced a female cultivator who was willing to become a concubine for a disciple from an immortal sect who had descended from Mount Azure Pond. That disciple later became the sect master of Azure Pond Sect. As for the woman from the Song family, she benefited from his resources and successfully broke through to Foundation Establishment Realm, propelling the Song Family to prominence.
Unexpectedly, this disciple, named Chi Wei, later advanced to the Purple Mansion Realm, and his fortune became boundless. Though the woman from the Song family remained a mere concubine, her status was enough to secure the Song Family’s prosperity for a century.
Such a pity that their descendants are so unworthy, falling to this state!
Yuan Hudu stood silently amidst the deafening sound of gongs and drums. Compared to Yuan Huyuan, he appeared much younger, with deep-set eyes and a higher nose, giving him a more sinister look.
Below, the courtyard bustled with laughter and greetings, yet no one dared to approach him. Only the head of the Song Family stood behind him, wearing a fawning smile and uttering some empty pleasantries.
Yuan Fuyao, dressed in red ceremonial robes, stood in the courtyard with a beaming smile. His childhood sweetheart, veiled, awaited in the rear courtyard. He was undoubtedly in high spirits, having claimed both wealth and beauty. His face was flushed, brimming with satisfaction.
Yuan Hudu, however, merely narrowed his eyes and silently observed the courtyard. Soon, he noticed an elderly man clad in black-golden armor standing at the very edge. The elderly man was watching the scene coldly with his arms crossed..
Without using spiritual sense to probe, Yuan Hudu instinctively sensed that this man was no ordinary figure. He quickly summoned someone and spoke in a low voice, "Go find out. Who in the Li Family has white hair and wears golden armor?"
Yuan Hudu could vaguely guess who he was. Nine times out of ten, he was someone from the Li Family. Yet, he felt no fear. In fact, he had anticipated this moment for some time.
You really held back well. I’ve been wandering outside day after day, and finally, you’ve come! Yuan Hudu thought to himself. If it had been him, he would never have endured this long. He knew the Li Family would come sooner or later, and he had been waiting for their arrival.
A mere broken engagement, surely they won’t kill me over it? At most, I’ll be scolded. Better yet that we end up fighting, maybe I can even get myself injured.
The more strained the relationship between their two families became, the clearer the message would be to the Chi Family. And since his life wouldn't be truly at risk, Yuan Hudu was quite content with this outcome.
Just as long as it’s not him… even if it’s Li Qinghong… But please, not that fiend…
When his subordinate came up and whispered a few words to him, Yuan Hudu’s expression instantly soured. He murmured, "It really is him! Golden Bowstring, Li Xuanfeng!"
Since childhood, Yuan Hudu had never been groomed to be the family head, nor did he possess the extraordinary talent of Yuan Chengdun. He had spent most of his life just struggling to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. How could he not be afraid?
His talent was mediocre, and he lacked skill in combat arts. His breakthrough had relied on medicinal pills, and even among the family cultivators, he was only considered mid-tier. How could he possibly contend with Li Xuanfeng? Even if Li Qinghong had come instead, he would have likely taken his life within a hundred moves.
Yuan Hudu took a deep breath and focused his gaze, only to realize that those commanding, imposing eyes were already staring straight at him.
Damn it!
Yuan Hudu forced a stiff, uneasy smile. His hand clenched tightly around his sleeve, hidden from view. He had long heard that this ruthless man feared nothing, and now, suspicion and dread clawed at his heart.
Finally, he saw the man step forward, moving steadily closer through the bustling, laughing crowd. The people instinctively parted, unconsciously forming a narrow path for him to advance.
To Yuan Hudu’s ears, all other sounds seemed to fade away, leaving only the cold, measured footsteps of those black-golden boots against the ground. He fought the overwhelming urge to flee and forced himself to stand his ground calmly.
Li Xuanfeng walked up to him without stopping, closing the distance until Yuan Hudu could see every detail of the intricate patterns on his Black Gold Spirit Armor. Only then did Li Xuanfeng tilt his head slightly and quietly speak, "Yuan Hudu?"
That cold voice cut through the noisy crowd with eerie clarity, sending a chill down Yuan Hudu’s spine. It made cold sweat break out all over his body.
