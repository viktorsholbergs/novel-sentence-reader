(Flower Shop) Reminiscing on the Day Before the ‘Dawn’
* * *
Hello everyone.
The story you are reading, “The Reincarnated Extra”, will conclude Part 1 with the upcoming 17th arc.
Well, it’s just reaching a milestone, but this author is still pleased to have been able to continue writing up to this point.
This is solely thanks to all of you who have read and supported the story, and I cannot express enough gratitude.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you sincerely.
Now, in this chapter, quite a few characters will appear.
So, up to a point, to make it easy to understand who the story is about when looking back at the table of contents later, I will display it in parentheses in the title.
So, the first one is about Ms. “Flower Shop”.
…Who the hell is that!?
Well then, please enjoy.
In the suburbs of the royal capital of Ashgo, there is a small hill called Mihabyushira Hill.
It is a hill with a good view where you can see all the townscape of the royal capital including the royal castle.
This Mihabyushira Hill was once loved as a place of relaxation for the people of the royal capital because of its wonderful view.
…However, that’s a story of the past.
Now, the grass has completely overgrown, and only a few animal trails remain.
The king took various things away from the people.
Sometimes it was a precious family heirloom passed down through generations.
Or a beautiful daughter.
He took away everything the king desired on a whim.
Why?
“Because I am the ruler,” the king always said.
Life is hard, and everyone trembles in fear of tyranny.
Neighbors are executed for no particular reason.
Everyone is frightened by such daily life.
There’s no way people have the luxury to enjoy the view.
Therefore.
“Hey, did you wait long?”
“…………”
If there was a man and a woman meeting on this hill.
It’s absolutely unthinkable that these two came to this place for a date.
On top of the hill, in a particularly scenic grassland.
In the center of this grassland, there is a black stone pillar about the height of a person, of unknown origin, whether it is a natural object or an artificial one……
The two used this stone pillar as a landmark…… and met at least once a week.
It’s not far from the royal capital, and there are no prying eyes.
The tall grass hides their figures.
It’s a wide area, making it easy to escape in case of emergency.
For these and other reasons, it’s a perfect place for secret talks.
“Oh, you brought a dandelion again today? I wish you would prepare a red rose or something once in a while to make me happy!”
The woman, who arrived late, found a single dandelion placed at the base of the stone pillar and smiled.
The wind blows, swaying her long reddish-brown hair tied together at the back.
This woman, who is dressed like an ordinary town girl you can find anywhere without wearing makeup, is in her mid-20s.
Although she pretends to be plain, she is actually quite a beauty.
“Today, I brought a Trinlas flower. There aren’t many around here, but they do grow naturally. It’s a plain white and small flower, but in the east, it’s said to be a standard flower to give to someone you like.”
After saying that and winking, the woman also placed a flower at the base of the stone pillar.
This is one of the signs that this woman and man use.
If one party cannot come to this place, the other party leaves a flower and leaves this place.
The one who couldn’t come can go to the stone pillar at a later date and check for the presence or absence of a flower to confirm the safety of the other party.
There are other detailed rules, but in a nutshell, this is how it works.
“………… ‘Flower Shop’. You’re just like a real florist.”
At this point, the man, who had been silent until now, suddenly spoke.
This man has a muscular body despite being slim.
He seems to be in his mid-30s.
There are scars all over his body, including his face, giving him a terrifying aura.
And above all…… in this world, it’s quite rare…… this man’s hair and eye color are both solid black.
“Not just like! Have you forgotten, I am a real florist? Both my main business and side business.”
While laughing in a troubled manner, the flower shop girl sat down there.
The man followed suit.
Looking at the royal castle and the royal capital through the gaps in the swaying grass, the two continued their conversation.
……Although, the one talking is mostly the flower shop girl.
The man has a very taciturn nature.
“Well, well, I’ve picked various ‘flowers’ again today. Listen up.”
While smiling, the flower shop girl continues to chat casually.
“Even pitch-black flowers are blooming quite a bit these days, you know? ……I heard you saved a soldier who was about to be executed unreasonably.”
“………… It just turned out that way.”
“The soldier’s name is Toppipappugen. He’s from a fishing village in the south, and he’s also highly trusted by his colleagues…… well, I guess that doesn’t matter? The important thing is, you know, with this incident, you’re starting to be liked even by the enemy soldiers. Haha, it’s really the end times, isn’t it?”
“…………”
In contrast to the smiling flower shop girl, the man has his mouth tightly shut.
He can’t stop her chatter, so the flower shop girl’s mouth continues to move smoothly, and then she accidentally said something unnecessary.
“These days, there are more and more people treating you like a hero. How about it? Why don’t you change your nickname from ‘Grim Reaper’ to ‘Hero’ around here?”
“Don’t make such ridiculous jokes.”
The next moment.
In the blink of an eye, the Grim Reaper’s hand chop was placed against the flower shop girl’s neck.
Confronted with a terrifying amount of killing intent, the flower shop girl…… shrugged her shoulders with a troubled look.
“Yes, yes, I understand…… sorry about that.”
“…………”
Upon receiving the apology from the flower shop girl, the Grim Reaper sat down again.
“The piglets?”
And rarely, he brought up a topic himself.
It seems he really didn’t like the flower shop girl’s ‘joke’.
There doesn’t seem to be time for more banter.
“They ran away. One went south, one went east.”
Looking up at the cloudy sky, the flower shop girl sighed and told him.
“The east is fine, but the south, you know? I heard there’s a big storm right now…… I wonder if that impatient little piglet can wait?”
“The big pig?”
“Not moving. Maybe it’s too fat to move? Or is it the pride of being the ‘ruler’?”
“The monster?”
“Won’t come anymore. It takes a huge amount of money to move that commander. There’s no obligation either. That one will definitely not come.”
After saying that, the flower shop girl seemed to remember something, and her face turned pale as she trembled.
“You fought that one, right? As expected of the ‘Grim Reaper’.”
“………… I just ran away. From an opponent who had no motivation.”
“Still, you managed to escape. That’s impressive.”
“………… …………”
Here, both of them become silent.
An autumn wind blows, and the grass sways.
“When is the ‘dawn’?”
“The one who decides that…… is not the flower shop. It’s God.”
It’s an extremely impudent code word.
The Grim Reaper, while distorting his already unfriendly face into an even more displeased expression…… certainly understood its meaning.
He stood up and then…… glared at the royal castle below.
【Rule】
What an existence influenced by a certain divine jewel aims for.
【Toppipappugen】
An earnest man who is currently back in his hometown serving as the village chief.
【The piglet that ran away to the south】
It’s a disrespectful code word.
This person was the one who triggered Garozg’s rampage.
……So, in other words, his end has already been told.
【Monster】
A nickname for our protagonist Emi-chan.
But in this case, it refers to her mother.
【Grim Reaper】
I don’t think I need to explain who this man is, right?
