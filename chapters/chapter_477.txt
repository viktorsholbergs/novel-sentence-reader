After imparting his advice, Li Yuanjiao felt a sharp pain in his back and tightness in his chest, and was reminded of the wound Zhe Ledai had inflicted on him. He knew he needed to address it urgently.
"I've sustained a minor injury and must recuperate. The seclusion of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator is long, and so I might be unavailable for a few years. Manage the family well in my absence, your brothers will follow your lead. Always consult with your seventh uncle on any matter."
Li Xijun nodded thoughtfully and, as Li Yuanjiao left, he lifted Li Yuexiang from the ground, saying softly, "Come. Big Brother will take you on a walk."
On Mount Lijing…
Dressed in brocade fur, Li Yuanping sat at the end of the hall as usual. Despite his pale face and slightly sunken eyes, he looked in better health after consuming a talisman pill, which had aided in his breakthrough to the Jade Capital stage recently.
This is as far as I can go…
Though the talisman pill had facilitated his breakthrough, it was but a fleeting reprieve. His cultivation still hung in a precarious balance, and another attempt at advancement could hasten his demise.
Setting aside the letter he had been reading without any apparent change in his expression, he motioned for Li Xicheng at his side and whispered, "Is Meng Taizhi and his daughter around…?"
Li Xicheng cupped his fist and replied, "Meng Taizhi had ventured out to gather qi and has only just returned. I have already sent someone to summon them."
As soon as he finished speaking, an old Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer, with a dignified demeanor, entered the hall. He came up, cupping his fist as he greeted, "Rogue cultivator Meng Taizhi greets Family Head."
Li Yuanping acknowledged him with a wave of his hand and then got straight to the point. "No need for such formality, Elder Meng. I heard that you can craft Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts… Is that true?"
Meng Taizhi nodded and replied confidently, "I have some expertise in crafting artifacts and am quite skilled with Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts. If you wish, I can craft such artifacts for your family to offset the cost of gathering Qi."
Li Yuanping smiled and inquired further, "Refining artifacts is no small feat, Elder Meng. How much time can you dedicate to this task?"
Meng Taizhi responded with a bow, "Should your clan provide the materials, producing one artifact every two months is feasible."
Li Yuanping nodded thoughtfully and remarked, "That's sixty artifacts over ten years… That's quite an impressive number."
The Li Family typically acquired dharma artifacts by looting or purchasing them at a high price. These artifacts were crucial for distributing power within the peak's hierarchy and rewarding the younger members. If they could secure this batch of artifacts, it would greatly ease their future endeavors.
Our family possesses Ebony Ores, which are ideal materials for crafting Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts… With these, setting up new offices on future peaks will be more convenient!
Yet, he harbored suspicions about Meng Taizhi's seemingly generous offer and wondered about his ulterior motives. Clutching Xiao Yuansi's letter, he speculated, Meng Taizhi and his daughter could gather qi themselves… Their willingness to assist us might be concealing deeper intentions.
Li Yuanping was reluctant to owe anyone a favor. Glancing at Li Xicheng beside him, he offered a diplomatic smile and said, "It would be improper to trouble you, Senior, especially after your long journey. Fortunately, my family still has some reserves. Perhaps we could commission your services for now and offer some compensation, Elder Meng."
Meng Taizhi cupped his fist and replied, "You're too kind, Family Head. Assisting with such a modest task is hardly a problem. However..."
Having already anticipated the "however" from Meng Taizhi, Li Yuanping waited for him to continue.
"My daughter possesses the talent to conjure core flame necessary for refining pills, but alas, as a lowly blacksmith, I lack the skills to guide her further…"
He bowed deeply and added, "At the age of one hundred and eighty, my years are numbered. My greatest concern is my daughter's future, particularly in securing an alchemy legacy to establish herself… Should we acquire your family's alchemy legacy, we promise to maintain secrecy!"
"Refining a dharma artifact for your family is merely one way to express our gratitude. I'll be happy to help in any way I can, as long as it is within my capabilities!"
So this is his intention!
Feeling a sense of clarity, Li Yuanping placed the letter he had been holding on the desk and spoke calmly, "Elder Meng, there is nothing else my family needs right now. I understand your urgency to secure the alchemy legacy, however, I must consult with the ancestor of my family first."
"Yes, Family Head!" Meng Taizhi said right away, thanking him several times. Li Yuanping inquired about a few more details, discussed unrelated matters briefly, then dismissed him.
Li Xicheng, who had been observing quietly, stepped forward and suggested, "Family Head, given that Elder Meng and his daughter possess unique talents and skills, why not consider recruiting them into our family? Once Meng Zhuoyun attains the status of an alchemist, Brother Ming's burdens will be significantly alleviated..."
"Hmm," Li Yuanping murmured thoughtfully. He gathered the small letters scattered on the desk, sliding them to the corner, and then said, "Take a look at these."
Li Xicheng approached the desk and began to read through the small pile of letters.
"I have reached the Crimson Reef Island Market of the Eastern Sea... there is no alchemist surnamed Meng here... nor have anyone heard of any by that surname leaving the area..."
"I am now at Chunyi Island of the Eastern Sea..."
"I am now at Bamboo Creek Island of the Eastern Sea..."
After Li Xicheng finished reading all the letters, Li Yuanping explained, "I've already sent people to each of the islands to trace the origins of Meng Zhuoyun and other spirit items, but there's no record of any cultivator surnamed Meng skilled in crafting artifacts, nor any recent departures of such cultivator from the Eastern Sea."
"Even the locations Meng Taizhi mentioned led nowhere," Li Yuanping added, tapping the desk.
"His background remains a mystery, making it difficult to trace his origins. Without definitive information about his past, can we just simply recruit him into our family?" he asked, prompting his junior to think.
Seeing the contemplative look on Li Xicheng's face, Li Yuanping continued, "There's no rush. We have a decade to investigate this matter thoroughly. Just stay vigilant and patient, and we'll eventually uncover the truth."
"I've arranged for a team to assist you once you assume leadership of our house. They will methodically follow up on these leads," he said.
Li Xicheng nodded, feeling the weight of his responsibilities. Having observed Li Yuanping navigate similar challenges over the years, he now understood the difficulties his cousin, Li Ximing, had faced.
Although he had only taken over the restructured Li Family, he could already imagine how much harder it must have been for Li Ximing to handle everything in the past.
Just then, a clan soldier approached to report that An Zheyan and his two sons had returned from their survey of the ore vein on the southern shore.
"Excellent! Bring them in immediately," Li Yuanping responded, his spirits lifted as he coughed lightly.
Soon, three men entered the hall together, led by a Qi Cultivator with a shiny shaved head, who was at the ninth heavenly layer.
He cupped his fist and greeted, "An Zheyan greets Family Head!"
Li Yuanping nodded.
Despite looking like a strong bear, An Zheyan's tone was deferential as he continued reporting, "I have completed my investigation on the fourteen anomalies along the southern shore, two were ore veins and seven water veins of high value. Congratulations are in order, Family Head!"
"Two ore veins?!" Li Yuanping exclaimed, rising quickly to his feet.
"What type of ore veins are they?"
