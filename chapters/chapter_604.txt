Li Xuanfeng offered a quiet word of thanks, to which Xiao Yongling responded gravely, "There is no need for thanks, Xuanfeng. If Yu Muxian ascends to the Purple Mansion Realm, there is not a single family that would welcome it. And years ago, the Yu Family competed fiercely with your family, leaving a legacy of resentment with my own as well."
Xiao Yongling continued, "Yu Muxian may appear detached from the world, indifferent even to his own kin, but who is to say this is not a calculated facade? Moreover, Daoist Master Yuanwu and my Xiao Family's ancestors were bitter enemies. Regardless of the circumstances, I will take action."
With their resolve set, Li Xuanfeng said firmly, "Very well. But we do not know when this grotto heaven will close. It would be better to act quickly. Let us forego searching for other treasures."
Xiao Yongling nodded and followed Li Xuanfeng. He gave a quiet warning, "However… Yu Muxian alone is already difficult to handle. Add Tang Shedu into the equation, and the task becomes even more daunting. He has been a well-known figure for years. Just the two of us may not be enough."
Li Xuanfeng had already noted Li Yuanjiao's landing spot earlier. As he walked, the jade pendant at his waist gradually began to glow warmly, dispelling the clouds ahead and revealing a small mountain peak.
On the mountaintop stood two figures, both clad in black. One exuded a dark, brooding aura and stood with an impassive expression, while the other appeared far more imposing, wielding a large golden hammer and seemingly lost in thought.
Li Xuanfeng and Xiao Yongling passed through the mist and immediately came under the detection of spiritual senses. Tu Longjian's gaze flickered as if he understood the purpose of Li Yuanjiao staying in this location. He took a slight step back and remained silent.
Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist in greeting and stepped forward. Xiao Yongling, not bothering with pleasantries, introduced himself softly, "Xiao Yongling of the Xiao Family in Lixia."
Li Yuanjiao returned the gesture respectfully and responded, "So it is the senior Man on Mount Feather..."
However, Xiao Yongling, while observing Tu Longjian standing behind Li Yuanjiao, felt a quiet sense of astonishment. This realization gave him more confidence in the matter at hand. Li Xuanfeng stepped forward and spoke softly, "This cloud sea can obscure spiritual senses. I only saw him heading east earlier. To locate him, we must move quickly."
Without further words, the group ascended into the air. Tu Longjian suddenly spoke up, "Let me search. I have my methods."
Tu Longjian appeared unaffected by the cloud sea's obstruction of spiritual senses. He flew to the forefront, holding the black-and-red token at his waist and focusing intently on the path ahead.
Xiao Yongling considered this and then said softly, "Leave Tang Shedu to me. I can hold him off for a while."
Tu Longjian glanced back slightly and responded in a low voice, "This will not be easy. Yu Muxian carries two Purple Mansion Realm artifacts."
Xiao Yongling's pupils dilated in shock, and he muttered, "Of course, he is Yuanwu's…"
Tu Longjian continued, "Moreover, Tang Shedu, though rarely active in recent years, has advanced greatly in strength and is not to be underestimated. If this succeeds, I want the jade box he carries."
The others agreed readily. However, Tu Longjian seemed deeply uneasy and communicated privately with the token at his waist, You mentioned something strange about Yu Muxian. What do you mean? Could it be he carries a thread of fate?
The token vibrated faintly, its tone laced with frustration, Again with Yuanwu Peak! Damn it, year after year, there is no escaping Tang Yuanwu's shadow... There's definitely something off about Yu Muxian. My divine ability has no effect on him. If you ask me, Tang Yuanwu has likely marked him as some sort of opportunity and is secretly observing him!
No effect? Tu Longjian frowned, murmuring aloud, "Could it be his numerous spirit treasures are shielding him from your divine abilities? Or does he truly bear a thread of fate?"
Absolutely not! Both Guo Shentong and you have a thread of fate, and yet I can still calculate around you two, the token replied gravely. I was forced into hiding in this grotto heaven because of Yuanwu, trapped within the Merging Fire Order for ages. I've long mastered a sliver of its metal essence power, yet I can't discern even the slightest trace of Yu Muxian's origins. He must be linked to something on the level of a Golden Core Realm artifact!"
The token trembled slightly as it added, That's why I warned you not to provoke him. If it weren't for my grudges against Yuanwu Peak, I wouldn't even be advising you. Tang Yuanwu destroyed my physical body, leaving me clinging to life. How could I not hate him?
Tu Longjian mulled over this, sensing the situation's complexity, and asked, "By your reasoning, would the True Monarchs watching over this grotto heaven not have already noticed us?"
The token replied, The Mirrored Mirage Grotto Heaven is no ordinary place. For them to silently observe while the grotto heaven remains unclaimed is already remarkable! How could they possibly calculate anything within the grotto heaven from the outside? Otherwise, how do you think Guo Shentong and Changxiao managed to escape back then? Moreover, things above the Golden Core Realm may appear terrifying to people like us who lack the full picture, but to them, such things are probably no more than minor chess pieces on a grand board.
Tu Longjian lowered his head slightly, using the spirit treasure in his possession to scan the cloud sea ahead. Before long, he detected something in the distance. Turning back to the group, he spoke softly, "Found him!"
Yu Muxian walked with his hands behind his back, moving leisurely through the cloud sea with an air of ease, as though he were completely relaxed. Tang Shedu followed silently behind him, carrying his long halberd.
It was rare for Yu Muxian to appear so at ease. Ever since he was accepted into Yuanwu Peak, he had always cultivated quietly, never revealing himself to others. Decades had passed, and only now did he have a rare moment of relaxation.
When he was young, Yu Muxian did not understand the significance of being personally accepted as a disciple by Tang Yuanwu. At the time, he merely thought that his master's spiritual senses lingering around him was a sign of constant care and attention.
It wasn't until he began reading Daoist scriptures that he realized that someone as inexperienced as an Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivator should not have been able to discern the movements of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's spiritual sense. Watching Tang Shedu break into a sweat and falter in front of Tang Yuanwu, Yu Muxian finally understood that his own resilience was not due to exceptional mental fortitude.
"It is all thanks to this jade buckle!" Gradually, Yu Muxian came to understand its significance, but by then, it was too late. Tang Yuanwu had already noticed that his divine abilities seemed unable to influence this seemingly ordinary child. His vigilance grew sharper, and no matter what Yu Muxian did, Tang Yuanwu's spiritual sense lingered over him like an unshakable shadow.
As a half-grown child, Yu Muxian would likely have crumbled into madness under the silent pressure if not for the jade buckle's calming influence. He relied on its effects to display an outward demeanor of detachment, indifference, and a Dao-centric heart aligned with the heavens.
Fortunately, Yu Muxian's natural talent was exceptional. With the jade buckle enhancing his comprehension, he managed to gradually steer Tang Yuanwu toward a different conclusion—that he was a reincarnated immortal cultivator.
"If this jade buckle had not recognized me as its master and was taken by anyone else… I would have died at Tang Yuanwu's hands long ago." His thoughts darkened. Decades of silent endurance were about to bear fruit. He was nearing the Purple Mansion Realm, and once he stepped into it, he would finally begin to free himself from Tang Yuanwu's control.
"Decades of a blade slicing through my meridians… decades of enduring the daily intrusion of spiritual senses… decades of sitting immobile in meditation within the cave dwelling… Tang Yuanwu…" Yu Muxian's gaze hardened, "When I achieve the Purple Mansion Realm, I will finally be able to establish my own peak under my name, consolidate the Moongaze Lake, plunder and cleanse the other families, and thoroughly uncover the origins of this jade buckle."
