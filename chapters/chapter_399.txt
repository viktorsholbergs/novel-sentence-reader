Xiao Guiluan rode the wind for two full days.
Given the current rise of devil cultivators, the road was unsafe. She took a detour through Mushroom Forest Plain, passing respectfully through a dozen or so immortal mountains of the Yuan Family before making a large loop to reach Xianyou Peak.
Everywhere on Xianyou Peak was draped in white cloth, and Xiao Guiluan could not help but feel deeply sorrowful as she visited various familiar old friends. Many of her childhood playmates had now become minor peak masters, and many were no longer close to her.
The Xiao Family was simply too vast, with many interests and factions. Some old friends had joined different branches and dared not speak much with her for fear of getting involved in conflicts.
Currently, Xiao Guitu was the cultivator managing the Xiao Family, elevating Xiao Guiluan's status as well. In the past, she would have had to wait a long while for her arrival to be reported, but now she was quickly escorted up the main peak with just a brief announcement.
Xiao Guitu, clad in golden armor and playing with a pair of jade rings, sat at the head of the main hall on the main peak. Xiao Guiluan walked on jade tiles, bowed deeply upon entering, and seized the opportunity to observe her brother.
Xiao Guitu looked much somber now, and was at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. His once-smiling face had become impassive, but upon seeing his long-unseen sister, a faint smile appeared. He spoke warmly, "It is rare to see you return."
These words left Xiao Guiluan speechless. Xiao Guitu took two steps down and sat by the side of the stone steps. Only then did Xiao Guiluan notice the small holes covering his golden armor, making it unusable.
Xiao Guitu quietly removed his armor, saying softly, "What a coincidence… Daoist Master Buzi just left, and you arrived."
"Daoist Master Buzi? From Azure Pond Sect?" Xiao Guiluan exclaimed, instantly shocked.
Xiao Guitu tossed the armor piece from his elbow to the ground with a loud clanging sound and replied, "Yes. Since the ancestor has not returned, he has become audacious."
Xiao Guiluan stared blankly at him, her mind racing with thoughts. She could not understand why Xiao Guitu was suddenly behaving unpredictably and being so straightforward with her.
Without looking at her expression, Xiao Guitu continued, "The Li Family must have noticed as well. For something like this to happen at Mount Yu, it shows that the ancestor is not at the peak. With a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator overseeing, how could they dare to use the Mount Yu path? Now, the Yuan Family, Chen Family, and the twenty-eight families affiliated with my Xiao Family are all in turmoil, sending people to inquire and offer condolences… Everyone knows what they are really thinking."
Xiao Guiluan listened attentively while Xiao Guitu looked fatigued and said wearily, "The Daoist Master is merely trapped somewhere in the Eastern Sea… Zhang Tianyuan cannot kill him."
He stared blankly at Xiao Guiluan, seemingly making a resolution. He walked down slowly, a sincere expression as he spoke.
"The Xiao Family has helped your family a lot over the years. The Daoist Master raised your family from obscurity, and Ancestor Yuansi personally handled many matters. Regardless of whether the Li Family has a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator or the Mount Dali demon clan behind them, go to the Eastern Sea to help."
The Li Family has a Purple Mansion behind them?!
Xiao Guiluan was shocked, thinking of the Li Family members' worried expressions which did not match up to having a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's support.
She assumed Xiao Guitu had misunderstood and quickly said, "Brother! The Li Family is utterly impoverished, struggling even to have Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators! How could they have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's protection... this... this..."
Xiao Guitu shook his head and said softly, "Just convey my words to Li Yuanjiao."
Xiao Guiluan paused, then gritted her teeth and agreed. Only then did Xiao Guitu say, "I also know about the situation at Mount Yu. Do not worry, there will not be any problems."
Xiao Guiluan felt that her brother might have misunderstood something, but seeing him so agreeable, she felt relieved and left obediently.
Xiao Guitu watched her departing figure, silently sitting on the jade steps, staring into space.
Does the Li Family have a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind them?
In Xiao Guitu's mind, it was a certainty. There had to be at least one extraordinary Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind the Li Family!
In the past, Xiao Guitu had always felt uneasy about having the Li Family, a formidable force, nearby. He watched as the Li Family conquered the Mount Yue region and two other mountains, and as Li Tongya's swordsmanship astonished everyone. He tossed and turned, unable to find peace.
However, after Xiao Chuting's incident with the Wrathful Maha, leveraging Li Tongya's immunity to divine abilities to intimidate the other Purple Mansion cultivators, Xiao Chuting had returned home and pondered, gradually becoming suspicious. Furthermore, the Mount Dali demon clan staunchly supported the northern family, which quickly led to speculation.
Xiao Guitu had planned to make the Li Family a subordinate through marriage. Before any significant movement occurred, however, Xiao Chuting had summoned him to the mountain. When Xiao Chuting explained his suspicions, Xiao Guitu finally understood.
"No wonder... no wonder the Li Family could rise so rapidly within decades, effortlessly outmaneuvering other families! No wonder both Li Tongya and Li Chejing, starting from humble beginnings, could reach the Foundation Establishment Realm…"
It turned out the Li Family was a hidden asset of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator! The Li Family's meteoric rise was clearly orchestrated by some profound life divine ability. The Li Family was even likely descendants of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, hidden among the common folk, which would explain their exceptional talent!
Li Mutian was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, yet there was no trace of him in the Wu and Yue States, clearly indicating the involvement of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. When Xiao Guitu thought more carefully about the matter, he realized that only two families had caused losses to the Li Family.
Mount Wu killed Li Xiangping, and the Azure Pond Sect killed Li Chejing.
Both incidents pointed to two Purple Mansion Realm cultivators on the verge of breaking through to the Golden Core Realm! It was evident that the Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters were exchanging blows, interfering with each other.
With this calculation, the vague figure behind the Li Family emerged; proficient in manipulating fate, hidden behind the scenes of some sect, at odds with the Azure Pond Sect, and at least in the later stages of the Purple Mansion Realm.
The Purple Mansion Realm cultivator behind the Li Family remained hidden, and the Xiao family dared not expose them. They quietly facilitated the Li Family in the market, supporting them silently.
Now that Xiao Chuting was trapped, Xiao Guitu had nowhere to turn for help. He remembered the silent cooperation between Xiao Chuting and the Li Family's Purple Mansion Realm cultivator—one leveraging power, the other remaining hidden. Thus, he had no choice but to make a risky move and seek help from the Li Family.
"I can only hope I don't anger that Daoist Master... Guiluan is straightforward, it should be fine..." Xiao Guitu mumbled, as he could not help but worry.
Xiao Chuting had been missing for over two years now, and he had only learned from Buzi's mouth that Xiao Chuting was trapped by Zhang Tianyuan. That green-robed Daoist Master had gloated, suggesting that Xiao Chuting's situation was dire.
"Our family has broken away from the Azure Pond Sect… Now, our survival rests on you alone!"
