â€œOld ox, let's go. Let's go to the alchemy hall and take a look. I think these elders seem to need the assistance of foundation-building cultivators."
Chen Xun looked at the big black ox and smiled, "We don't ask for much in return. Just following the senior brothers to learn more about alchemy knowledge is fine."
"Moo~~" The big black ox nodded continuously. They also had tasks in the spiritual medicine garden, and these elders couldn't keep them.
After some preparation, Chen Xun began to lead the big black ox towards the alchemy hall. The people guarding outside the formation didn't pay much attention; as long as it wasn't a distant journey, it was a trivial matter. This place wasn't a prison.
Chen Xun found Elder Jing Huang inside the alchemy hall and expressed his willingness to assist in alchemy without compensation. He offered to lend a helping hand and learn a bit in return.
Oh, this made Elder Jing Huang extremely happy. He kept stroking his beard and said that with Junior Brother Chen Xun's mentality, he was definitely on the path to Golden Core cultivation!
This was truly a windfall. Foundation-building cultivators were busier than Qi-refining disciples, and each one thought highly of themselves. Moreover, they were offering their assistance for free, and Elder Jing Huang didn't even need to provide Chen Xun with the spirit stones to replenish his depleted mana.
Most importantly, he could make use of Chen Xun's powerful spiritual consciousness, which was much more useful than his named disciples. It would undoubtedly greatly increase the success rate of pill refinement.
However, Chen Xun set some ground rules. He had his duties in the medicine garden and couldn't come regularly.
Jing Huang was straightforward as well, stating that they were fellow senior brothers in the alchemy hall and there was no need for formality. He wouldn't force Chen Xun to do anything.
Chen Xun was also delighted. It seemed that things were easier in one department. If he went to some other place, like the artifact-refining hall, he would probably be kicked out...
The rules of the Five Elements Sect were strict, and one couldn't wander around as freely as in a small mountain village.
For half a month, Chen Xun stayed in a certain alchemy room, while the big black ox read books on the side. Jing Huang gave him many low-grade spiritual medicines to refine, and the finished products of the pill liquid were quite satisfying to Jing Huang. They were even more effective than those made by his disciples.
However, Jing Huang never taught Chen Xun any alchemical techniques. This was a legacy, and he only pointed out some alchemical knowledge. Chen Xun was content; he felt it was enough.
For example... Today they were drinking tea in Jing Huang's cave, and Chen Xun's spiritual consciousness was greatly depleted, needing some time to recover. It was the first time Jing Huang invited Chen Xun to his cave.
"Senior Brother Jing, can this foundation-building main-taste spiritual medicine be refined into foundation-building pills more than once?"
Chen Xun was shocked. He might have made a big mistake! He stared at Jing Huang in disbelief, "Doesn't that mean many spiritual medicines can be refined into several pills?"
Jing Huang shook his head and chuckled. Chen Xun seemed to understand nothing, "Of course, the medicinal properties of spiritual medicines are too intense, and it would have a significant impact on pill refinement, including foundation-building pills."
"For example, a spiritual medicine can produce one pill after thirty years, but if you attempt to refine an equivalent pill using a three-hundred-year-old one, what do you think the result would be?"
"Well... the pill's power would greatly increase, right?" Chen Xun thought for a moment and said he had some experience, such as doing such foolish things before.
"Haha, Junior Brother Chen thinks too much. That would only cause the pill to disintegrate. It can't withstand such medicinal power."
Jing Huang laughed heartily. This Junior Brother Chen was indeed interesting. "When the water is full, it overflows; when the moon is full, it wanes; everything has its opposite. The same goes for the spiritual medicines of heaven and earth."
"I see. Thank you for enlightening me, Senior Brother. If it weren't for Senior Brother Jing's guidance, I might have been in the dark forever."
Chen Xun was sweating. The more he thought about it, the more he felt something was wrong. He had really taken too many detours. "I was wondering why the spiritual medicines in the medicine garden aren't allowed to age continuously. The reason is here."
Jing Huang smiled faintly, filled Chen Xun's cup with spiritual tea, and had some things to do. Today's invitation to Chen Xun to come to his cave was also a way of expressing gratitude.
"Senior Brother Jing, then I won't disturb you any longer." Chen Xun stood up, cupped his hands, and escorted his guest out with a full cup of tea.
"Alright, I won't keep Junior Brother any longer. If there are any uncertainties, you can come to my cave for guidance."
Jing Huang nodded calmly. Chen Junior Brother was quite considerate, understanding when to advance and when to retreat. He never delved too deeply into the path of alchemy, only asking about trivial matters.
Chen Xun smiled faintly, turned, and left. He looked at the big black ox outside the cave; it was surrounded by a large pile of wood, appearing thoughtful.
He stopped in his tracks, turned around, and said, "Senior Brother Jing."
"What's the matter, Junior Brother?"
"What are these woods outside? I see many senior brothers have them in front of their caves."
"Hehe, those are the woods from the Crane Spirit Tree, used to make medicine boxes or store pills. Many places in the Jade Bamboo Mountain Range have them."
"What?!" Chen Xun suddenly had bloodshot eyes, roared in disbelief, and collapsed to the ground, his eyes rolling back.
"Chen Junior Brother!"
"Moo!!"
...
On the way, the big black ox carried Chen Xun on its back. The latter stared blankly at the sky, feeling as if ants were crawling all over his body. The anger in his heart kept accumulating, and the mountain-cutting axe at his waist kept flashing with a cold light.
The big black ox kept looking back at Chen Xun. This time, they really suffered. Back in the day, they were so poor that they had to reclaim the medicine boxes even after selling spiritual medicine.
As a result, they were told that as long as the Crane Spirit Tree was in a place with gathered spiritual energy, it could be found everywhere. They had come from difficult times, and the gap in their hearts was beyond description.
"Old ox!" Chen Xun suddenly shouted at the ox's back.
"Moo moo!"
In anger, the man and the ox plunged into the mountains. When they saw the Crane Spirit Tree, it was a swing of the mountain-cutting axe, and the big black ox directly rammed violently, causing constant rumbling in the mountains.
Chen Xun and the big black ox carried a large pile of wood and headed towards the spiritual medicine garden. The passing disciples all showed surprise in their eyes. This senior uncle must be cultivating some kind of wood-based magical technique!
Outside the spiritual medicine garden, the foundation-building cultivators guarding the gate were shocked. What kind of appearance is this?!
They saw a man carrying more than ten round giant trees on his shoulders, and the spiritual beast, the black ox, also carried six or seven. If it weren't for their clear senses, from a distance, it looked like two giant clumps of wood were walking.
"Junior Brother, what are you intending to do?" someone couldn't help but ask. Was he practicing mortal martial arts in the cultivation world?
"Senior Brother, we're fine. Cutting wood helps us clear our minds."
Chen Xun's forehead veins bulged, smiling and nodding, "Old ox, let's go."
"Moo!" The big black ox followed with a low moo.
The two guards, although separated by a considerable distance, shook their heads and sighed as they watched Chen Xun's appearance. People who could cultivate the second layer of the Water Spirit Art were indeed somewhat eccentric in character.
In the days that followed, Chen Xun and the big black ox added a new entertainment activity: logging in the mountains!
Their spiritual medicine garden was filled with wood from the Crane Spirit Tree, piled higher and higher. Their anger became more and more smooth, and they began making various tools. The banging sound echoed through the entire spiritual medicine garden.
Time kept passing swiftly. Chen Xun and the big black ox no longer felt the probing power in the formation, but they still dared not be careless, continuing to silently perform their duties.
