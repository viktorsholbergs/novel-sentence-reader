Li Xijun rose swiftly upon hearing the latest report and rode the wind outside, where Wushao approached him with a hissing voice and reported, "He just left the courtyard."
Fixing his gaze on Xu Xiao, Li Xijun saw him sitting cross-legged, immersed in a bath of crimson medicinal liquid, seemingly preparing for a breakthrough. Li Xijun's heart sank, thinking to himself worriedly, No, I cannot wait any longer! If I let this continue, he might break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in just a few years! By the time the elders return from the vast Eastern Sea, he could already be too powerful. Who knows what methods he'll have mastered by then? And if he slips away unnoticed, it'll be too late… It's better to strike now than regret later!
Without hesitation, Li Xijun waved his hand, "Everyone, gather here!"
He narrowed his eyes, activating both his perception technique and talisman qi to observe the spiritual qi flowing through the medicinal bath. He waited patiently for Xu Xiao to enter the critical stage of his breakthrough.
"When he reaches the tipping point, we will strike together," Li Xijun murmured, his hand already resting on the hilt of the sword at his waist. Behind him, the hem of Li Wushao's robe shifted with an ominous, rolling motion, while the white monkey, Chen Mufeng, and the others stood at the ready, fully prepared for battle.
Li Xijun sighed inwardly, What a mess… Ever since our family achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm and rose to dominate the lake, it has been years since we've had to assemble with such vigilance… and now, all this, just for a mere Qi Cultivator!
Xu Xiao slowly calmed his mind, his breath becoming unsteady as the medicinal liquid in the basin whirled faster and began to dissipate. With the cautionary tales of Chu Yi and the Kong Family still fresh in his mind, Li Xijun dared not be careless. He feared his guest cultivators might also lower their guard, so he repeatedly reminded them, "This person is most likely a reincarnated devil… Who knows how many secret treasures or forbidden techniques he carries? Do not underestimate him! A single lapse could cost us our lives!"
Sure enough, at these words, the expressions of those present grew serious. Even Li Wushao, who had stood stiffly with a stern face, showed a flicker of surprise and increased his vigilance in his gaze toward the figure below.
Xu Xiao's aura surged.
Li Xijun held his breath, waiting for the critical moment to strike.
At the Eastern Sea.
Li Yuanjiao escorted Li Qinghong back to Lake Xian, ensuring she entered the river path leading to the Yue Cultivating Sect before heading eastward again.
Being a cautious person, he did not retrace his steps but instead took a different route with Kongheng to return to Zongquan Island, adding a slight detour while staying safe.
They flew silently for a while, passing a long, pine-covered island. From afar, the skies above were filled with clashing spells and flashes of light, creating an impressive commotion.
Based on his calculations, Li Yuanjiao determined that this location aligned with the notorious Green Pine Temple Ruins. For years, Sword Gate, Chunyi Dao Gate, and Crimson Reef Island had been vying for control over it, yet no resolution had been reached.
As Li Yuanjiao looked toward the ruins, a thought suddenly occurred to him. He turned to Kongheng and asked, "Master Monk, do the records of the Liao River's teachings mention anything about the ancient gate known as Green Pine Temple?"
Kongheng pressed his palms together and replied softly, "Indeed! This immortal temple was founded before Moonlight Origin Mansion… It produced two True Monarchs. The first remains obscure but was known to cultivate in the Fire Virtue system, while the second realized the Swamp Gold attainment but was slain by the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch."
Li Yuanjiao recalled the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch, whose name was linked to Splitreed Island. He nodded and then asked, "So, the legacies of Swamp Gold and Fire Virtue lie within Green Pine Temple?"
"Correct," Kongheng affirmed.
Li Yuanjiao, however, remained skeptical.
"If two True Monarchs emerged from there, how did it fall into the hands of these mere Purple Mansion Realm immortal gates? Would any Golden Core Realm cultivator not be interested in it? Surely, there are True Monarchs attuned to Swamp Gold within the mainland?"
Kongheng nodded and explained, "After the fall of Green Pine Temple, it was plundered by many factions, leaving it a desolate ruin. There are no longer any truly valuable treasures, which is why it is now called the Green Pine Temple Ruins."
Kongheng continued, "However, even if the artifacts are gone, the records of its techniques remain in the hidden realm within it. Moreover, there are ancient spirit herbs cultivated for centuries there, which are of significant value to any sect."
As Li Yuanjiao listened, his gaze returned to the mountain. Following his glance, Kongheng continued in a calm tone, "The Sword Gate covets the Swamp Gold Dao, Crimson Reef Island desires the Merging Fire arts, and Chunyi Gate claims to be the descendants of Green Pine Temple. Naturally, all of them want a piece. The great formation protecting Green Pine Temple remains sealed and has yet to be broken… They are all waiting for the arrival of a predestined person."
"A predestined person..?" Li Yuanjiao repeated thoughtfully, his brows furrowing.
Unwilling to get entangled in the conflict, Li Yuanjiao and Kongheng flew around the mountain. As they passed it, Li Yuanjiao murmured to himself, and Kongheng added, "This is also called fate… a subtle force, inexplicable yet undeniable. Without that destined person, not even Golden Core Realm cultivators can breach it, no matter how fiercely the three sects struggle."
Kongheng paused briefly before elaborating further, "Some formations open only when the destined person passes through it. Some treasures lie buried for millennia, waiting for one specific person to claim them. And some individuals, no matter the danger they encounter, possess foreknowledge and cannot be easily killed—all due to the force of fate."
"Fate is this powerful? Does that not make one invincible?" Li Yuanjiao pondered aloud, taking note of Kongheng's words.
Kongheng responded with a serene expression, "Fate is not a tangible force, much like the metallic essence, which also has limits. Triumph and defeat alike can be attributed to fate. As one scripture puts it: Whatever lies beyond one's strength to achieve, that is fate."
The words of a Buddhist cultivator were always cryptic. Li Yuanjiao pondered for a moment before quietly saying, "In my view, fate and Metallic Essence are very much alike. Both are forces beyond control—something that defies strategy and clouds judgment."
The thought of his elder, Li Tongya, crossed Li Yuanjiao's mind. Kongheng, hands clasped in front of him, chanted softly, "It was not always like this. Back then, whether immortal, devil, or monk, they all pursued absolute freedom. Now that freedom is achieved, this is what we have become."
Ripples shimmered across the turquoise and red surface of the water beneath them. Li Yuanjiao did not respond, instead flew alongside Kongheng quietly. Before long, they arrived at Zongquan Island. The people on the island, seeing the two return, cheered loudly, their joyful voices filling the air.
Once they landed, Zong Yan stepped forward respectfully to greet them. Kongheng murmured a few quiet words before retreating. Li Yuanjiao leaned closer to Zong Yan and instructed in a low voice, "Send out a few trusted men to gather information across the various marketplaces. Choose only the most loyal ones and ensure everything is done discreetly."
Zong Yan bowed deeply and reassured him, "Rest assured, My Lord. Everyone on this island has survived the jaws of monsters. Their loyalty is beyond question."
Li Yuanjiao's tone grew serious, "There is an immortal foundation known as the Molten Metal Cave, capable of sensing artifacts and forging weapons. Investigate which of the Three Gold it belongs to and whether it has any Dao Partners. Report back to me once you know this."
Zong Yan nodded and withdrew. Now having a direction, Li Yuanjiao mulled over his next steps, "The Molten Metal Cave—Azure Pond Sect has no known Dao Partners. Yu Muxian is a proud individual who would never allow his path to be severed. If I can gather information about related techniques and tie them to the Green Pine Temple Ruins, I can surely lure Yu Muxian out."
With the initial steps in place, Li Yuanjiao retreated to a secluded chamber. Activating the room's protective formations, he still felt uneasy. He retrieved a formation plate and meticulously rearranged the setup himself. Only then did he sit down, satisfied, ready to begin his meditation.
"Time to break through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm!"
