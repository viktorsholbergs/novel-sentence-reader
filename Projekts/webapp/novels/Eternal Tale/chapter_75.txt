Chen Xun was about to sing along the road when the big black ox suddenly indicated that it needed to relieve itself. He immediately frowned, wondering what it meant.
He stared at the big black ox on the roadside, and its expression looked unpleasant. After holding it for a while, its black face turned red. Chen Xun squinted slightly, feeling that something was not right the more he looked.
Advancing step by step, Chen Xun approached the big black ox under the tree, holding one of its ears while singing softly, "Listen to me..."
"Moo!!!" The big black ox's face trembled, letting out a shocking and miserable scream, and finally released a thunderous fart.
"Oh my, damn it... Ugh! Ugh! Old Ox, you son of a... Die for me!!"
"Moo!!"
The big black ox ran wildly, looking back as it ran. Its pupils contracted intensely. Chen Xun, carrying a battle axe, was chasing after it, raising dust and emanating a murderous aura!
Countless disciples were frightened and scattered everywhere. This Senior Uncle had a painful expression, and the veins on his forehead were bulging. He was chasing a mad cow!
They only stopped when they reached the entrance of the herb garden. Chen Xun revealed a bloodthirsty smile, nodded to two senior brothers around, then carried the big black ox into the herb garden.
From then on, every day, the Echoing Spring Stream Herb Garden would resonate with a series of ghostly cries and howls, along with the painful screams of a large black cow, as if it were undergoing tremendous torture.
Finally, the days became peaceful. Chen Xun and the big black ox started their formal cultivation, eating their unique Foundation Establishment Pills and absorbing the pure spiritual energy from the spirit veins.
Their cultivation progressed daily, albeit slowly. They remained patient, experiencing each improvement carefully and consolidating their progress through discussions. Even the big black ox had become more adept at writing using the Beast Taming Art.
After ingesting one Foundation Establishment Pill, the next interval could be a month or even several months, not chasing after the lifespan extension of the Foundation Establishment period.
"Old Ox, there are many things to do. Let's follow the cultivation plan and not be in a rush."
"Moo moo~"
Sitting cross-legged on the grassland, their eyes slightly closed, they emitted a profound and mysterious aura. With a calm and composed demeanor, the large green grass around them moved rhythmically without any wind.
Chen Xun and the big black ox also started a disciplined routine. They practiced martial arts, meditated, and breathed in the morning. In Chen Xun's words, the plan for the day is made in the morning, and there is auspiciousness when the purple qi rises from the east with the rising sun.
The big black ox firmly believed in Chen Xun's words and sometimes woke up even earlier than him. After Foundation Establishment, its energy increased significantly, and even its memory improved. They no longer slept as long as they used to.
This novel experience made Chen Xun constantly amazed. The leap in the levels of life was truly comprehensive and terrifying.
In the afternoons, they practiced formations, the art of talismans, or read books. In the evenings, they practiced body techniques and the basic Five Elements Concealment Technique. Occasionally, they took care of the herbs, making their time full and busy.
The wild boars and chickens were kept, but they had no intention of eating them. The herb garden became lively. The big black ox also became the big brother of these animals, taking them for walks every day. Sometimes, it would be greeted by loud moos, and Chen Xun would burst into laughter.
...
Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, two and a half years had passed. Chen Xun and the big black ox had added three longevity points to their cultivation.
The order in the mortal realm of the Qian Nation finally ceased its chaos. After the new emperor ascended the throne, he worked diligently to suppress wrongdoers across the land, and numerous evildoers were beheaded or hanged in the marketplace.
The collision between Wu Nation and Qian Nation has finally come to an end, and both sides are beginning to withdraw their troops. However, countless corpses are left on the border, and the world is shrouded in mourning silence.
But the real clash between the two countries has just begun, transitioning from the mortal realm to the cultivation world. The ten major sects of the Qian Nation are now in turmoil, recalling many cultivators from outside, and the situation seems to be brewing.
In the Five Elements Sect, there are often Nascent Soul stage cultivators soaring into the sky, traversing the air, and disappearing in the blink of an eye. The entire sect is filled with a sense of an impending storm.
However, there is also good news within the sect, such as the successful Foundation Establishment of individuals like Ji Kun, adding a few more pillars to the sect.
Today, a man stood with his hands behind his back outside a cave. His facial features were finely carved, with long, thick, and jet-black hair that gave him a seemingly unrestrained appearance. However, the sharpness revealed in his eyes unintentionally made people not dare to underestimate him.
"Senior Brother Chen, Senior Brother Ox, I have successfully built the foundation. If anyone dares to bully you within the sect, Ji Kun will not rest until he deals with them!"
Ji Kun's aura was strong, with a chilling light in his eyes. The ancient trees around him continuously trembled under the pressure, shedding countless green leaves.
"Suyue Tong... hehe." Ji Kun tilted his head slightly, a hint of resentment flashing in his eyes. Although he had secured a position among the external affairs deacons, that woman was still under the jurisdiction of an elder.
Ji Kun frowned slightly. Killing her was simple, but handling things properly afterward without leaving any trouble behind was troublesome. The external affairs deacon faction was complex and extensive, and he couldn't afford to let people find any evidence like before.
"Senior Brother Chen said that after I build the foundation, I should open this item."
Ji Kun solemnly took out a sachet from his storage bag. Inside was a piece of paper covered with words, which read:
"Congratulations to Senior Brother Ji on successfully building the foundation. However, it's better to resolve conflicts than to harbor grudges. She's just a Qi Refining stage female disciple; there's no need to put yourself in danger. As Foundation Establishment cultivators, we should adhere to sect rules!"
Ji Kun's eyebrows raised as he read this. Senior Brother Chen didn't say this before... He began to waver, wondering if he really should let go of his hatred.
"He said that the elder only believed the slander of that woman back then. Senior Brother Ji, prepare a gift and go to explain the matter properly in the elder's cave. Trust that after Senior Brother Ji builds the foundation, the elder will give you face. We are fellow senior brothers in the same sect, and there's no need to sour the relationship. The road ahead is still long."
Ji Kun's heart twitched, and his frown deepened. Besides Su Yuetong, he hated this person the most. Did he have to go and seek refuge with him?
"But Junior Brother knows that Senior Brother Ji has a strong character. So, no matter what happens, when you arrive at the elder's cave, you must put aside your pride and avoid offending the senior. In the end, Junior Brother hopes that Senior Brother Ji will stick to his original intention and become a rainbow on the path of cultivation. Haha."
Ji Kun finished reading, and his heart quieted down. His gaze became increasingly profound, and the content in Senior Brother Chen's words was filled with kindness, flawless, and very much in line with his character.
Anyone who read the content inside would feel that there was no problem. Even Ji Kun felt the same. He sighed deeply, knowing that Junior Brother Chen was doing this for his own good.
Having received such great kindness from him, even if he let go of his hatred and endured a bit of grievance, what did it matter? He immediately burned the paper and began preparing a gift.
