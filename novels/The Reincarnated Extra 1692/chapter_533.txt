【Beautiful Girl Detective Akashiterika!】The Old Imperial Street Snatching Incident
* * *
Arc 24 begins.
The Old Imperial Capital, Ruinomiyako.
About 700 years ago… This city, which was born at almost the same time as the Superbad Empire, was constructed in an orderly manner, from the beginning, based on strict urban planning. And therefore, it gives travelers a very well-organized impression.
The buildings in the Superbad Empire style, lined up along the streets like walls, are all three stories or higher.
Their heavy, stone walls, now blackened, were once all painted gold… and although that city-wide landscape could be considered gaudy, it still overwhelmed visitors from other countries, demonstrating the power of the Empire.
Due to a very peaceful transition to a republic, this city relinquished its position as the political center to another city, and the gold paint was also discontinued, but it didn’t mean the end of this city.
The Old Imperial Capital, Ruinomiyako, is still the ‘second largest city in the Hirayona Republic’, with a large population and great economic power.
Now then, if you were to ask what is the most popular tourist attraction in the Old Imperial Capital, it would be the Old Superbad Imperial Castle, which was once the residence of the Superbad royal family, and Old Imperial Street, leading to it.
This main street, where you can see the huge Old Superbad Imperial Castle up close, with numerous spires towering towards the sky, is now a major commercial area, with various stores lining the street.
Carrytopopolock, horses, and carriages pulled by Powerful Bunbuns run along the stone pavement, with its unevenness shaved off to the extreme, and many tourists, looking around curiously, walk on the sidewalks lined with neatly planted street trees…
It’s a bustling street.
In other words, this street, filled with so much hustle and bustle, with so many excited people walking around…
“Kyaaaaーーー!? A snatcherーーー!!”
…Is, unfortunately, for some criminals, a very easy place to work! A hunting ground!
“Someone! Someone, catch that manーーー!!”
The female tourist, whose bag was snatched from behind, shouts, falling, and kneeling on the ground!
“That bag is a precious, precious bag made by the craftsmen of ‘Atelier Ijiwaar’, a new and up-and-coming brand that’s rapidly growing on the Golden Continent, using the finest tea dragon leather, treated with numerous magical processes, worth at least 2 million Eéns! It was a gift from my darling! Someone, get it backーーー!!”
She shouts, desperately reaching out her right arm!
“Heh, hehe! After hearing such a grand explanation, there’s no way I’m getting caught!”
But this snatcher is incredibly fast!
His running, enhanced with 【Body Strengthening】, isn’t something you can learn overnight… Could he be a former adventurer!?
“Out of the way! Move it!”
“Wah!?”
“Hyaa!?”
The snatcher runs through Old Imperial Street, knocking people aside with tackles!
If he runs a little further, he’ll reach an intersection.
Once he turns the corner, the tall buildings of the Old Imperial Capital will block the view, and he’ll be able to disappear into the crowd, and complete his job.
Then he can sell his loot on the black market, and live a debauched life, indulging in alcohol for a while!
A smile involuntarily appears on the snatcher’s face!
But, however!
“Aah…!? Who the hell are you!? Get out of the way, if you don’t want to get hurtーーー!!”
Someone… appeared, blocking the snatcher’s escape!
The person, who calmly emerged from behind a corner, is slender.
He’s fairly tall, but probably a child.
He’s wearing a white, short-sleeved shirt, and shorts, held up by suspenders.
He’s wearing a newsboy cap on his head…
Just hearing that, you might think he’s a boy, but he’s not.
Glossy, orange hair, reaching down to his waist.
A large ribbon, tying it together around his neck.
In other words, yes, it’s a girl.
The one standing before the snatcher, who’s sprinting… is a girl, who can be described as delicate!
“Th-That’s dangerous!?”
“Run away, little girl!!”
But whether he’s a boy or a girl… that slender physique is definitely not enough to stop a dangerous criminal from escaping!
Many of the people watching, predicting that the girl would be knocked aside by the snatcher, involuntarily covered their eyes!
However, that prediction was soon overturned!
“Superbad Style Martial Arts…”
The girl muttered something, and instead of running away… she crossed her arms, puffed out her chest, glared at the snatcher, and unleashed her 【Intimidation】!
Her blue-green eyes, half-hidden under the brim of her newsboy cap, gleamed!
“D-Don’t underestimate meーーー!? 【Snatcher Tackle】ーーー!!”
The snatcher, although slightly intimidated by her 【Intimidation】, leaned forward, assuming a tackling stance!
The same tackle he used to knock aside the passersby earlier!
The distance between the girl and the snatcher quickly closed, and the moment they collided—
“【The Grumpy Emperor’s Entrance】!!”
The girl, who had been completely still, with her arms crossed, moved!
She took a step forward, keeping her back straight, and sharply!
Sharply thrust out her right leg!
Her white, long legs, extended parallel to the ground, are strengthened by magical power, as hard as steel!
That leg!
The sole of her shoe, reinforced with a magic ore plate!
Slipped easily into the snatcher’s core, and attacked his… his… well, his male-specific weak point!
“Guh-GYAAAAAAAAHーーー!?”
The snatcher screamed from the incredible pain, and was blown away by the force of the kick, rolling on the stone pavement!
The stolen bag was thrown out of his hands, spinning in the air…
But!
The girl’s attack doesn’t stop there!
“【The Emperor Crushes Even Ants With All His Might】!!”
The girl shouted that, and jumped high, with her arms still crossed!
Keeping her back straight, she beautifully spun in the air, and then forcefully stomped on the stomach of the snatcher, writhing in pain…!
“AGAAAAAAAHーーー!!”
The snatcher, neglecting the protection provided by 【Body Strengthening】 because of the intense pain in his lower abdomen, had no way to resist this powerful stomping attack.
After letting out a tremendous scream, he immediately… foamed at the mouth, rolled his eyes, fainted, and let his body limp.
“““““OOOOOOOOOHーーー!!!”””””
Cheers erupted from the surrounding people!
“Heave-ho.”
Now, the girl, catching the stolen bag that had fallen from the sky, walked over to the woman, the victim of the snatching, who was still on her knees, unable to get up.
Her back straight, her walking posture exuding elegance.
And then, approaching the woman, she knelt down on one knee, and took the woman’s hand.
“Madam, are you alright?”
Smiling, she brought her face closer.
Her sharp, dignified eyes narrowed gently.
Her skin is dazzlingly white.
And because she’s bringing her face closer… she can smell this… really nice fragrance…!
“Haa!? Ha-hahaha, yes!!”
The woman, dazed by the girl’s beautiful smile, and her noble aura, blushed… but quickly regained her senses, and jumped to her feet.
“I’m so glad you’re okay. Here.”
“Ah… Thank you!”
The woman, although still staring at the girl’s face, dazed, after receiving her stolen bag, suddenly realized—
That she still doesn’t know her savior’s name.
So she hurriedly asked!
“Um…! What’s your name!?”
“I was waiting for you to ask that!”
The girl, her voice happy, said that, and moved away from the woman slightly.
“I am… the envoy of justice, who will not tolerate injustice!”
And she shouted, raising both hands high in the air, an ecstatic expression on her face!
“And the seeker of truth… who never overlooks wrongdoing!”
And then she spun around once, and then stopped, striking a pose, her hand on her chin, and shouted!
…At this point, the audience, including the victim—
(……Hmm?)
(Huh?)
(What’s with this girl, she’s a little weird?)
—Thought that, but they kept quiet, reading the mood.
“My… my… name… isーーー…”
And the girl, ignoring the fact that the mood was getting colder and colder, continued to change her poses, moving her arms and legs briskly… and finally!
“The Beautiful girl detective! Akashiterika!!”
She declared her name, boldly striking a pose with her arms crossed!
“““““…………”””””
The audience, unable to reconcile the gap between the girl… Akashiterika’s brave appearance of fighting off the snatcher thief, her graceful appearance of extending her hand to the woman, and her silly introduction just now, simply stared at her dumbfounded and speechless.
Akashiterika, on the other hand, seemingly satisfied that so many people heard her name, nodded, smiling.
“Everyone! If you’re in trouble! If you have a problem that needs to be investigated! If there’s a murder! Please, by all means, contact Akashiterika! The Akashiterika Detective Agency! I will never tolerate the injustice that assails you!”
She carried out PR activities for her own detective agency.
“““““…………”””””
Akashiterika’s voice echoed clearly, through Old Imperial Street, where the audience was still silent.
“Myogo myomyo, shuushugo myogoーーー…”
A Myogomyogoshugo, perched on a street tree, is chirping.
Looking up, she saw a beautiful blue sky.
And behind the Old Superbad Imperial Castle, visible in the distance, are towering cumulus clouds.
The occasional breeze, caressing her skin, is pleasant.
It’s summer.
【Ijiwaar】
Refers to Ijiwaar Deswaar, the daughter of Duke Deswaar.
Her name has been mentioned since Arc 5, but she has yet to make an appearance in the main story.
【Myogomyogoshugo】
An insect similar to a cicada, widely distributed throughout the world of Ardyst, the setting of this work, ‘The Reincarnated Extra’.
They chirp noisily in summer in regions with four seasons, and all year round in regions with high temperatures.
Because their chirping is loud and unpleasant, they are classified as monsters—beings that harm humans.
Their chirping varies depending on the region.
Appeared since Arc 2.
