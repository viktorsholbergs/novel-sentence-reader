Li Xijun arranged the family matters before reviewing everything that had transpired during his seclusion. There had been no significant issues. The family's income had slightly tightened due to the increasing number of cultivators, but the shortfall was no more than one or two spirit stones—a minor concern.
"Not bad… Brother Xicheng is managing the household with increasing stability," Li Xijun remarked approvingly. Standing at the side of the hall was Chen Donghe, clad in jade armor, his hair entirely white. He had been stuck at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm for years, his swordsmanship gradually reaching a deeper level. However, lacking the confidence to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, he had devoted more of his time to clan affairs.
The former leader of the Jade Court Guard, Chen Mufeng, had been demoted, leaving the elderly Chen Donghe to take charge. Within the family, only he held the reputation and ability to manage such responsibilities. After reading through the records, Li Xijun suddenly asked, "Has there been an increase in female attendants on Mount Wutu?"
Having been in seclusion for some time, Li Xijun was unaware of Li Ximing's recent progress and found no mention of it in the records. Curious, he asked the question, to which Chen Donghe replied, "Mount Wutu sent the previous attendants down the mountain years ago. No new ones have been brought up since, not even the An Family has been there more than a few times."
Li Xijun was surprised and thought to himself, This Brother Ming! What's gotten into him?
Dismissing the elder, Li Xijun soared into the air and descended onto Mount Wutu.
The fire vein on Mount Wutu had been active for over a decade, gradually stabilizing. Day and night, fiery baleful qi spewed forth, transforming the entire mountain. Vegetation had grown sparse, birds circled warily overhead, and jagged rocks jutted out across the landscape. The atmosphere was stiflingly humid.
Li Xijun broke through the formation and landed at the summit. The mountaintop gleamed with resplendent golden halls, radiating opulence. Before the white jade stairs stood two guards, silently on watch.
"Greetings, Clan Uncle," they said respectfully.
Both were youths from collateral branches, raised within the family's cave dwellings. Lacking talent, they had been assigned to cultivate the Guardian of the Courtly Path, quickly reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm but advancing no further.
After their respectful salute, Li Xijun asked, "Is Ximing refining pills?"
One of the guards went to inquire and soon returned, reporting, "The elder is already waiting in the hall."
Li Xijun nodded and entered. Passing through several corridors, he arrived at the main hall.
Compared to the gilded and ornate exterior, the interior of the hall was understated and elegant, with only a few pots of orchids placed as decorations. Li Ximing, looking even younger than Li Xijun, sat in the hall in golden robes, holding a small jade cauldron in his hands.
Li Xijun sat down across from him as Li Ximing smiled and said, "Ah, Xijun, you are here. I was just pondering medicinal principles."
Looking closer, Li Xijun realized that the jade cauldron in Li Ximing's hands was a dharma artifact, currently roasting a spirit herb inside. It seemed he was preparing for alchemy.
"I see," Li Xijun murmured. On his way in, he had noticed the quietness of the mountain, devoid of pavilions or other ornamental buildings. Most of the spaces were dedicated to storing various spirit herbs. Nodding slightly, he remarked, "I thought this place would be filled with birds and butterflies, but it turns out to be a wonderful retreat for cultivation."
At this, Li Ximing gave a faintly exasperated smile and said softly, "Since I broke through to Foundation Establishment Realm, such things are meaningless. Unless the other party is also at the Foundation Establishment Realm, none of it is useful. And since it is of no use, I cannot be bothered to waste time on it."
"No wonder," Li Xijun said in realization. His gaze swept over the hall's sparse decorations. Using the white cloth on the table, he wiped his hands and asked, "How are the pills coming along?"
Li Ximing had already prepared for this. He took out a small white jade bottle from his robes and placed it on the table, saying softly, "These are Three Aspects Breaking Spirit Pills, meant to aid Qi Cultivators in breaking through. I made this batch especially for you. You can take them and use them as needed. There are six pills in this bottle. If you do not use them all, you can distribute the rest to the family members."
Years ago, Li Xizhi had sent back two precious alchemy recipes: the Three Aspect Breaking Pill and the Two Ways of Refining Renewal Spirit Pill. Both were exceedingly difficult to refine and highly valuable. The Three Aspect Breaking Pill even had variants for Qi Cultivation and Foundation Establishment Realms.
Li Xijun nodded and accepted the bottle. Li Ximing then took out another jade bottle, this one green, and said, "This is a Three Aspect Breaking Profound Pill, meant to assist Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in breaking through. I barely managed to refine this one."
Li Xijun hesitated for a moment and then said softly, "Keep it for yourself. How much did it cost you?"
Li Ximing answered with slight embarrassment, "The materials required for these pills are extremely precious. Refining these Qi Cultivation Realm spirit pills cost me nineteen spirit stones in total. As for the Foundation Establishment Realm Profound Pill, I was lucky to succeed on the first attempt, but it still cost nearly thirty spirit stones..."
After summing up the total in his head, Li Ximing continued, "As for the Two Ways of Refining Renewal Spirit Pill, it is even more challenging. I wasted more than a dozen spirit stones without producing anything worthwhile. Even the simpler formulas are hard to perfect, let alone that one..."
The path of alchemy was always like this. Each type of pill required significant initial investment. In the past, with the selfless guidance of Xiao Yuansi, everything had been much smoother. Now that he was researching on his own, the expenses had naturally increased.
Li Xijun felt a pang at the thought of such costs, but he still nodded in encouragement, "To succeed on your first attempt is already commendable. There will be more opportunities in the future."
This matter reminded Li Xijun of something, and he added, "Senior Xiao Yuansi was very kind to you, selflessly teaching you all those years ago. Have you kept that in your heart? Now that you have broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm, both emotionally and ethically, you should pay him a visit."
Li Ximing, still preoccupied with the methods for refining the pills, snapped to attention at these words. Startled, he nodded repeatedly, "You are absolutely right, absolutely right! I almost forgot and nearly fell into the trap of ingratitude! I will pack up and head to the Xiao Family right away."
Li Xijun nodded and updated him on recent events. He then took out two jade bottles, one large and one small, and said, "While you were in seclusion, our aunt returned from overseas and brought back some Yuwa Stone Liquid and three Profound Tempering Pills—treasures only the direct lines of immortal sects can afford."
With a hint of joy, he added, "For some reason, my cultivation speed has significantly increased since reaching Foundation Establishment Realm. With these resources, and after taking the Profound Pill, my progress will only accelerate further."
Li Xijun congratulated him with a smile, his mood greatly improved. After chatting a little more, he excused himself and departed.
Li Ximing, holding the jade cauldron in his hands, calculated the time and dared not delay. He immediately mounted the wind and flew off from Mount Wutu, heading toward the Xiao Family.
The Eastern Sea, Qunyi Strait.
The overcast skies that had loomed over the Eastern Sea for years had finally begun to clear. Though thunderstorms and dark clouds remained more frequent between the various seas, most of the waters were now bright and sunny.
The Qunyi Strait stretched endlessly, linking together a series of islands. Apart from the deep-sea region of Lizhou, this area had the densest population, with long, narrow islands connected in a continuous chain amid turbulent waters.
The once-bright sky gradually darkened as clouds gathered overhead. Two beams of light descended from the north, landing on a small island.
Leading the way was a middle-aged man clad in golden armor and robes, standing with his hands clasped behind him. The second figure, bathed in purple light, resolved into a female cultivator wearing jade armor and wielding a spear. She stood atop thunderclouds for a moment, gazing at the darkening sky.
