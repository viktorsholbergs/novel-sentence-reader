Morning.
The morning sunlight climbed the stone steps in segments, casting a golden hue over the two stone beasts at the entrance. The Li Family had commissioned artisans to craft these statues in the likeness of the Hooked Serpent, Li Wushao. The beast’ tails coiled tightly while its head held high.
Li Zhouwei emerged from the central hall, his brocade-lined golden boots clicking crisply against the ground. With a hand resting on the sword at his waist, he had matured significantly over the past few years. The innate aura he once carried had been restrained, no longer striking fear into those who beheld him.
Even the brilliance in his eyes had gradually faded, transforming into a distinctive shade of deep brown. The once-intimidating presence had seemingly vanished. He stepped forward lightly, and only in fleeting glances did a trace of cunning surface. Occasionally, his movements revealed a swiftness and agility that left others startled, making it hard to believe he was just a boy of eleven.
Chen Yang, clad in black armor, followed behind him. Li Zhouwei had grown taller over the years, now nearly matching his height. His expression remained unreadable as he silently trailed along. Upon reaching the main hall, he instinctively stopped outside and allowed Li Zhouwei to enter alone.
Li Chengliao was seated at the upper end of the hall, reading a letter. Seeing him approach, he smiled and said, "Wei’er, you’re here."
Li Zhouwei was now eleven years old and had reached the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Unlike other direct descendants who were sent to the mountain for cultivation, the Li Family had kept him focused on training halberd arts in the central hall. They feared that advancing too quickly would result in a weak foundation.
Yet, despite the lack of visible effort, he had recently spent a few days in seclusion and broken through to the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. His cultivation was progressing steadily and methodically.
Draped in a wolf-fur cloak, he exuded an imposing presence as he asked, "How are your eyes now?"
Seated firmly, Li Zhouwei answered, "It doesn’t turn gold if I do not make a move or lose my temper."
"Good," replied Li Chengliao.
Li Chengliao couldn’t quite understand how he had managed it but chose not to press the matter. Instead, he picked up a jade-bound cultivation manual from the desk and said softly, "Your uncle Xizhi recently returned home and obtained this perception technique for you. Take a look at it first."
Li Zhouwei strode forward and carefully took the manual. On its cover, the title read, The Grand Veined Golden Eyes
.
Since Li Chengliao had suggested taking a look first, Li Zhouwei gently flipped through the pages in the hall and read it, "In the autumn of the fifth year of Wuming, I visited my friend Xuandou and met Yang Jinxin, a judge of hell. We had an engaging discussion, realizing that clarity and obscurity differ greatly, making true appearances difficult to perceive. Thus, I devised certain eye techniques and recorded them here…"
The introduction detailed the origins of the technique, followed by an extensive exposition of its practice. It primarily instructed on refining golden pupils by tempering the eyes with mana. A process that, in ancient times, required only twenty years to complete.
The best results could be achieved by acquiring a spiritual qi known as Bright Eve Qi, which would then significantly shorten the training period. Upon closer inspection, the final inscription bore the name Cui Yan.
Li Zhouwei glanced briefly at it, while Li Chengliao softly explained, "I have inquired about Cui Yan. It is said that he was a Golden Core cultivator of the Zhaoyuan Immortal Mansion in the Wei State, known as True Monarch Shangyao. This perception technique was likely created in his early years. It is not of high grade and it’s only third-rank. But it should be good enough to conceal your eyes."
As Li Chengliao spoke, he motioned for Li Zhouwei to sit down and continued, "Only techniques obtained from these grotto heavens come with such detailed records of their origins. If this were an ordinary Jiangnan spell, would it even have a signature? Most of them have long since been lost to time."
Seeing Li Zhouwei nod in understanding, he picked up a book and a jade slip from the table and said softly, "As for this, it is a halberd art that elder Xuanfeng acquired from overseas. It was originally recorded within this jade slip, but since you have not yet developed spiritual sense, I have transcribed it for you. There is a copied version and the original, and both are included."
Li Zhouwei received it carefully and offered a formal bow in gratitude, saying, "Thank you, Father."
He glanced at the cover of the halberd manual, which read, The Armor Cycle Soul-Refining Halberd Art
Rather than immediately reading the book in the grand hall, Li Zhouwei changed the topic and asked, "I know a little about the history of the Great Wei, but only in fragmented accounts. How many True Monarchs were there? Has the family gathered any information?"
Li Chengliao was somewhat surprised by the sudden inquiry but responded, "Our family has learned some details over the years. In ancient times, Golden Core cultivators roamed the world, and Dao Embryos cultivators walked freely. The inland regions were several times larger than they are today, and the overseas territories were dozens of times greater. The Wei State produced several True Monarchs. Two from the Cui Family, one of whom was Shangyao Cui Yan. As for the Li Family, we had the Great Ancestor and the Yuan Emperor…
Li Zhouwei interjected, "Four True Monarchs."
Li Chengliao nodded in agreement and continued in a low voice, "After the Wei State fell, the succeeding states of Qi, Liang, Zhao, and Yan had emperors with progressively weaker cultivation. By the end, only Emperor Zhaowu of Zhao State had reached the level of a True Monarch. As for the present day, the state has fractured into regional divisions. There are no longer any so-called immortal states."
Li Zhouwei listened and nodded slightly. Seeing that he was lost in thought and had no intention of asking further, Li Chengliao smiled and said, "Let me introduce someone to you."
As his words fell, a wisp of gray mist rose from the side of the hall, swirling before taking the form of a man in gray robes. His face was sharp and menacing, and he knelt on one knee, speaking in a hoarse voice, "Wushao greets the heir."
Li Zhouwei nodded in return, while Li Chengliao said, "This is Senior Wushao, a cultivator at the mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. The family has specially assigned him to protect you."
For years, Li Wushao had been cultivating at the bottom of the lake, gradually gathering demons at the Qi Cultivation Realm as his subordinates to oversee the lake for him. This allowed him to avoid daily management tasks, appearing at the lake only occasionally. Originally, he had followed Li Yuexiang. But now that Li Xizhi had come to take his sister away, Li Xijun had ordered him to come down from the mountain.
Li Zhouwei gestured for him to rise. Li Wushao gave a crisp salute without a word and quickly faded into the shadows of the hall. The young heir observed him carefully for a moment before looking up at Li Chengliao and asking, "It seems the family has matters arranged."
"Indeed." Li Chengliao said, "You are growing older. When your great uncle Yuanping was your age, he had already assumed leadership of the family. You also possess the Bright Yang Dao Lineage and there are few true talents in the main family. This means that you will undoubtedly take on the household’s responsibilities in the future."
"I plan to choose a location in Mount Yue. You will take some troops there, and this will be a good opportunity to train your halberd arts. When the time comes, you will experience bloodshed firsthand."
The Li Family had always upheld this tradition of succession. Neither father nor son showed any surprise. Li Zhouwei nodded, tucking the items into his sleeve as he prepared to leave. Just then, Li Chengliao called out to him.
The young head, who was draped in wolf fur and exuding an innate charisma, smiled faintly and said in a soft voice, "After careful deliberation, the family has chosen to uphold tradition—not to address you by name, but to bestow upon you a Dao title… or rather, a noble title."
Li Zhouwei raised his brows with interest, a hint of cunning flashing in his eyes as he smiled and asked, "What title has the family chosen?"
Li Chengliao appeared pleased, laughing heartily twice before carefully writing down two characters on a piece of xuan paper. He lifted it gently and said, "Minghuang[1]."
Li Zhouwei narrowed his eyes slightly, resting a hand on the sword at his waist and tilting his chin downward. His expression was not so much one of satisfaction as it was a sense of ease, like a beast discovering a suitable cave to rest in.
"Hmmm," the teen mused before bursting into a resonant laugh, the light in his eyes flickering in sync with his voice.
The grand hall gradually filled with the fragrant scent of peonies, accompanied by the soft rustling of fluttering wings.
Buzz… buzz… buzz…
The golden morning sun climbed the stone steps even faster now, slithering like a serpent as it weaved through the grand hall. Its brilliance intensified, radiating with such dazzling light that Chen Yang, who was standing outside, had to shut his eyes against the glare.
1. The characters used are 明煌 which means Bright Radiant. It can also mean wise and dazzling. I assume it has something to do with his cultivation because these characters are present in the Bright Yang Pass and Radiant Essence Scripture. Time will tell as to what it truly means ☜
