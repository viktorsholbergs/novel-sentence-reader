The Ambition of the Barnacle……!!
* * *
<Obtained the power of god……>
<<<Eventually rule the entire world……>>>
“The…… king of barnacles……!?”
……What is this thing saying!?
<<<Tsuboboobobo……! In other words, I, who am the barnacle among barnacles, the lord of all things, am a natural superior being to the likes of you, isopods and lowly land creatures, and a great barnacle that you should bow your heads and worship!>>>
……What is this thing saying!?
<<<Tsubobo…… You don’t understand? Truly…… there are too many ignorant and unenlightened ones like you in this world…… Therefore, I must teach and enlighten them. Barnacles should be the rulers of the world, and the expanding universe will eventually converge into barnacles!>>>
……What is this thing saying!?
<<<Now, let me enlighten you! You too shall become the vanguard of the glorious new world of barnacles! Tsubobooo!!!>>>
“!?”
It was the next moment!
The arrogantly rambling nonsense Garozg, while laughing wickedly, quickly swung its cirrus and threw something at us with a clatter!
“Tch!”
My right side hurts, so I can’t move my right arm freely!
Inevitably, I have to defend against that something with only my left arm, and some of that something hit my body with a thud.
However, there’s no pain.
What in the world is it?
When I move my neck and direct my gaze towards that something attached to my body.
It was…… tiny, tiny barnacles.
“What are you trying to do……!?”
Not understanding Garozg’s intention, I unintentionally become dumbfounded.
However, this was…… the first move of Garozg’s fearsome attack!
<<<Barnacle, barnacle……>>>
“!?”
The next moment, an eerie thought echoes throughout my mind!
<<<BarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnacleBarnacles>>>
That thought, which sounded like a whisper at first, gradually increases in volume and fills my head with barnacles!
<This is barnacle barnacle brainwashing barnacle! BarnaclebarnaclebarnacleEmibarnaclebarnaclebarnacle!?>
Ah, filled with barnacles, I can’t even hear Extra-sama’s words properly!
At this rate, it’s bad!
I try to peel off the barnacles attached to my body somehow, but my body…… won’t move……!!
<<<Barnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnaclebarnacle>>>
<<<Nuooooh! 【Mucus】!!!>>>
But at that moment, I faintly heard Zaratopu’s shout from the other side of the barnacle chorus.
At the same time, my body is enveloped by something slimy.
I recognized this sliminess.
This is the sliminess that Zaratopu secreted from its entire body to escape from me when I tried to strangle it to death when I first met Zaratopu!
<<<Tsubobo……>>>
<<<Tsubobo……>>>
<<<Tsubobo……>>>
And it seems this sliminess is poison to the barnacles…… they quickly die and fall off my body with a plop, plop.
“…………”
I open and close my left hand to check its movement.
My body…… moves!
<A-Are you okay, Emi!?>
I can clearly hear Extra-sama’s voice too.
It’s okay, it’s okay, Extra-sama, I’m fine now, don’t worry.
I don’t want a repeat of what happened in that village……!
“Zaratopu, you saved me. That’s amazing.”
<<<It’s nothing! It’s a specialty of Great Sea Serpents!>>>
Zaratopu, happy to be praised by me, let out a cheerful “pyuru pyuru” cry.
<<<Hmph…… You refuse my rule. You are fools to forfeit the right to merge with barnacles in happiness.>>>
Looking at us who endured the brainwashing attack, Garozg swung its cirrus in displeasure.
<<<As I thought, that isopod is troublesome. It prevents my followers from attaching. That’s why I had my knights drive it away.>>>
“Knights…… could it be, you mean that giant shrimp and giant squid?”
<<<That’s right. I went through the trouble of making them submit to me and favoring them, but they were useless despite their huge size.>>>
<I see, so this is what happened.>
Here, Extra-sama begins to organize the truth behind this incident based on the information obtained so far.
<Barnacle Garozg, who aims to build a new world of barnacles, tried to take in Zaratopu, who caught its eye, as a fighting force. However, the mucus of Great Sea Serpents is a deadly poison to barnacles. Therefore, it gave up on controlling it and switched to attacking using shrimp and squid, driving Zaratopu out of this sea area.>
Because of that, Zaratopu, who fled to near the shore, met the residents of Panemo Village and started demanding dried fish……
<In other words, the mastermind behind this incident is>
You don’t even need to sort it out anymore to understand.
That…… arrogant barnacle!
<<<Both my knights and followers have been repelled. At this point, I have no choice but to admit it. You are obstacles to my path of supremacy!>>>
“!!”
“Pyuru!?”
Then, here.
The moment Garozg said that!
A violent amount of magical power was released from Garozg!
At the same time, the surrounding sea surface begins to swirl with Garozg at the center!
<<<W-We’re retreating!>>>
Zaratopu instantly decides to retreat!
It changes direction and starts moving away from Garozg with all its might!
<<<Be honored and proud! You have been recognized as my enemies! Therefore, I shall personally…… strangle you to death!!>>>
DOPPAAAAAAAHN!!
A roaring sound echoes from behind us as we retreat!
When I hurriedly look back, what was there was a pillar of water so huge that it surpassed the giant shrimp and giant squid.
That sky-piercing water pillar, probably formed by Garozg’s vast magical power, not only doesn’t collapse according to gravity, but…… keeps increasing in size.
Furthermore, two giant arms start growing from the upper part of the water pillar, and eventually…… it transforms into a super giant water giant with Garozg crowned on its head like a crown!!
A water giant in the form of its upper body protruding from the sea surface.
Its body seems to be able to transform quite freely.
The water giant creates a large mouth on its flat face without eyes or nose.
And.
“BUOOOOOOH!!”
It lets out a loud roar of intimidation!
The sea trembles with a jolt!
