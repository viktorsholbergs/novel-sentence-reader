Fei Family, Glacial Cloud Peak.
Glacial Cloud Peak was the tallest peak on the northern shore, brimming with spiritual qi and covered with pines and cypresses.
The Fei Family had entrenched themselves here for countless years, fortifying the area like an iron fortress. With Fei Wangbai presiding, even late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators would find it hard to break through.
The peak was completely covered by snow that sparkled across the landscape all year round.
Fei Tongxiao had already condensed the third chakra of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Agile and nimble, he left no footprints in the snow. After running for a while, a small courtyard appeared before him, freshly painted in white. Two pots of wintersweet were planted by the door, gently swaying in the breeze.
Fei Tongxiao exhaled lightly, stopping carefully on the stone steps in front of the gate. After tidying his attire, he knocked twice on the door and called out clearly, "Sister Qinghong!"
After two breaths, the courtyard gate creaked open and a girl about fifteen or sixteen stepped out. She was dressed in white, and her smile was as beautiful as the crescent moon in autumn. Her forehead glistened with a hint of sweat and a white cloth belt cinched her waist, preventing her flowing robes from snagging her long spear, while still highlighting her slender figure.
"Junior Brother!"
Li Qinghong's bright eyes met Fei Tongxiao's gaze, causing him to lower his head as if he had been scalded. He could only focus on Li Qinghong's white-furred brown deerskin boots as she planted her spear firmly on the ground.
"Are you here to practice spearmanship with me?" she asked with a smile.
Fei Tongxiao nodded obediently. Seeing Li Qinghong smiling warmly, he could not help but smile back and said softly, "Sister Qinghong, did something good happen to you?"
Li Qinghong playfully grabbed his hand and led him into the courtyard, crunching the snow beneath their feet.
She laughed as she replied, "Yesterday, I broke through to the Jade Capital Stage and awakened my spiritual sense! I have now reached the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm!"
Fei Tongxiao could only feel the warmth of her hand. Li Qinghong had just finished her spear practice and was still radiating heat, leaving Fei Tongxiao blushing and dazed as he followed her into the courtyard. It took several breaths for him to react after she let go.
"The Jade Capital Stage?! Sister Qinghong, it's only been three years since you came to Glacial Cloud Peak, and you were only at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm then... Breaking through two stages in three years is truly impressive!" the boy commended, his shyness now replaced with awe.
Li Qinghong chuckled lightly and replied, "Junior Brother, you started two months later than me, yet you're still at the third stage… You must work harder!"
"I'm no match for Sister Qinghong!" Fei Tongxiao said humbly as he smiled, nodding.
Li Qinghong grasped her spear and twirled it around with a playful smile.
"I want to spar with you again. I'll use only the power of the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm so it'll be fair."
The red tassel swayed as her spear moved like a dragon, aiming straight at Fei Tongxiao.
In the past three years, Fei Tongxiao had sparred with Li Qinghong countless times. Her lower stance was nimble, and her spearmanship leaned toward the softer style.
Fei Tongxiao thrust his spear forward, using force to counter her finesse, parrying her spear aside before pushing his spear back toward Li Qinghong.
Li Qinghong had studied under Fei Wangbai for three years. Although she had not learned the Fei Family's prized Grade Three technique, Dragon Reflection, she had mastered most of the other spear moves.
While her spearmanship wasn't yet outstanding, she was competent in a fight. She stepped back, her spear rising like a venomous snake as it lunged at Fei Tongxiao.
Fei Tongxiao stepped aside to dodge Li Qinghong's spear, switching from a thrust to a sweep aimed at her legs.
Unexpectedly, she shifted her footwork like a shadow, evading his spear effortlessly. Her spear advanced even further, aiming straight for his face.
"What?!"
Fei Tongxiao let out a gasp, clearly startled. He was unable to comprehend how she had so deftly eluded his spear moves. He hurriedly retracted his spear and stepped back, narrowly avoiding her strike.
Li Qinghong took advantage of this, unleashing an endless barrage of spear techniques aimed toward Fei Tongxiao. He retreated repeatedly, parrying dozens of strikes before he became frustrated and lifted his spear. A hazy layer of gray qi enveloped it, sending Li Qinghong's spear flying backward with one blow.
Li Qinghong observed his energy flow carefully before finally retracting her spear. She stood calmly, smiling.
"I expected no less of a Grade three spear technique… The Dragon Reflection technique is truly impressive."
Fei Tongxiao muttered incoherently to himself as he lowered his spear, puzzlement written across his face. He glanced at her and asked, "How did you dodge my spear technique, Sister Qinghong?"
Li Qinghong laughed softly, raising her head slightly.
"My family has a footwork technique known as River Crossing Torrential Step. It's incredibly profound. I have only mastered a couple of moves, but it has already proven highly effective."
"So it's a footwork technique!"
Fei Tongxiao had suspected as much and now had his answer as confirmation. He nodded enviously as he replied, "My grandfather told me that Senior Tongya had a mysterious footwork technique… it must be this one then!"
After exchanging a few more words, Li Qinghong escorted Fei Tongxiao out of the courtyard. She then lifted her spear and stood still, reflecting on the moment Fei Tongxiao had used the Dragon Reflection technique. She murmured quietly to herself.
"That spear aura… how exactly did he achieve that...?"
She pondered for a while, then went inside to retrieve ink and brush, meticulously noting down her insights from the day and carefully putting the book away.
She thought to herself, There's no way I can learn the Dragon Reflection technique here… I have mastered most of the spear techniques, and what's left is just polishing my skills. My cultivation has reached the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. With two more years of refinement, I should be able to condense the final chakra and start accumulating for the Qi Cultivation Realm.
Li Qinghong wiped her spear clean and placed it on the rack, muttering to herself, "I wonder how Granduncle is doing… and whether Father has broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm. I'll write a letter tomorrow to ask how things are back home."
Carefully closing the courtyard gate, Li Qinghong swept the snow away before settling down to meditate. She closed her eyes and sat cross-legged, beginning her cultivation.
Meanwhile, Fei Tongxiao left the courtyard, his body flushed with sweat. It only emphasized the chill of the biting snow and wind. He shivered but quickly dispelled the cold by circulating his mana, which drove away the chill almost instantly, thanks to his third chakra of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.
Fei Tongxiao walked briskly for a while until he saw a figure standing with hands behind his back in front of his own courtyard. The man's white robe billowed elegantly, and his handsome face was serene as he stood with his eyes closed.
Seeing this person, Fei Tongxiao could almost feel himself shrink as he cautiously approached, mumbling softly, "Father..."
Fei Yihe slowly opened his eyes. As Fei Wangbai's eldest son, he had reached the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
"You went looking for that girl again," he remarked.
"Yes..." Fei Tongxiao answered nervously, adding, "I only went to spar with her."
Fei Yihe shook his head. Now in his fifties, he had gone through this same phase and fully understood his son's intentions.
He sighed, speaking sincerely, "Xiao'er, I have met Li Qinghong… This girl is solely focused on cultivation and spearmanship. She does not seem interested in romance. You should temper your emotions."
Fei Tongxiao nodded silently, but Fei Yihe could tell his son had not taken his advice to heart. Seeing him hang his head in silence, he thought to himself.
Li Qinghong is graceful and radiant… I only hope that this boy is just infatuated by her beauty and will grow tired of it after a few years, rather than developing genuine feelings.
Fei Tongxiao remained quietly bowed, which pained Fei Yihe. He then asked, "What is Li Qinghong's current cultivation level?"
"The fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. She has condensed the Jade Capital Chakra," Fei Tongxiao answered truthfully.
Fei Yihe raised an eyebrow, shocked by such a revelation. He then said gravely, "She broke through again?! She's only sixteen… she truly is a prodigy!"
Fei Yihe's thoughts stirred as he looked at his youngest son and muttered, "Perhaps I could go to the Li Family to ask on your behalf, but this girl is so talented… we cannot have you join their family. Bringing it up would only damage relations between the two families, and your grandfather will not agree."
Finally, Fei Tongxiao raised his head, his expression unchanged as he said, "Father, you need not say more."
