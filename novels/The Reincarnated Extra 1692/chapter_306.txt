Now, to the Panemo Offshore!
* * *
Now, the next morning!
The weather is clear again today!
It looks like it’s going to be hot today too!
Under such a refreshing summer blue sky, where am I now, you ask……
<<<Anego! How’s the ride!?>>>
“No problem.”
I’m on top of Zaratopu’s head!
Standing on the head of this friendly Great Sea Serpent, with my arms crossed…… I am advancing through the vast ocean!
Even this sea, which seemed to have little wind and small waves when viewed from the cape, is a different story when going offshore.
With a loud sound of zaan, zaan, huge waves crash into Zaratopu, and the spray wets my body.
Zaratopu’s body continues to sway violently up and down.
I just said “No problem,” but Zaratopu’s ride quality itself is the worst.
However, don’t underestimate my fantasy inner ear.
I don’t feel sick at all, and my condition is perfect.
That’s why there’s “No problem.”
<I’m glad to hear that. Please keep it up in preparation for the upcoming battle.>
Now, where are we heading, you ask…… it’s the sea area that Zaratopu said was originally its dwelling.
We are going to defeat the monsters that are said to be occupying that area…… the Panemo offshore.

To summarize Zaratopu’s story from yesterday, it goes like this.
After escaping from its group, Zaratopu lived peacefully in the Panemo offshore for a long time.
Due to the ocean currents, humans didn’t approach, and that place, which was slightly shallow and full of fish to catch, was Zaratopu’s favorite territory and a heavenly place for it.
However, recently, that situation drastically changed.
<<<Two demons appeared……>>>
……I don’t know what a Great Sea Serpent’s complexion looks like, but probably based on the tone of its 【Telepathy】, Zaratopu said that while turning pale.
Two demons.
Giant magical beasts that rival even Zaratopu’s huge body.
Those creatures suddenly appeared in Zaratopu’s territory and started attacking it.
Originally, those two, who shouldn’t possess much intelligence, moved as if they were coordinating with each other despite being different species, and cornered Zaratopu.
Zaratopu, who was already timid and lacked confidence in fighting, became completely frightened and abandoned its favorite territory and fled without much struggle.
And the place it ended up was that cape, causing trouble for the residents of Panemo Village.
<<<Ah, but I didn’t stay holed up at the cape the whole time! I basically went out a bit in the opposite direction of my original territory to eat! There were a lot of big human ships floating there at first, but recently there are fewer, and it’s a relatively easy place to live!>>>
No, I’m not interested in the information about whether it’s easy or not to live there from a Great Sea Serpent’s perspective.
Anyway, what’s important are those two giant magical beasts.
We’re going to defeat them.
That way, Zaratopu can return to its original territory.
The people of Panemo Village won’t have to be afraid of Zaratopu.
Case closed, hurrah.
<<<But I really don’t understand why those two attacked me…… they might have their own circumstances too……>>>
I’m impressed by Zaratopu’s kindness for saying such things, but I made it stop speculating further.
I decided to help Zaratopu.
I decided to kill those two magical beasts.
The only thing behind this battle is my selfish thinking.
That’s good enough.
If anything happens, I’ll take the blame for being tyrannical or thoughtless.
Anyway, defeat them.
Kill them.
Kill them!
While being rocked by the waves on top of Zaratopu, I consciously dye my mind bright red.
* * *
<<<We’ve arrived, Anego!>>>
Zaratopu’s 【Telepathy】 reaches my mind, which had become a bit dazed from raising my killing intent too much.
I hurriedly regain my composure and look around, but……
“……Here?”
<<<Yes, here!>>>
I can’t really tell the difference from the surrounding sea areas.
It looks exactly the same as the sea around it.
<<<But this is definitely it…… this is now their territory…… they could attack at any moment.>>>
Being told that, I brace myself again.
Since Zaratopu’s movement has ended and I don’t have to worry about wind resistance, I deploy 【Black Arms】.
<<<Those guys are…… in a word…… really creepy fellows. You never know what they’ll do. Please be very careful.>>>
“Understood.”
I reply with few words and heighten my vigilance.
Then, at that moment.
Bubble, bubble, bubble……!
Right in front of us, about a few dozen meters ahead on the sea…… large bubbles started rising from underwater and popping!
<<<Ah! T-They’re here! It’s them!>>>
Zaratopu sends a 【Telepathy】 while making a high-pitched warning sound!
Bubble, bubble, bubble……!
Do…… paaaahn!!
Almost simultaneously, the amount of bubbles popping on the sea surface increased, and the sea surface suddenly swelled up!
“!!”
The being that leaped out of the sea with a large splash of water…… that was one of the “demons” Zaratopu spoke of!
A huge body that makes Zaratopu’s size pale in comparison…… reminiscent of a small island!
Gigantic claws that could easily tear apart even dragons……!
A blood-red, intimidating color scheme……!
An extremely thick carapace that exudes a heavy presence like steel……!
Furthermore, it has numerous large barnacles clinging to it, waving their tentacles eerily……!
In a word, it’s……!
A super, giant…… shrimp!!
<Aah! This is!?>
Extra-sama, noticing something upon seeing the giant shrimp, shouts!
What’s wrong!?
Do you know about this guy!?
<Yes…… I know, without a doubt! I have seen this shrimp before in the Fishing God’s isekai reincarnation broadcast!>
W-What did you say!?
<This is the legendary giant shrimp that is said to have destroyed a maritime nation!>
The legendary giant shrimp!?
<It has been feared as the king of shrimp for at least 500 years!>
The king of shrimp!?
<The number of fixed nets it has torn apart with its giant claws is countless! The total damage has already reached an astronomical figure!>
The fishermen’s nemesis!?
<Its name is…… “The Shrimp That Rules All Shrimp,” Ebitouzi!!>
“EBIIIIIIIIIIII!!”
Ebitouzi, while letting out a ferocious scream…… raised its giant claws high in the sky in an intimidating manner!
The shrimp of a different world…… screams!!
