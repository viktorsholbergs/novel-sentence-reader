Wan Xiaohua sat wearily at the table, his complexion betraying his exhaustion.
As a cultivator who had condensed the Jade Capital Chakra in his Shenyang Mansion[1], he should have been able to remain alert even after three days and nights without sleep.
However, the recent spate of troubles weighed heavily on him, and he felt himself struggling to cope.
“What are your thoughts on the letter from the Li Family, Yuankai?” Rubbing his temples, he looked wearily at his subordinates.
Before Wan Yuankai could respond, a muscular man beside him interjected confidently, “Isn’t it obvious? This Li Family is weak. They are delusional to think otherwise. With their two family members alone, you could easily force them to surrender their spirit fields to us!”
The burly man stared at Wan Xiaohua, who was seated in the central seat.
Wan Xiaohua inwardly cursed at his stupidity, then questioned him, “Someone among the Li Family is cultivating in the sect. What do we do if that immortal cultivator comes after us in retaliation?”
“That…” Caught off-guard, the burly man fell silent.
Wan Yuankai then stepped in and said, “If the Li Family requests thirty percent of the harvest, then we should agree to their terms. Our inventory has been dwindling year after year, we might struggle to pay the necessary tributes. Survival is our priority now.”
Wan Xiaohua nodded in agreement and added thoughtfully, “The thirty percent is probably further negotiable. Given the Ji Family’s formidable power and the precarious situation we’re in, I’m sure the Li Family won’t push us too hard. After all, we need to depend on each other.”
His expression darkened at the mention of the Ji Family. Setting the letter down, he continued, “Years ago, Mount Yubu was our boundary. But now, we've been driven back to Guli Road. Ji Dengqi’s relentless oppression has forced us to retreat time and time again over the years, hardly giving us a moment of rest.”
Wan Yuankai, clenching his teeth, acknowledged the grim reality with a heavy sigh. “Indeed, but there’s a silver lining. The spiritual energy at Mount Dali’s Northern foot is slowly recovering. It might just be our ticket out of this, although we don’t have control over it yet.”
Wan Xiaohua chuckled and remarked coldly, “For now, I believe it’s for the best. Guarding that area requires manpower we can’t afford to spare. If you’re there, who’s going to guard our home? Besides, that might draw the Ji Family’s attention. They certainly won't stand by and let us expand without sticking their noses in.
“Ji Dengqi has been stirring up trouble, sending people to manipulate those idiots in the branch families to turn them against us. If we want to reach out to the Li Family or send someone there, we must be discreet about it so that Ji Dengqi doesn’t catch wind of our plans!”
Wan Yuankai responded with a firm nod. “I’ve already arranged for our clan brother to fake his death and head to Lidaokou Village. Ji Dengqi’s informants are mere mortals. I’m sure they won’t suspect a thing.”
“Tiancang is eloquent, cautious, and reliable. I trust him fully with this task,” Wan Xiaohua said.
As he softly placed his brush down on the map laid out before him, his gaze turned cold as he quietly said, “We’ve got to watch our step and keep an eye out for any potential traitors in our midst.”
Li Tongya, feeling the constant surge of mana whirling within him, chuckled softly. “Finally, after nearly four years, I’ve succeeded in condensing the Celestial Whirl Chakra.”
Liu Rouxuan tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. With her black eyes fixed on Li Tongya, she congratulated him with a warm smile, “Congratulations on your achievement, Brother Tongya!”
Li Tongya turned his head to the side, attempting to hide his discomfort from her direct gaze.
“It’s just a minor achievement in the Embryonic Breathing Realm. That’s hardly something worth celebrating!” he responded, slightly flustered.
Li Tongya watched as Liu Rouxuan giggled at his reaction and shook his head in resignation.
He looked at the sky and changed the subject, “I’ve been in seclusion for a day and a night. I should check on Xiangping first.”
Liu Rouxuan nodded vigorously, trying to stifle her giggle as she replied, “All right.”
Li Tongya left the small courtyard and headed toward the Li Residence’s front yard. As he approached, he overheard a conversation in the main courtyard that made him pause.
Ren Ping’er was sewing silently in the main courtyard, but Li Xuanxuan appeared to be on the verge of tears as he clung to her dress, kneeling on the floor.
“Mommy! Why does everyone else have a daddy, but I don’t? Even Li Xiewen has a daddy! Where’s mine?”
Ren Ping’er quickly bent down to hold Li Xuanxuan in her arms. “Your father has gone to a distant place…” she replied to her son with a heartbroken voice.
However, Li Xuanxuan pulled away and cried out in frustration, “That’s a lie! You’re lying! If he’s somewhere far away, why hasn’t he sent us any letters? Everyone told me that daddy’s dead!”
Ren Ping’er was at a loss as she looked at Li Xuanxuan, who was in tears.
The scene pained Li Tongya. He let out a long sigh before entering the main courtyard and gently lifting Li Xuanxuan into his arms.
Upon seeing Li Tongya, Li Xuanxuan wiped his tears and asked, “Second Uncle, do you know where my daddy is?”
Li Tongya patted Li Xuanxuan’s back, and with a touch of melancholy in his voice, he replied, “Your daddy was a kind man, a generous brother…”
Li Xuanxuan’s sobs intensified at these words. At that moment, Li Yesheng entered the courtyard.
Seeing him, Ren Ping’er hastily took the sobbing Li Xuanxuan away, leaving Li Tongya and Li Yesheng alone in the courtyard.
Li Tongya composed himself, then asked, “What's the matter?”
“There’s a man outside, dressed like a hunter, asking to see you. He claims to be from the Wan Family and says he has an appointment,” Li Yesheng informed him.
Li Tongya was slightly taken aback. He rubbed his chin curiously then gestured for the visitor to be brought in. “Let him in then,” he said.
The man Li Yesheng brought in was clad in leather armor and carried a longbow on his back. Despite his plain appearance, he had a pair of keen eyes.
He cupped his fist respectfully to Li Tongya and greeted, “Greetings, Young Chief! I’m Wan Tiancang from the Wan Family!”
Li Tongya, raising an eyebrow, internally noted that this man seemed more capable than Wan Yuankai and was probably not that easy to handle.
With a smile, he humbly replied, “I hardly deserve the title ‘young chief’, I’m just managing some village affairs.”
He then gestured welcomingly and said, “This way, please.”
Wan Tiancang immediately raised his eyebrows, thinking to himself, “I’ve heard that Old Master Li rarely makes appearances. It’s said that the Li Family is co-managed by these two brothers without a clear leader. Li Tongya seems to be careful with his words. I wonder what kind of person Li Xiangping is.”
Though these thoughts raced through his mind, he maintained a cordial demeanor, smiling and saying, “Thank you.”
Upon entering the main courtyard, Wan Tiancang saw an elder seated at the central seat, sipping on a cup of tea. The elder glanced at him, then slightly nodded his head to acknowledge his presence.
Wan Tiancang could not help but admire Li Mutian’s extraordinary aura and unusual calmness and inwardly marveled, He must be Old Master Li, the head of the Li Family. As expected of someone who had attained the Foundation Establishment Realm; his elegance sets him apart from ordinary people.
With great respect, he bowed deeply. Upon rising, he was visibly moved to tears and choked up as he greeted the elder, “Greetings, Senior.”
Li Mutian, setting down his teabowl, responded in a deep voice, “What brings you to such emotion?”
Wiping away his tears, Wan Tiancang explained, “Your presence reminds me of my late father, who suffered a lot because of Ji Dengqi’s cruelty. He even lost nine hundred jin of our family’s Spirit Paddies. Due to this, we’re struggling to pay tributes for the coming years.”
“Nine hundred jin?”
Hearing this, both Li Tongya and Li Mutian exchanged meaningful glances. They seemed to have a moment of realization, and Li Tongya thought to himself, This man is aiming for a portion of our family’s thirty percent harvest.
