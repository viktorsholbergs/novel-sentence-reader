Li Yuanjiao waited for only a short while before Li Xijun arrived on the wind. He had been consolidating his cultivation during this period. Since he often had to go out, he was not in a hurry to break through and remained at the fifth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation, mostly practicing swordsmanship and spells.
"Second Uncle... my condolences."
Upon seeing Li Yuanjiao, Li Xijun bowed and offered a few words of comfort.
Li Yuanjiao nodded and asked in a serious tone, "You let Kongheng go, huh?"
Li Xijun took a deep breath and replied respectfully, "I have faith in my decision. Kongheng is practicing ancient Buddhist techniques… and isn't that strong. Although he is a Master Monk, his strength is only at the early stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm… Furthermore, he is an open-hearted person..."
Li Yuanjiao could no longer listen and his face contorted with slight anger. Without drawing the Qingche Sword, he struck Li Xijun on the back with it, causing him to stagger from the impact.
"How can you wager on something like this?!" he shouted.
Li Xijun bowed again and said, "Please have faith in me, Second Uncle. Kongheng is a good person. Xijun is certain about this! He has been caring for the people and curing diseases for many years at the foot of the mountain, waiting for this opportunity..."
Li Yuanjiao frowned and replied coldly, "What does Kongheng's opportunity have to do with me? Whether he lives or dies has nothing to do with my family! Why should my family take the risk?"
"I don't care how long he has waited for this opportunity… Buddhist cultivators are people who devour lives! You may have a good personal relationship with him and are willing to help him, but not me!"
Li Xijun raised his head meekly and replied, "If Kongheng can break through, even if he is a Master Monk, he will still be very powerful compared to Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators... Since he has received great favor from us... he will become a powerful ally to us!"
He quickly continued, "I understand the resentment Second Uncle feels toward them, but there are many Buddhist cultivators now in our region. You can easily find six of them among ten people. My family has made enemies with the Wrathful Dao lineage and can no longer go north. Must we offend another orthodox sect like the Liao River Temple…?"
"That's your aunt breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!" Li Yuanjiao reminded him angrily.
Li Xijun kneeled and assured softly, "Uncle! Aunt will definitely be fine and succeed in establishing her foundation! No matter who wants to use, consume, or manipulate fate..."
He raised his head and continued, "They'll only do it to those who have already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm! If Kongheng were possessed by a Maha, he couldn't possibly evade the eyes of the Yuan Family and Senior Wushao! If he were a Maha, he would wait for Aunt to break through before eating her life. He would have already discussed this with all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators; our family wouldn't be able to escape this tragedy!"
"Besides, if he intended to harm her, what difference would there be between Moongaze Lake and Heavenly Thunder Peak?" he challenged.
Li Yuanjiao narrowed his eyes at him and asked coldly, "How do you know for sure?"
In that moment, he seized Li Xijun, sealed his cultivation, and then forcefully flew him to the ancestral hall. He pushed open the wooden door with a creak, threw Li Xijun into the hall, and commanded in a deep voice, "Kneel here while I bring Kongheng back!"
Li Xijun lowered his head and nodded. Li Yuanjiao turned to leave, riding the wind down the mountain. Realizing his intention, Li Ximing chased after Li Yuanjiao hurriedly, wanting to dissuade him, only to be stopped by Xiao Guiluan.
"Madam! Nothing even happened on Heavenly Thunder Peak… There is no need for him to be that angry!"
Li Ximing tried to reason with her, but Xiao Guiluan shook her head helplessly and urged softly, "Just go back... Those two are just putting on a show for Kongheng. You shouldn't get involved."
"Ah!"
Li Ximing was taken aback for a moment and realization dawned upon him. Though less disciplined, he was no fool; he understood the situation and decided to return.
After persuading Li Ximing to return, Xiao Guiluan landed on her peak and picked up Li Yuexiang with a sigh, who had come to greet her.
My husband still resents Buddhist cultivators…
The central hall of Lijing Town.
An old man kneeled at the bottom of the steps. His hair and beard were entirely white, and he was at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He looked very solemn as he bowed respectfully and spoke in a deep voice.
"Thank you for all the kindness you have shown my daughter and me over the years, Family Head. The Meng Family is grateful. Now that I am old, I fear I can no longer refine dharma artifacts for your esteemed family. Hence, I would like to offer my legacy!"
"Offer your legacy?"
Li Yuanping frowned as he looked at the old man before him.
"Elder Meng, you must be joking. My family does not covet your legacy," he explained.
Meng Taizhi lowered his head and replied, "I believe I have only a few years left. I plan to enter seclusion and attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. This is a desperate move—a gamble before death. I only hope to find a way forward for my daughter... I am willing to exchange my legacy for your protection."
Li Yuanping was still perplexed by the man's actions and shook his head slightly.
However, Meng Taizhi continued, "My legacy comes from the Eastern Sea's Jiaozhu Gate, and it's definitely not an ordinary thing. Please listen to me first, Family Head..."
The old man kneeled on the ground and explained respectfully, "The legacy I received is from Jiaozhu Gate, which has been destroyed for a thousand years. All grudges are long gone, leaving no cause for concern. You can use it with confidence."
"Furthermore, this method involves nine refinements and six castings, which makes it an extraordinary casting technique. As long as you have the talent in this dao and practice diligently, you will surely achieve significant achievements and be able to craft Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts, or maybe even Foundation Establishment Realm artifacts," he added.
"Oh?"
Li Yuanping looked at him quietly and asked, "What do you want in exchange, old man? Are you hoping to marry your daughter off?"
Meng Taizhi bowed again and humbly replied, "I wouldn't dare... My daughter was married to a hero in the Eastern Sea. Unfortunately, he was later killed and she was injured by mana light. Our lineage is pretty much severed..."
Li Yuanping nodded, his expression softening slightly. Meng Taizhi then continued, "I only ask for two things. First, I hope my daughter can learn alchemy from your family, so she can make a living and defend herself."
"Second, I hope your esteemed family can offer this sole daughter of mine some protection after my death. Once she becomes stronger, she will stop troubling your family and seek her own way in life."
Li Yuanping looked at him and asked, "Since you come from the Eastern Sea, did you encounter some kind of trouble...?"
Meng Taizhi shook his head and replied frankly, "My family members are merely rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea. We were later destroyed by devil cultivators. My ancestors had some connections with the Xiao Family and went to them to seek refuge... but only my daughter and I were left along the way. Even my son-in-law died during the journey..."
"I see," Li Yuanping replied indifferently as he continued, "But I investigated and found no trace of blacksmiths surnamed Meng in the Eastern Sea or any leaving that area recently."
Meng Taizhi smiled bitterly, shaking his head.
"My family was originally guest cultivators of a minor sect on Yuanting Island. After we were destroyed by the devil cultivators, we found ourselves wandering outside. You can verify this, Family Head; the Xiao Family knows the truth," he explained patiently and humbly.
Li Yuanping nodded and asked again, "Why not pass this legacy to the Xiao Family? Wouldn't it be better to have a Purple Mansion immortal clan protect it? My family is just a normal clan, we can't compare to them."
