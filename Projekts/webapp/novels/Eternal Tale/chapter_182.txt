"Let's buy some of these things. They’re good and will save us spirit stones." Chen Xun felt a slight thrill in his heart. "In the future, we'll lay them out on our giant flying boat, and that will be our home."
"Moo?!"
"Old Ox, I already have a blueprint in my mind. There will be places for planting spiritual herbs, an alchemy room, everything."
"Moo?!!"
"There will also be a closed-door cultivation room, a control room, and we’ll plant a huge Crane Spirit Tree on it—our old companion."
"Moo?!!!"
With each sentence Chen Xun spoke, the big black ox jumped in surprise, its black face flushing with excitement.
"Hehe, we’ll also place your strongest formations all around. Even if we wander, we’ll always have our own home!"
"Moo~~~~!"
The big black ox panted heavily, its eyes wide with amazement at Chen Xun’s incredible imagination...
They had been on small flying boats and seen treasure ships, but there was nothing like the flying boat Chen Xun described in this cultivation world.
"Old Ox, I have already laid out our next steps." Chen Xun's mouth gradually twisted into a grin, his eyes showing a domineering look. "Old Ox, first step, condense Nascent Soul stage spiritual energy. Begin by practicing auxiliary techniques and start closed-door cultivation."
"Moo moo!" The big black ox kept rubbing against Chen Xun, growing more excited.
Chen Xun looked around. No one dared to spy on them anymore, and no formation could stop their steps. They had become truly formidable cultivators in this realm!
"Let's get to it!"
"Moo!"
They rushed into the closed-door cultivation room, calming their minds, and began to operate the 'Jade Spirit Chapter.' With the added boost from their spiritual energy, it seemed even more terrifying...
A low pressure gradually managed throughout the cave mansion, like the breathing of a giant beast. With each exhale, vast amounts of spiritual energy sprayed out, shaking the surroundings. With each inhale, a huge amount of spiritual energy was drawn into their bodies.
The spirit-gathering formation in the cave mansion constantly swayed. Pure spiritual energy sometimes gathered in large quantities, then retreated as if spooked, seemingly unable to withstand the pressure.
But all of this was concealed by the big black ox’s formations, preventing even those in Snow Listening Valley from sensing it. It was as if this place was isolated from the outside world, forming its own realm.
In the hall, Jin Yu sat cross-legged in the center, a baby-like phantom with closed eyes hovering above her head, looking slightly pained.
Formations crisscrossed the entire hall, shining with blue light. She was bathed in beams of spiritual energy, recovering from her Nascent Soul injuries.
She suddenly opened her eyes, a flash of shock quickly disappearing. Her expression changed as she muttered, _"What terrifying formation skills..."_
A place within Snow Listening Valley had lost all sensory connection, even severing ties with the valley's grand formation, as if it had been completely erased from existence. That place was precisely around Chen Xun and the big black ox’s cave mansion.
Jin Yu pondered for a long time, her gaze growing more complex. _"I don't know if bringing these two here is a blessing or a curse for my Moon Tower."_
She quietly withdrew her little schemes. It was best not to plot too deeply against such individuals; they were far from simple.
"Senior sisters, I am struggling alone; there is no other way." Jin Yu slowly closed her eyes, a sigh echoing in the hall. "I only hope for a triumphant return from the northern border..."
In another cave mansion, Jiang Xuechen suddenly felt a sense of dread. Her cave mansion was not far from those two.
An ancient jade slip lay before her, with a few cracks on it, but she hesitated to perform an augury, her hands trembling slightly.
"Minor divinations bring pleasure and predict fortunes and misfortunes. Moderate divinations harm the body and sever the path to immortality. Major divinations defy the harmony of heaven and bring misfortune upon oneself. The Jiang family now only has her left..."
Jiang Xuechen took a deep breath, recalling the divination from that night. She had spat out a mouthful of reverse blood, causing the jade slip to crack in several places.
This item was an ancient inheritance from the Jiang family. They were not originally from this realm of cultivation but had come from the west, beyond the Tian Duan Plains.
That night, she hadn’t actually divined anything, but given the circumstances, she could only subjectively conclude it was a great omen of misfortune.
Jiang Xuechen gently put the jade slip back into her storage ring, calming her mind and continuing her cultivation. Her cultivation progress had been stagnant, even with precious elixirs.
It seemed unrelated to her aptitude or spiritual roots, as if her bloodline was suppressing and hindering her.
Time passed silently. The Snow Listening Valley remained blanketed in heavy snow, becoming quite still. Whether in the Qian Nation or the eastern regions, the remaining cultivators felt a sense of unease.
There were no more reports from the north. Cultivators sent to investigate were blocked by great formations, and the glaciers were stained with blood. The war seemed to have reached its depths, with no one knowing the current state of affairs or the nature of the upheaval.
Elders from various sects began to restrain their disciples, and the Top Ten Sects of the Qian Nation fell into complete silence, with no disciples visible outside.
Southern Dipper Mountain had not opened for many years, and Yuxu City had closed its gates, driving out many cultivators who dared not voice their anger.
In many places across the Qian Nation, the Ascension Conferences were no longer held. Countless aspiring immortals and rogue cultivators lamented the severed path to immortality.
This led to more fierce struggles in the lower echelons of the cultivation world, with Foundation Establishment cultivators declaring themselves kings.
Unknowingly, many future cultivation talents were crushed, fading into obscurity. The unknown outcomes of the war were already subtly affecting the entire cultivation world.
...
Time flowed steadily amid the chaos of the cultivation world, and fifty years had passed since Chen Xun and the big black ox began their seclusion.
In Snow Listening Valley, their cave mansion finally stirred with activity.
**Buzz**
**Buzz**
Vast, majestic spiritual energy swept through the surroundings, shattering the spirit-gathering formations. The spiritual energy around the cave mansion was entirely absorbed, no longer merely dispersed.
Ten Nascent Soul phantoms sat above the cave mansion, surrounded by a five-colored divine aura, inhaling and exhaling the elemental energies of heaven and earth.
Upon closer inspection, it was five humans and five oxen! Their eyes were cold and indifferent, exuding a terrifying elemental pressure.
Lightning flickered around Chen Xun and the big black ox, their spiritual energy condensed to the extreme, now even nurturing their physical bodies with the tempering power of tribulation.
They walked out of the cave mansion, each step causing a muffled rumble from deep within the earth.
"Old Ox, we've been in seclusion for fifty years, yet it feels like just yesterday." Chen Xun grinned, looking at the big black ox. "But it seems pretty good; our survival strength has increased again."
"Moo~~" The big black ox responded with a call, looking at Chen Xun and gradually grinning.
Their immortal points, if not reaching the maximum threshold, could be accumulated, and used to calculate the duration of their seclusion.
Chen Xun did not hesitate, directly enhancing their defenses.
Their current points:
Strength 140, Speed 140, Essence of All Things 140, Spiritual Energy 140, Defense 191 (140).
