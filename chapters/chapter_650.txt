Li Zhouwei responded politely, and Madam Hu could only nod, watching him return to his desk. She ground ink for him as the boy silently practiced calligraphy.
She watched the child writing with steady, precise strokes, each character upright and orderly. For a moment, she found herself at a loss for words.
Madam Hu stayed until deep into the night, yet Li Zhouwei hadn't moved from his spot even once. There was no trace of the usual mischief or restlessness of a typical child; his expression remained unchanged as he silently practiced his calligraphy.
Madam Hu stared into his eyes, watching the colors shift gradually. As the sky darkened, the hues in his gaze grew more radiant. The old white-furred monkey came forward to light a lamp. The dim, yellow glow illuminated the room, casting shadows that held Madam Hu entranced.
She stayed until the sky was entirely dark. The old monkey approached, his voice hoarse as he spoke, "Madam, please return. The young master needs to rest."
The white-furred monkey, long since having ruined his vocal cords, now relied on mana to resonate his voice, making it sound devoid of emotion. Madam Hu snapped out of her trance, quickly standing up. Li Zhouwei quietly rose as well, escorting her to the courtyard gate with steady steps. In a soft voice, he said, "Farewell, Mother."
Several maidservants who had been waiting by the gate hurried to meet her as she exited. Madam Hu walked some distance, her expression dazed and distracted. Unable to resist, she turned her head for one last look.
What she saw sent a chill through her. Amidst the pitch-black night, two golden points of light hovered in the darkness like glowing embers. They resembled the eyes of a predator—a tiger or a leopard—watching her silently from the shadows, unmoving.
Madam Hu stumbled slightly, hastily turning back around. The attendants nearby glanced at her in confusion. She took a few deep breaths, steadying her nerves, though her thoughts remained clouded. In a whisper, she murmured, "Could this really be my child? Born divine… or…"
She swallowed the rest of her words, her heart gripped by unease. …Or born monstrous.
As Madam Hu departed, Li Zhouwei stood motionless at the gate, watching her retreat until she and her entourage disappeared from view. Only then did he turn around and, in a tender yet unsettlingly calm voice, remark, "Mother is afraid of me."
The old white monkey crouched by his side, shuffling forward a step as he followed him. In a raspy voice, he replied, "Everyone in the household fears the Heir. Those who do not fear now will fear eventually. And those who already fear will come to fear even more."
Li Zhouwei remained silent. The old monkey kneeled to remove his shoes and escorted him into the sleeping quarters. His gravelly voice carried a faint reverence as he said, "In my hundred years of wandering through Wu and Yue, I have seen countless people. Never have I met anyone like the Heir. If I were to compare, perhaps only the former young master of the Slaughter Jun Gate might come close."
Li Zhouwei tilted his head curiously and asked, "Did he inspire fear in others?"
The old monkey smoothed his white fur with his claws and shook his head, "No, not at all. The Heir is both similar and dissimilar to him—like a ruler and a hero. They cannot be compared."
Li Zhouwei nodded slightly, as if he understood. Gradually, he closed his eyes, and the two faint golden lights in the darkness finally disappeared.
For over a year, Li Chengliao had been so busy that he barely had time to rest. The weather in Northern Yue Prefecture had grown increasingly unpredictable, shifting between rain and sunshine in scattered patches, creating an air of disarray.
The only constant was the barren land, incapable of yielding crops. Apart from a few clans, most others had begun considering relocation, with many already migrating southward.
The trend was clear to all. Even those with a keen eye for worldly affairs could see that the Profound Balance Atmosphere was deteriorating beyond repair. Many watched coldly as the Yue Cultivating Sect and the Azure Pond Sect clashed in northern Yue, waiting to see which way the winds of fate would blow.
Seated in the central hall, Li Chengliao received a flurry of messages daily, each one as fleeting as falling snow. After sifting through them for some time, one caught his interest.
"The Xiao Family has sealed their mountain for three years, recalling all their direct descendants within… completely cutting themselves off. It seems they are trying to avoid involvement in the conflict between the two sects." After careful thought, he found the move too drastic and couldn't help but muse inwardly, It is said Xiao Chuting climbed to the Purple Mansion Realm through sheer cunning. This action is unlikely to be as simple as it seems—there must be factors I am unaware of.
He set aside several letters sent back by Li Xizhi and read them carefully, feeling a sense of relief as he finished. "At least the Yue Cultivating Sect has not torn things apart yet. They show no signs of marching south to attack Azure Pond… though if they do, the Profound Balance Atmosphere will collapse even further."
Li Chengliao couldn't blame the Yue Cultivating Sect entirely. The Profound Balance Atmosphere was one of the most fragile forms of spiritual energy in existence. That it had persisted this long without interference was a testament to the Yue Cultivating Sect's dominance and reputation.
However, with the Azure Pond Sect now leading the charge, few sects were willing to allow Yue Cultivating Sect the advantage of nurturing another Golden Core Realm cultivator. It was already well enough that they had maintained it this long.
No matter what, these matters are far beyond my control. All I can do is provide relief for the common people. Li Chengliao thought as he folded up the letters, refocusing his mind.
Beside him, Chen Mufeng gently reminded, "My lord, you were scheduled to visit the Heir today."
Chen Mufeng had once been demoted to an ordinary member of the Jade Court Guards after a mistake, largely due to Xu Xiao's influence. Over the years, however, Li Chengliao had quietly allowed him to regain favor, and now Chen Mufeng had risen to the second-in-command position, second only to Chen Donghe.
"I have been so busy I nearly forgot!" Li Chengliao chuckled upon hearing the reminder. He stood, only to have someone announce from below that the heir had arrived.
It turned out that after waiting for some time without seeing Li Chengliao, and with the sky growing dark, Li Zhouwei had taken it upon himself to come over. Draped in a white-and-gold robe, he ascended the steps with calm confidence.
Now five years old, the boy had grown quickly. His long hair was tied neatly, and his small brows furrowed slightly, giving him a serious expression. He cupped his fist and greeted softly, "Father."
Li Chengliao laughed heartily and said, "I have been meaning to choose a weapon for you, but I have been so busy I nearly forgot. Come, come!"
He took Li Zhouwei's hand and dismissed the others, leading the boy briskly to the rear hall, where several jade boxes had been prepared. He motioned for Li Zhouwei to stand still, opening the first jade box while speaking softly, "The first is the sword, the most highly valued among weapons. It can be light or heavy, long or short, and is the most commonly used weapon in the world. Even those who do not practice swordsmanship often carry one—for ceremony, oaths, or even for ritual suicide."
Moving on, Li Chengliao explained, "Our family excels in swordsmanship. It is said that we possess a Grade Five sword manual, renowned across many sects. As for spirit swords, the family owns several. The Qingche Sword and the Hanlin Sword are both Foundation Establishment Realms."
As he finished, Li Chengliao drew the sword hanging from his waist. Its blade was smooth and gleaming, with scales-like patterns running along its surface, glinting faintly in blue under the light. He said, "This is the family's ceremonial sword, called Dragon Coiling Pillar. It measures three chi and seven cun long and symbolizes the leadership of the Li Family. One day, when you inherit the family, this sword will also belong to you."
Li Zhouwei blinked slightly, staring intently at the blade before replying softly, "Understood."
Li Chengliao put the sword away and opened two more jade boxes, revealing a longbow and a spear. His explanations for these were much briefer, summarizing their strengths and weaknesses before saying, "The family's spirit spear, Duruo, is in the hands of Ancestor Qinghong, while our only spirit bow is in the southern border. For now, there are no Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts available for either weapon."
The weight of his words made it clear how much importance Li Chengliao placed on his eldest son. Even though Li Zhouwei had yet to begin formal cultivation, he was already preparing Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifacts for him. Li Zhouwei, however, remained composed, merely asking, "Are there other options?"
At this, Li Chengliao patted his storage pouch and retrieved another weapon.
