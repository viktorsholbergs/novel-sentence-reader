Chapter 21: Staying Overnight
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Miss Shang of the Shang family closed her book and greeted Lu Yang and Peach Blossom Leaf with an icy tone, “Thank you for bringing Xiao Lu back. My name is Shang Yuan.”
The parrot, seeing Shang Yuan, fluttered its wings frantically, trying to escape Lu Yang’s grip. Lu Yang let go, allowing the parrot to fly around the room.
“Be more careful next time. Luckily, this parrot kept circling around Taiping Village. Otherwise, if it flew elsewhere, it would have been truly lost,” Lu Yang reminded Shang Yuan with a smile.
Shang Yuan, observing the two’s refined attire, could tell they were seasoned wanderers, embodying the chivalrous spirit. Their outfits were recommended by the Dao Seeking Sect’s mission hall, designed to give the impression of experienced, righteous wanderers.
However, Shang Yuan’s demeanor was somewhat distant. It was unclear if it was due to her personality or something else. “Xiao Lu is back, you can go now,” she said.
Peach Blossom Leaf frowned at Shang Yuan’s attitude.
Ignoring Shang Yuan’s hints to leave, Lu Yang cheerfully suggested, “Let’s chat. The Shang family seems quite welcoming, maybe they’ll even offer us a place to stay overnight.”
Shang Yuan scoffed, “The Shang family welcoming you doesn’t mean I do. Please leave, and it would be best if you leave Taiping Village as well.”
“Why leave Taiping Village? It’s free of demons and ghosts. Haven’t you been longing to hear about the outside world?” Lu Yang said.
Shang Yuan hesitated, not expecting Lu Yang’s response. Her tone softened slightly, “Where are you two from? I haven’t left home in nearly a month. Can you tell me about the outside world?”
“We come from one of the five great immortal sects, the Dao Seeking Sect, both of us are at the Foundation Building stage. We came to Taiping Village because of reports of a troublesome bird…”
Lu Yang narrated calmly and engagingly, captivating Shang Yuan with tales of a life on the road. She was drawn to the vast and mysterious world outside, wishing to experience it herself.
“I want to cultivate, but my father disagrees. He says it’s too dangerous. If he hadn’t been lucky in an ancient tomb, he would have died there.”
“I’ve asked him several times about his experiences, but he refuses to tell me,” Shang Yuan complained, frustrated by her father’s reluctance to share his thrilling adventures.
Lu Yang pondered, realizing that the head of the Shang family had his own story.
“What is the cultivation level of the head of the Shang family?” Lu Yang asked.
Shang Yuan rolled her eyes, thinking of her father’s smug face, “According to his own boasting, he used to be at the ninth level of Qi Refinement. After a major disaster, he barely survived, but his cultivation plummeted to the fourth or fifth level of Qi Refinement.”
Peach Blossom Leaf commented, “That’s still not bad. Taiping Village doesn’t have many cultivators. The strongest, the village head, is only at the seventh level of Qi Refinement. Being at the fourth or fifth level is quite comfortable for living, especially considering the Shang family head’s background.”
Shang Yuan sighed, “But I don’t want to be confined to just Qu River County. I want to travel the world and see its wonders and mysteries. You and I are of similar age, yet you’re already at the Foundation Building stage, and I haven’t even started Qi Refinement.”
Peach Blossom Leaf was about to offer some advice when they were interrupted by Steward Zhang knocking at the door, “Miss, it’s time for dinner. Also, the master specifically instructed that since it’s getting late, you two should stay the night after the meal.”
“Master and madam, along with Village Head Huang, are waiting for you.”
“Alright, let’s go,” Lu Yang replied.
Peach Blossom Leaf initially wanted to refuse but was stopped by Lu Yang, “See, I told you the Shang family is hospitable and would offer us a place to stay. Why not accept their kindness?”
…
At the dinner table, the head of the Shang family sat at the head, deeply engaged in conversation with Village Head Huang. Everyone else enjoyed the meal, which, although not comparable to the cuisine at the Dao Seeking Sect, was still delicious.
Steward Zhang and a maid respectfully stood by during the meal, serving diligently.
After an enjoyable dinner, Village Head Huang went home, while Lu Yang and Peach Blossom Leaf stayed overnight in the east wing, separated only by a wall. Peach Blossom Leaf was reluctant to sleep there, being particular about beds. Except for the bed in her Dao Seeking Sect’s cave, she found it hard to sleep elsewhere.
Peach Blossom Leaf knew this was a bad habit for a cultivator who often had to endure rough conditions. She tried to change but hadn’t succeeded yet. “Senior brother Lu can sleep anywhere,” she mused to herself, chuckling softly before yawning.
“Going to bed early today, looks like I’ll get a good night’s sleep…”
Suddenly, she realized something was wrong: “Wait! Someone poisoned us!”
She turned to grab her magical umbrella, Thousand Illusions, but found her spiritual energy sluggish and hard to control. Shocked, she realized someone had silently poisoned them – a poison targeted at cultivators. Knowing they were cultivators and still daring to act, the culprit must also be a cultivator.
There were only a few people in the Shang family, none except the family head seemed to be cultivators. Was it the Shang family head? Or a cultivator of higher rank that she couldn’t detect?
What about Senior brother Lu?
A series of questions flashed through Peach Blossom Leaf’s mind, leaving no time for detailed thought. Footsteps approached from outside.
The door opened to reveal Steward Zhang with an excited, cruel smile.
“It was you!” Peach Blossom Leaf exclaimed in shock, realizing it was Steward Zhang. She couldn’t have detected him as a cultivator, indicating his cultivation was higher than hers.
Steward Zhang held a skinning knife, its blade reflecting the moonlight, bright and sharp. He licked his lips, eyeing Peach Blossom Leaf struggling futilely, like a ferocious beast caught in a trap.
“Such beautiful skin, I’ve never seen anything like it,” he said, drooling at the sight. “I know you’re from the Dao Seeking Sect. Killing you would bring trouble as your sect is powerful, but your skin… it’s irresistible. I couldn’t help but take a risk when you decided to stay and dine with us.”
Realizing their dinner was poisoned, Peach Blossom Leaf listened as Steward Zhang admitted to being at the later stage of Foundation Building. Despite his boasting, he remained cautious – cultivators from the Dao Seeking Sect, even at the Foundation Building stage, were not to be underestimated.
“Relax, it’ll just hurt for a moment, and then you won’t be afraid anymore,” Steward Zhang said, licking the knife and approaching her.
Suddenly, Peach Blossom Leaf sprang up, her spiritual energy flowing freely. She grabbed her umbrella and smashed it onto Steward Zhang’s face, catching him off guard.
“How are you not poisoned?!” he exclaimed in shock.
