"Old Ox, are you here?"
"Moo!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox were secretly communicating with each other, constantly discussing their escape plan.
However, they still stood with their hands behind their backs on the snowy ground, silent and exuding an extraordinary aura, as if they were not afraid of the Nascent Soul ancestor.
In truth, their hearts were racing like mad. The name of Ancestor Jinyu had echoed in Nine Palaces Mountain for a century.
Early Nascent Soul stage, a mighty cultivator!
"So, it's Daoist Jinyu. I've heard much about you." Chen Xun chuckled softly, masking the tremor in his voice. "We mean no harm. Could we have a word?"
The big black ox was tense all over, secretly giving a thumbs-up. As expected of the boss.
"That depends on whether you are worthy." The old woman's voice exploded in the sky, the power of a Nascent Soul bursting forth. A small phantom appeared above her head.
A vast pressure swept out, accompanied by blazing golden light. The divine sense locked onto Chen Xun and the big black ox, seemingly about to suppress them directly!
"Retreat!"
"Quick, retreat!"
At that moment, Jiang Xuechen and the others outside Snow Listening Valley felt a suffocating pressure. The ancestor's wrath affected even the bystanders.
"These two are finished," they thought, retreating hundreds of feet away.
Yet, Chen Xun and the big black ox remained standing, seemingly immobilized by the pressure, left to face their fate.
Jiang Xuechen landed at a distance, unable to discern their cultivation level. They had never shown Nascent Soul power before.
If they were Golden Core cultivators, the suppression of a Nascent Soul over a Golden Core was like a father overpowering a son, inherently dominant.
**Boom, boom, boom!**
Ancestor Jinyu's Nascent Soul power seemed to want to split the ground. The earth shook, rippling with waves of spiritual energy.
A tumult like a sea of snow erupted, sweeping into the sky, engulfing Chen Xun, and the big black ox.
The women watching relaxed slightly. It seemed there wouldn't be a catastrophic battle within Nine Palaces Mountain; the two had been easily suppressed by the ancestor.
But suddenly!
In the next moment, Jiang Xuechen's body trembled violently, her eyes widened, and her breath almost stopped.
Not only she, but all the female cultivators outside the Snow Listening Valley were similarly shocked.
Because they saw an unbelievable scene.
**Boom!**
The erupting snow sea kept exploding, silver light and black rays shining out, illuminating the surroundings, even the drifting snow seemed to freeze.
The snow sea kept being ground into ice crystals, floating in the air, glittering with light, and the surrounding spiritual energy suddenly stalled.
A feeling of heart-palpitating fear swept over everyone. Witnessing this scene, they were all astonished. What was that feeling just now...
Yet Ancestor Jinyu, standing in the sky, revealed a slight smile.
In the center of the snowfield, the two still stood with their hands behind their backs, but Chen Xun was now glowing with silver light, with a few strands of silver in his black hair.
His pupils were filled with coldness and calmness, seemingly no longer black.
The big black ox's body surged with black fur, a hot breath spewing from its nostrils, its body becoming even more powerful and majestic, its pupils still somewhat strange.
They finally revealed their strongest defensive form, tempered by the heavenly tribulation.
"What are these two monsters..." Jiang Xuechen's nerves were stretched to the limit, and her heart was shaken to the core. The divination was right, "Great calamity!!"
The surroundings fell silent, dead still, with others not yet recovering from their shock.
_Absurd..._
Taking a blow from the ancestor head-on, yet unscathed, without even dodging. Absurd.
"Thank you, Daoist Jinyu, for showing mercy." Chen Xun slowly cupped his hands, looking up at the sky, "Can we talk now?"
The big black ox took a deep breath. The previous strike indeed lacked killing intent; it was just a test. However, its nerves were not as strong as its boss's, but it managed to hold on without mooing.
"Of course, Daoist, please," the old woman chuckled, unable to discern the two's appearance or cultivation level.
The brief spiritual pressure they emitted made her even more uncertain. Nascent Soul cultivators should avoid making enemies lightly.
Even the method they used to resist was casual and effortless, and her divine sense couldn't penetrate the artifacts they wore.
Such mysterious individuals: the old woman dared not provoke them at this moment, as great changes were already unfolding in the Northern Territory.
But she couldn't have imagined that they were merely late Golden Core cultivators pretending to be calm and acting like experts while the major forces were weakened.
"Daoist Jinyu, we intruded today and have already offended you. We dare not disturb you further." Chen Xun spoke righteously. They wouldn't dare enter Snow Listening Valley, "We only seek a 'Five Qi Ink Spirit Flower,' the younger the better."
"This is a minor matter."
With a wave of her hand, the old woman produced a spirit flower glowing with five colors, its stem jet-black, clearly a thousand-year-old specimen.
_What the..._
Chen Xun felt a surge of excitement but maintained a calm exterior: "We can exchange several other thousand-year-old spirit medicines, ensuring Moon Tower won't suffer a loss."
The big black ox's breath quickened slightly. With that spirit medicine, they could break into the Nascent Soul stage and experience a new world!
"Daoist, you're too polite. This flower isn't precious in the Snow Listening Valley. I'll give it to you." The old woman smiled kindly, waving her hand again. "Your willingness to come shows your sincerity."
Chen Xun was stunned as the Five Qi Ink Spirit Flower appeared in his hand. This Nascent Soul cultivator was nothing like he imagined; she seemed quite reasonable.
The big black ox couldn't help but place a hoof on Chen Xun's shoulder, barely able to hold it together.
"Daoist Jinyu, I'll be straightforward. This flower is of great use to us." Chen Xun bowed solemnly and took a storage pouch from the big black ox. "These spirit medicines are a 'gift' to Moon Tower. Thank you for your generosity!"
With a wave, the storage pouch flew to Jinyu, who, upon inspection, was slightly surprised by their generosity.
She seemed even more satisfied with them, nodding and smiling: "I am Jinyu."
"Chen Xun."
"If you need anything, feel free to come to Nine Palaces Mountain."
"Certainly!"
Chen Xun glanced deeply at Jinyu before turning to leave with the big black ox, feeling a mix of emotions.
The formations and barriers of Nine Palaces Mountain opened a path for them as if seeing them off. Along the way, female disciples bowed respectfully.
Outside Snow Listening Valley.
"Chen Xun... a good name." Jinyu descended gracefully, murmuring to herself, "Not from the other two major forces, nor one of the top ten sects."
"Ancestor," Jiang Xuechen stood respectfully in front of her.
"Well?"
"As I calculated, these two are of great misfortune."
"They still need to improve." Jinyu tapped her cane, smiling kindly, "They carry no malice, rare high-minded individuals in the cultivation world."
"Ancestor, you hold them in such high regard..." Jiang Xuechen raised her head slightly, surprised.
"Xuechen, how did the Moon Tower rise from obscurity in this chaotic world? It was never just through cultivation." Jinyu looked at Jiang Xuechen with kindness, "Forming friendships far and wide has always been our principle. Don't be so arrogant."
"I understand."
"Go on, then."
"Yes."
Jiang Xuechen left with a bow, still puzzled. Ancestor Jinyu seemed like a different person after returning.
Jinyu sighed softly. The upheaval in the Northern Territory might bring catastrophe to the entire cultivation world, and the root cause wasn't external.
It lay within the cultivation world itself, the culprit being the ten great immortal sects of the Qian Nation!
With a look of concern, she stepped into the sky and entered Snow Listening Valley, a plan gradually taking shape in her mind.
