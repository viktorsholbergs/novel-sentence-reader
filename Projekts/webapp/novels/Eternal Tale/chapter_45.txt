"478th place. We are in a good spot. We really did more in two days than in two years! 500 points!"
Chen Xun laid on the back of the ox, examining the yellow talisman in his hand.
He could exchange his contributions at the sect's main hall as soon as the Grand Competition ended.
"Moo~" The black ox turned its head and looked at Chen Xun’s injured body with worry.
"What’s with you, old ox? When did we have it easy? Even in Panning City, things didn’t always go our way. It was also a struggle to survive," Chen Xun said nonchalantly, smiling. "Getting some injuries in exchange for so many contributions is a win for us. We should be thankful towards the sect for providing an opportunity like this.”
"Moo moo~"
The big black ox nodded thinking that it would be great if it could take the hits for Chen Xun, it had tough skin and a strong body after all.
By the time they had returned to the Medicine Valley, Chen Xun felt much better. He applied an ointment on his body while the big black ox stood by his side.
"This is the Fasting Pill. We should keep it for emergencies. We don't really need it for now," Chen Xun said, taking out an earthen yellow pill.
He took such a pill a year ago, and indeed he didn't feel hungry after taking it, but it couldn’t be said that he was full—it was also rather tasteless.
"Moo moo!"
The big black ox sighed. It had also realized at one point that the Fasting Pill was not as delicious as the wild flavors of the mountain life. It felt more like being stuffed with a bunch of hay just to feel full.
"Old ox, why don’t you go and tend to the valley? Don’t worry, I am fine. I've applied the ointment everywhere," Chen Xun said, smiling. "They couldn't really hurt me. I didn't even try to dodge."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox nodded and went to check on the Medicine Valley. It hadn't been tended to for two days.
After the big black ox disappeared from sight, Chen Xun winced in pain.
Although he hadn't suffered internal injuries, the external wounds were truly painful.
Several days later, the sect's Grand Competition came to an end, and Chen Xun and the black ox rushed towards the sect's main hall.
They gave them their points but left them the competition’s tokens as a memento.
"Junior Brother Chen!" A familiar voice called out from behind. A figure came up to Chen Xun with a smile full of delight. "I didn't expect to see you here."
"Senior Brother Ji!" Chen Xun was similarly pleased to see him. He looked at Ji Kun, whose face had become a little more full, however he still had that skinny monkey look.
Chen Xun couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic. Even though they were in the same sect, it had taken them two full years to meet by chance.
"Junior Brother Chen, did you not become an outer disciple?"
"I'm in charge of managing the Medicine Valley. My family used to do this."
They walked to a secluded spot beneath a tree and began reminiscing. The big black ox followed them, lying down by their side.
"Junior Brother Chen, the Medicine Valley isn't a good place. They call it the land of dashed dreams. It's a place where the old sect members who feel they can't achieve Foundation Establishment go." Ji Kun seemed frustrated and advised, "Junior Brother, we still have plenty of time. Don't slack off!"
"Senior Brother Ji, I appreciate your concern, but I really don't like fighting and killing."
Chen Xun looked a little troubled. He understood Ji Kun's point that becoming an outer disciple offered more opportunities and would increase his cultivation faster.
"Junior Brother Chen, you probably don't know this…But have you heard what the disciples have been calling us, vagabond cultivators?” Ji Kun clenched his hand till they turned white.
"No, I have not." Chen Xun shook his head.
He felt that his fellow disciples were quite friendly and he hadn't experienced any discrimination.
"They call us... stepping stones. Even the Foundation Establishment elders don't care about us."
Ji Kun had spent the past two years as an outer disciple, dealing with various factions and power struggles, sometimes being taken advantage of for his contributions.
"Senior Brother Ji, what does that mean?" Chen Xun asked calmly.
In the past, he might have swung an ax or two at such statements.
"The Southern Dipper Mountain secret realm will open in three years, but most of the people going there will be vagabonds"
"Yes, I know that; otherwise, we wouldn't have a chance to join the sect."
"Do you know how many people go every twenty years…and how many can come back?" Ji Kun took a deep breath and said in a low voice, "Seven hundred people go. And less than a hundred return. Furthermore, if any of those hundred failed to harvest any Foundation Establishment Spirit Herbs, they won't gain anything."
"This is so grim!" Chen Xun exclaimed.
Although he had long known that they were going in as cannon fodder, he didn't realize it was this severe.
"Of course, we were selected as vagabond cultivators left by the Ten Great Sects. We might all seem equal on the surface, but which elder really cares about us?" Ji Kun's eyes were dim. These past two years had shattered many of his illusions. He had become gloomier.
The vagabonds who had the potential for Foundation Establishment had already been recruited by the Ten Great Sects. If they wanted to cultivate the Foundation Establishment, they had to walk the bloody path.
" Senior Brother Ji…are you suggesting that you want to go to the Southern Dipper Mountain secret realm?" Chen Xun said, checking his cultivation base. He was still at the eighth level of Qi Refinement. His strength might not be sufficient.
"Exactly!" Ji Kun nodded firmly. "I've accumulated enough contributions now. I plan to go into seclusion and cultivate. If I break through to the ninth level of Qi Refinement, my chances of surviving will be higher."
"Senior Brother Ji, can't you wait for the next twenty years? You're still so young; it would be better to improve your strength first."
"Junior Brother Chen, in twenty-three years, my vitality will decline, and my strength will greatly diminish. What will I use to compete?" Ji Kun clenched his fist tighter, his eyes filled with unwillingness. He truly couldn't accept it.
This statement struck a chord with Chen Xun. Indeed, the Qi Refinement period was fleeting, lasting only about a hundred years. How many twenty-year periods could cultivators have?
"Junior Brother Chen, today is such a sunny day, a good day for farewell."
Ji Kun smiled calmly. He really liked Chen Xun and felt that he had no ill intentions. Their interactions were always very relaxing.
After running around as an outer disciple for two years in the duty hall, he had realized the value of friends like Chen Xun. Perhaps Chen Xun's choice to manage the Medicine Valley was the right one.
"Senior Brother Ji, please wait a moment."
Chen Xun quickly took out a storage pouch and retrieved two Heavy Feather Pills and a bottle of Fasting Pills from it.
"Senior Brother Ji, I bought these Heavy Feather Pills in the Nine-Star Valley. There are still two left, and their medicinal properties are still intact."
Now, Chen Xun understood the concept of repaying kindness and grudges. He didn't dare to give too much and potentially damage their friendship.
"These are really Heavy Feather Pills," Ji Kun exclaimed. These were valuable pills for the Qi Refinement period and cost a high price. "Junior Brother Chen, I really shouldn’t. Please take them back. You also need them."
"Senior Brother Ji, please take them. You need them more than I do. We manage the Medicine Valley quite well now, and we earn a lot of contributions every year."
Chen Xun sincerely smiled and handed the pills to Ji Kun.
"Well, in that case, I'll accept one Heavy Feather Pill, but you must take the rest back." Ji Kun received them solemnly, his words leaving no room for debate.
"Alright, then," Chen Xun sighed softly and put the other items back into the storage pouch.
"Junior Brother Chen, Junior Brother Ox, I'll take my leave now. Please take care of yourselves." Ji Kun clasped his hands and glanced at the black ox, which promptly stood on all fours and let out a few low moos.
Ji Kun departed, and Chen Xun and the big black ox watched his retreating figure, which seemed lonely but resolute.
"Senior Brother Ji will definitely achieve Foundation Establishment. Don't you think so, old ox?" Chen Xun muttered.
"Moo~"
The big black ox nodded. The only person it had acknowledged as a senior brother was Ji Kun. Its accumulated merits will surely protect him.
"Let’s go back. I haven't finished weaving my straw hat yet."
"Moo~"
The man and ox made their way back to the Medicine Valley. A gentle breeze blew, causing many little fallen leaves to dance beneath the tree, creating a picturesque scene.
