Meanwhile on Wutu Peak…
Li Yuanjiao exhaled deeply. The scale pattern of the longsword named Dragon Coiling Pillar in his grip shimmered with an azure sheen as it caught the light. With his other hand, he held a light purple-colored manual titled the Law of Celestial Moon.
Now thirty-three, Li Yuanjiao stood at the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, just a step away from achieving the seventh heavenly layer. His progress, fueled by the Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit Talisman and the considerable resources of the Li Family, was already regarded as extraordinary.
By comparison, Li Tongya was already fifty when he reached the seventh heavenly layer, and Li Xuanfeng was nearly forty. Li Yuanjiao's rapid ascent definitely positioned him as an exceptional cultivator among the other disciples of the Li Family.
"I should break through to the seventh heavenly layer by the end of the year! The late stages of Qi Cultivation Realm are about accumulation… With seven or eight years of effort, followed by a talisman pill, I should be ready to attempt a breakthrough to the most difficult ninth heavenly layer. Just two more years, and I might attempt to build the Immortal Foundation."
If everything went according to plan, Li Yuanjiao should be able to seclude himself to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in his early forties.
He stowed the manual away and retrieved a white jade slip, titled the Law of Sexagenary Cycle Sword Manual—a commentary written by Li Tongya. Compared to the complicated Law of Celestial Moon, it was much easier to understand.
After carefully reading the content twice, he thought to himself, Granduncle's swordsmanship is exceptional, having been mentored by the Sword Immortal himself, yet he only grasped the sword element at the age of eighty… That shows how difficult it is to master the art of killing. I wonder how many swordsmen and Sword Immortals there are in Jiangnan…
Currently, only I can match my granduncle in sword talent. Qinghong and Xicheng prefer spears, and the next best swordsman in our family, Zhi'er, has gone to the sect. Xijun shows promise, whereas Ximing treats his sword merely as a tool, lacking the true spirit of a swordsman.
Deep in thought and stroking his chin, Li Yuanjiao was interrupted by a middle-aged man with slightly tanned skin, high eyebrows, and huge eyes. He approached and cupped his fist.
"Peak Master, there's been an incident on Guli Road!"
He was none other than Shamoli, a Qi Cultivator of the fourth heavenly layer who had given up on ruling Mount Yue State and now cultivated alongside Li Yuanjiao.
Despite being an unrefined Qi Cultivator, he consumed spiritual qi that had been mixed with water and purified. Skilled in the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique, he stood on par with regular Qi Cultivators.
Taken aback by the news, Li Yuanjiao rose on the winds. As he ascended, he saw smoke billowing from Guli Road, drawing cultivators from various families who also rose to investigate. Several white lights stayed in the air, signaling hesitation.
"Something happened at Cloud Crowned Peak!"
Thanks to the Xiao Family's efforts in renovating Guli Road, complete with stationed cultivators at newly established relay posts, news from Cloud Crowned Peak reached them swiftly.
Li Yuanjiao's expression darkened.
Oh no… How could this happen?! Father and the others are still at the marketplace!
"Let's go!"
He quickly descended, summoning Li Qinghong and An Zheyan, along with other seasoned Qi Cultivators before flying eastward together.
Li Xuanxuan watched the monkey vanish, his mind swirling with doubts and a nagging sense of fear that the creature might not return, which stirred a vague regret within him.
Splat.
Before he could dwell on these thoughts, a subtle flipping sound set off alarms in his heart. Unfortunately, the baleful flames in the backyard from the fire vein suppressed his spiritual sense, confining it to a mere few inches around him and preventing any investigation of his surroundings.
After waiting in the fire-enshrouded backyard for some time, Li Xuanxuan finally glimpsed a tall, dark figure with a halo of red light around him emerging from the baleful flames.
While Li Xuanxuan was waiting, he already had the most powerful fire talisman in his clutch. His eyes were fixated on the figure, carefully contemplating his next move.
Dressed in black and exuding blood qi, he must be a devil cultivator. I need to strike first! Even if I can't defeat him, I can at least escape…
While this person was busy looking around, Li Xuanxuan quickly acted. The talisman in his hand glowed a fierce red as he hurled it toward the figure while he drew a large ax from his storage pouch with the other hand, swinging it with a swift twist.
The devil cultivator, whose spiritual sense was suppressed by the baleful flames, had not anticipated such a sudden ambush from the shadows. Caught off guard and struck by a talisman of mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm, his face and body were instantly engulfed in flames.
"OWWW—!"
The baleful flame in the backyard and the fire spell sparked a chain reaction, boosting the fire intensity by thirty percent and casting a brilliant, red glow over the ruins. In this fiery light, Li Xuanxuan's ax gleamed menacingly as it descended upon the cultivator's neck.
Snap…!
A gruesome noise was heard as the devil cultivator's neck split into two like sugar cane, blood spurting everywhere violently.
Li Xuanxuan felt a moment of relief—until the headless body of his enemy staggered forward, its pale hands striking Li Xuanxuan's chest with surprising force.
"What?!"
The impact sent him flying, and he crashed into a crooked beam causing a loud noise. Ash and smoke billowed as two large pillars collapsed onto him.
Gasping and spitting out two mouthfuls of blood, Li Xuanxuan dared not continue staying on the ground. He struggled to rise to his feet, and the world was spinning around him. Meanwhile, the devil cultivator had somehow managed reattached his head, his face pale and his eyes filled with vivid anger and fear.
He cursed loudly, "I knew something was off! To think an immortal cultivator nearly killed me outright!"
Despite his exclamations, his actions were swift. He drew two short blades, their edges slick with blood. He was lightning fast and closed the distance in a blink, blades poised to strike.
Thankfully, Li Xuanxuan had held onto his dharma weapon through the pain. Twisting the handle of his ax, he used it like a shield to block the incoming attack, though the impact still sent a shock of pain through his chest.
With his free hand, he retrieved yet another talisman, releasing streams of golden light that formed a protective barrier around him. This allowed him a moment to catch his breath.
The devil cultivator, having missed his blow, quickly retreated, gasping for breath. Clearly still reeling from the earlier talisman attack, he cursed vehemently, "You motherfucking bum… How dare you sneak up on me?!"
Li Xuanxuan rose to his feet silently and carefully assessed the situation. His enemy was probably a mid-stage Qi Cultivator, now slightly weakened by his sneak attack.
This man is a lot faster than me… I can't afford to rush my escape; I need to seize every opportunity to get out of this alive!
In any case, Li Xuanxuan was secretly grateful that his foe was not as formidable as the previous devil cultivator with the thunder pearl, and their cultivation paths seemed quite different too.
I should strike while he's weak!
With that thought in mind, he swung his ax directly at the cultivator's face. The devil cultivator glared at him furiously and quickly crossed his blades in response to block the ax. He then moved his lips and spat out a mist of blood qi.
This blood qi mist was most likely some vile technique from devil cultivation. Unfamiliar with such means, Li Xuanxuan could only grit his teeth and back down.
What should I do?!
Li Xuanxuan was not adept in combat and lacked powerful strategies. The dharma ax that he wielded was more ornamental than practical, chosen only because it was an unused weapon in his family.
The devil cultivator began slicing away chunks of flesh, leaving a bloody, gaping wound in his thigh. As Li Xuanxuan watched the devil cultivator regain his composure and use his superior speed to fight, anxiety gripped him.
With gritted teeth, he pulled out a dozen talismans from his sleeve, muttering quietly to himself.
"I'm reluctant to use these… but my life depends on them."
