Li Xuanling set down his chopsticks, his expression turning somewhat despondent.
After a long pause, he said, "What else can we do? Yuanyun finds solace in the company of Sister Jingtian as they share similar fates… If he wishes to stay on the mountain and read, let him. We can't possibly ask him to come down, that'd only hurt him more."
Lu Wanrong sighed softly.
"It would be best if she's willing to teach him. I initially thought about having him come down the mountain to manage some worldly affairs to distract him as that might ease his melancholy over time."
Having seen many such kinsfolk without spiritual orifice in her youth, Lu Wanrong was experienced in dealing with such situations. She had come to make this suggestion, but knowing that staying with Li Jingtian was preferable to coming down the mountain, she changed the subject.
"Qinghong loves to train with a spear, but we lack a proper master at home. Now that she has reached the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, not even the skilled mortals below can match her. My dear, could you possibly find a good teacher for her?"
"I'll keep it in mind and ask my father when I get the chance," Li Xuanling replied as he nodded in agreement.
As the couple shared an intimate moment together, the stone door beside them creaked. Some dust flew up as it moved aside to reveal a young man carrying a golden longbow who stepped out.
Seeing the couple, he raised an eyebrow and greeted them.
"Brother Ling, sister-in-law."
"Greetings, elder brother," they both replied as they stood up.
Li Xuanfeng nodded, his demeanor fairly relaxed as he said, "I've just broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm. With the day of the ritual approaching, I decided to step out for some fresh air."
Li Xuanling breathed a sigh of relief.
"We still haven't secured a demon beast for the sacrifice. With father deep in his breakthrough, I dare not disturb him. I'm glad you're out now; Yuanxiu was just about to knock on your door."
Placing his Golden Age Longbow on the ground, causing a gust of air to burst forth, Li Xuanfeng joined Li Xuanling at the table as the latter recounted the happenings of recent years.
After listening, Li Xuanfeng responded, "It's fortunate that all is well. Once Shamoli achieves the Qi Cultivation Realm, Second Uncle won't need to be troubled. With my bow alone, not a single Qi Cultivator from Mount Yue will escape."
Li Xuanling smiled and nodded, adding, "We still haven't gathered the unrefined qi needed for Shamoli's cultivation. I've asked Donghe to keep an eye out for it. Not having broken through to Qi Cultivation Realm myself, I'm unsure if we'll manage in time."
"No matter. Now that I am out, I can simply collect it during thunderstorms. After all, it's just unrefined qi and doesn't require much effort," Li Xuanfeng said as he reassured him.
By the time he finished speaking, Lu Wanrong had prepared some tea and had served it in two jade cups for the men.
Li Xuanfeng took a sip and asked with a smile, "How is Yuanxiu managing the household?"
Li Xuanling set down his jade cup, his expression filled with satisfaction as he spoke softly.
"He handles it skillfully, managing to sway all branches of the family. Even those elders who are a constant headache for Xuanxuan have come to praise him to me. He skillfully balances severity and gentleness, fosters closeness among the major and minor branches, and has incited such competition among the external cultivators that their age-old silent agreements have collapsed overnight... This boy manages our household better than either of us ever did!"
Li Xuanfeng was momentarily stunned by Li Xuanling's high praise, then slapped his thigh and exclaimed, "Really?! He was such a quiet kid… I never imagined he'd be so capable!"
Li Xuanling beamed as he spoke of Li Yuanxiu.
"Xiu'er is subtly brilliant. His unassuming appearance often makes people underestimate him, only to find themselves ensnared in his schemes before they realize it. Jiao'er, on the contrary, projects bravery and resolution from the outset. Both brothers are formidable in their own right!"
"Hahahaha!"
After years of separation, Li Xuanfeng and Li Xuanling conversed a while longer before a brief silence fell between them.
Li Xuanfeng reached for his long bow and excused himself with a smile, saying, "I'll go settle the matter regarding the sacrificial beast. The sooner we address the issue, the fewer worries we'll have."
After bidding farewell, he flew out of the cave dwelling and into the mountains.
Watching Li Xuanfeng disappear into the distance, Lu Wanrong murmured, "My brother-in-law is nearly thirty and still hasn't married or had children. It's becoming an issue."
Lu Wanrong had only met Li Xuanfeng a few times and hence did not share a strong bond with her husband's brother. Despite her comment, she felt somewhat relieved deep down. After all, the more children there were in the family, the less attention would be given to her own daughter, Qinghong. Still, as a sister-in-law, it was proper to show concern.
"Indeed," Li Xuanling agreed, showing genuine concern. He then continued, "But that incident was a hard blow to him… I fear he has little inclination to think of marriage right now. We won't be able to persuade him… only Father can."
Li Xuanfeng soared into the air, following the route he had once taken with Li Tongya when they had ambushed the two individuals from Changxiao Gate. After the time taken to burn a stick of incense, he finally landed under a large banyan tree with white leaves.
A large fox was busily digging at something by the tree roots, surrounded by various other foxes that were hopping around. The little ones were unafraid of Li Xuanfeng, even sniffing curiously around his feet.
"Greetings, Senior!" Li Xuanfeng called out, cupping his fist respectfully.
The fox paused in surprise before anxiously asking, "Where's Li Tongya? Why are you here instead? Surely, he hasn't... died out there, has he?"
"The elder is currently in seclusion focusing on his breakthrough, so he sent me here instead," Li Xuanfeng replied reassuringly.
The fox then stood upright, exclaiming nervously, "Is he attempting to attain the Foundation Establishment Realm?! That's a life-and-death trial..."
"My second uncle is now at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. His seclusion is not for attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm," Li Xuanfeng clarified.
The fox calmed down upon hearing this, saying, "Humans really cultivate fast! It takes you just a few years to break through a heavenly layer… soon, he'll surpass me."
After a glance at Li Xuanfeng, the fox said mysteriously, "I heard from the great demons of my clan that the ruler of Mount Yue is about to die of old age… Are you aware of this? Your home borders the mountain region; you should be prepared!"
Li Xuanfeng appreciated the fox's concern for Li Tongya and its prompt advice for the Li Family. He thought to himself, It's funny how the demons of this world often seem more sincere than humans…
Thinking this, Li Xuanfeng responded aloud, "Thank you for the warning, Senior. My family is already aware of it."
"Good to know," the fox huffed, seemingly frustrated at not eliciting a more dramatic reaction from Li Xuanfeng, which seemed to itch its need to share gossip.
Laying down on the ground, the fox then decided to pry further.
"What brings you here?"
"I seek to capture a couple of demon beasts. Do you have any advice for me, Senior?" Li Xuanfeng asked, making the intention of his visit known.
The fox accepted the Spirit Paddies from Li Xuanfeng and smiled, revealing the locations of several demon beasts.
As Li Xuanfeng flew away, the fox stuffed its mouth with the paddies while wagging its tail and chittering to itself happily.
"That's a nice golden bow!"
Li Xuanfeng flew for an hour and came upon a hill shrouded in mist, dotted with fruit trees. Deer and horned horses roamed among them. He peered closely, searching for the creatures he sought.
"The fox mentioned a pack of hyenas here, with two at the Qi Cultivation Realm… but I see nothing, not even a trace of demonic qi! They hide well!"
Li Xuanfeng observed for a while longer and finally spotted a gray hyena sitting on a large rock. It seemed to have attained the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, with robust hind legs and weaker front limbs. Sitting like a child on the rock, it watched the deer below. At first glance, it looked like a child in a gray fur coat.
"Is it... herding?" Li Xuanfeng wondered to himself.
