The big black ox glanced at Chen Xun, then at the Blazing Red Lion, and blinked twice.
The Blazing Red Lion fell silent after hearing this. Flames flickered softly around it, and its expression gradually calmed.
That night, a gray storm swept across the plains. The cold rain was bone-chilling, and the Blazing Red Lion’s kin fell one by one in pools of blood, with almost no survivors.
A thousand years of loneliness and gloom stirred ripples in its heart, expanding uncontrollably, leaving it with no hope for anything good—only the instinct to survive.
It remembered how, as a child, it would sneak out to eat rotting meat in the dead of night, not wanting to disturb the other tribes despite its grievances.
Its features twisted slightly, and with great difficulty, it slowly opened its mouth. "Pre..."
"Lion, why don't you come with us? Old Ox and I haven't seen much of the world either." Chen Xun interrupted, placing a hand on the big black ox. "We don’t like fighting either. We just enjoy wandering around. We won't let you fall into danger."
"Senior, are you trying... to make me your mount?!"
The Blazing Red Lion’s heart sank, and the last glimmer of hope shattered. Thinking it through, it seemed it was only good for being a mount or getting eaten.
Before Chen Xun could speak, the Blazing Red Lion’s eyes flickered with cunning, hiding the last bit of sincerity. "Senior, if that’s your wish, how could I resist? I’m willing to be your mount."
It gradually put on a flattering smile, which looked quite comical on its majestic face.
"Lion, relationships between people, between spirit beasts, and between humans and spirit beasts aren’t just about profit." Chen Xun seemed completely relaxed, as if he had seen through its thoughts. "A Nascent Soul-stage mount? I could have as many as I want."
At this, the Blazing Red Lion was shaken. It glanced at Chen Xun and the big black ox, but they both remained easygoing and calm.
It took a deep breath and asked in a soft, suspicious voice, "So, senior, you mean..."
"Companions, perhaps. We've cultivated for a thousand years, and it seems you're the only fellow cultivator we've met. Haha." Chen Xun raised an eyebrow and laughed heartily. "Old Ox is my sworn brother. We’ve never needed a mount."
"Moo!" The big black ox snorted and joined in the laugh, looking at the Blazing Red Lion with fiery eyes.
The Blazing Red Lion glanced at Chen Xun. He had once said after Liu Yuan’s death, "Meeting, knowing, and walking part of the journey together is the greatest blessing."
"Moo~" The big black ox let out a low call. Chen Xun had indeed changed from before.
This lion’s experiences and actions were quite similar to theirs. In the days ahead, it would certainly be a good match for their adventures—cultivation joy multiplied.
Companion?!
Suddenly, the Blazing Red Lion froze, like a tree struck by lightning, staring blankly at Chen Xun and the big black ox. That word had vanished from its life since its clan was destroyed... among spirit beasts, most relationships were just about mutual benefit.
"Lion, have you ever seen the sea?" Chen Xun smiled. "Ever been on a flying boat? Ever gone fishing at sea?"
The Blazing Red Lion was lost in confusion, as if it hadn’t yet snapped out of its emotions. It instinctively shook its head.
"Though you have no tribe, wandering the great plains will eventually lead to you being hunted. No one will help you." Chen Xun’s gaze grew deep. "But if you board our flying boat, at least when danger comes, Old Ox and I will stand before you."
"Moo!" The big black ox grinned. He and his brother were very strong!
The Blazing Red Lion’s heart trembled, and its breathing quickened. A thousand years of wandering, and who had ever stood before it? Only its kin, during the great catastrophe that destroyed their clan.
The cave fell silent. The Blazing Red Lion said nothing.
Moments later, it forced a smile and said, "Thank you, seniors, for your kindness, but I..."
"Kindness, my ass! You're disrespecting me?!"
"Moo?!"
Chen Xun and the big black ox rose with immense power, shaking the cave with a wave of terrifying spiritual pressure.
Sweating profusely, the Blazing Red Lion felt its scalp tingle. "Senior, I... I’m not good at fighting and can’t help you much!"
"Stop with the nonsense! Are you coming or not?!"
Chen Xun’s roar shook the ground, and with a flash of five-element divine light, the ceiling exploded, opening a large hole.
Cold winds rushed in, and the Blazing Red Lion stood disheveled in the gust, speechless.
Above them, a massive flying boat stood on the grasslands, with a mystical tree swaying in the wind, casting a large shadow on the ground.
The Blazing Red Lion’s eyes widened. So, this was a flying boat. It felt a stirring in its heart.
"Moo!!" The big black ox bellowed. They didn’t invite the lion for its strength.
Chen Xun soared into the sky, landing on the edge of the massive boat. "Lion, instead of wandering alone, why not wander with us?"
"I..." The Blazing Red Lion looked up, lips trembling, its chest heaving.
"Are you coming or not?!"
"Moo?!"
The big black ox also leapt into the sky, standing beside Chen Xun, looking down at the Blazing Red Lion below.
Under the sunlight, the entire flying boat gleamed, and the smiles of the two figures were so clear and radiant.

The flying boat began to rise, stirring up a cloud of dust. The Blazing Red Lion hesitated, taking a step forward but stopping itself.
It could sense the sincerity and power of the two. If they had ill intentions, they could easily kill it now. There was no need for such trouble.
The word "companion" lingered in its mind, but it still couldn’t get past the barriers in its heart.
"What’s taking you so long, Lion? We’re leaving!"
"Moo!!"
Two loud shouts echoed from the sky. The Blazing Red Lion hesitated, still not trusting anyone—survival was all that mattered.
With a resigned look, it gazed at the rising flying boat and shouted, "Thank you for your kindness, seniors, but I..."
"Let’s go!!"
"Moo!!"
Boom!
The five-element divine light shot out from the flying boat, and the Blazing Red Lion was shocked. Its body was enveloped and pulled toward the ascending boat.
"Senior, no!!"
A loud, joyous cry echoed through the sky, followed by a sudden change of tone. "This little lion will be in your care from now on!!! Enough with the nonsense, let’s go!"
"Moo moo!!"
Buzz!
Buzz!
The flying boat fully ascended, its body surrounded by a powerful five-element force, bursting into the divine light and vanishing into the clouds in the blink of an eye, heading swiftly toward The Great Li Realm.
