To the north of the Wu Nation, beyond the desert, lies the Northern Territory. Surrounded by dense forests filled with demonic beasts, this region is shrouded in clouds and mist year-round. Glaciers and towering peaks, thousands of meters high, are interconnected.
Snow-covered lands, glaciers stretching for thousands of miles, and endless drifting snow. The ice valleys crisscross, and the immense elevation differences make the glaciers spectacular, like a kingdom of snow.
Jade dragons dance among the clouds, and towering glaciers reach the sky. This is the Northern Territory, filled with both opportunities and dangers.
Today, the glaciers possess a shattered beauty. The ground and sky are occupied by countless cultivators, standing silently.
The dense crowd of cultivators is divided into three camps.
The accumulated spiritual energy within them seems to have drawn away all the temperature in an instant, creating a coldness akin to an ice age. The light vanishes momentarily.
One person stood in the sky above each of the three factions, exuding overwhelming power, towering above all, causing even the wind and snow to avoid them.
All the cultivators' eyes followed these figures, a cold sweat slightly breaking out on their foreheads as they secretly swallowed hard. This day had finally come.
The Top Ten Sects!
The Three Major Forces!
The vagabond cultivators and the former Wu Nation sect cultivators!
"Chan Yuan, you've finally revealed your true selves, but the Northern Territory is not a place for you," said the Nascent Soul ancestor of the vagabond cultivators indifferently. He was tall and imposing, with bronze skin and distinct, deep features.
His dark, icy eyes appeared wild and untamed, and his attire was peculiar, with a treasure wheel floating behind him.
"So what? It's always been an unspoken understanding, hasn't it, Sikong Qianmu?" The ancestor Chan Yuan of the Top Ten Sects smiled faintly, his figure in the sunlight as dazzling as the brightest star among thousands.
"Brother Chan Yuan's ambition is too great; I cannot agree," said a woman standing in front of the Three Major Forces, with strong eyebrows, radiant presence, and clothes as white as snow, her broad sleeves fluttering.
Chan Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, indifferent to everything: "I don't know when you all joined forces, but it's just another obstacle."
At these words, the cultivators on the ground showed intense shock and disbelief. Even some rogue cultivators were caught up in the war among the three major forces, having just passed by!
Surrounded by large formations, the sky and earth were sealed off. No one could leave without a decisive victory, and the three sides seemed well-prepared for this day.
"The Top Ten Sects seek to dominate everything, but the rules of the cultivation world aren't dictated by anyone's whim," the vagabond ancestor said coldly.
"Chan Yuan, when we agreed to explore together, we knew this day would come," Sikong Qianmu said with a cold smile.
They were more aware than anyone of how the resources of the Qian Nation’s cultivation world had been exhausted.
Their two cultivation worlds had always had different philosophies and were bound to clash, but they also wanted to explore the Northern Territory.
However, for hundreds of years, the depths of the glaciers remained a paradise for demonic and spiritual beasts. They still hadn't fully explored the number of Nascent Soul-level beasts, remaining at an impasse.
Terrifying beast roars came from the depths of the glaciers, at least mid-Nascent Soul level. The depths of the Northern Territory were fraught with deadly danger.
Crossing the peaks from the sky would subject Nascent Soul cultivators to deadly star-devouring winds.
"Ha, indeed." Chan Yuan remained expressionless, "We just can't wait any longer; we need to pave a path for future generations."
Now, all forces in the cultivation world were gathered, awaiting a thousand-year opportunity to annihilate their enemies in one fell swoop, leaving no future trouble.
"Absurd!"
"Wolfish ambition!"
Sikong Qianmu and the vagabond ancestor shouted angrily. Tensions erupted instantly, causing the ground and glaciers to crack with thunderous noise.
"All fellow Daoists, hear my command: this is a struggle for the Dao, do not retreat!" Chan Yuan's aura exploded, his eyes emitting dazzling cold light, filling the world with killing intent.
"Yes, ancestor!"
"Yes, ancestor!"
On the ground and in the sky, Qian Nation’s cultivators shouted thunderously, their faces resolute, carried by the mighty force, their killing intent shaking the heavens and earth.
A chilling, murderous atmosphere suddenly arose in everyone's hearts.
Terrifying energy rippled through the heavy snow, as if it were about to shatter this vast snowy kingdom.
"Fellow Daoists..." Sikong Qianmu's icy light shot in all directions, and a sword of light shone in the void, radiating divine light. "Draw your swords!!!"
"Kill!"
"Kill!"
Hundreds of thousands of cultivators behind her shouted in unison, their voices shaking the mountains and rivers. The immense, grand killing shout instantly drowned out all external sounds.
**Buzz…**
Massive warships slowly emerged from the clouds, like giant beasts descending.
Black shadows spread across the land, covering the sun, eliminating light and heat, and leaving only the endless cold...
The three major forces were fully mobilized for today's battle!
"It's over."
Countless rogue cultivators on the ground were dumbfounded, looking up at the sky, sensing an overwhelming killing intent.
"Who dares to insult the Northern Territory!"
On the battlefield, at this moment, a powerful voice rang out from the surrounding mountains and forests.
Tens of thousands of vagabond cultivators, either flying through the air or dashing on the ground, charged toward the battlefield!
Their wild and strange spiritual energy surged like a long rainbow, spanning across the sky!
"Qian Nation, prepare for a battle!" The vagabond ancestor roared furiously, waving his hand forward in the sky.
At that moment, millions of cultivators from all three sides simultaneously let out a thunderous roar. The fierce air currents and winds caused the rogue cultivators' clothes and hair to flutter wildly...
**Boom!**
**Boom!**
A desolate horn sounded in the Northern Territory, and intense formation lights engulfed the entire battlefield.
The cultivators of the three major forces surged like tides, their eyes emitting a shocking killing light, beginning the official collision!!
This battle was historically known as the Battle of the Heavenly Change in the cultivation world.
...
The years passed beautifully, marked by their inevitable flow. In the blink of an eye, another ten years had passed.
No news had returned from the Northern Territory Battle, but it was undoubtedly more tragic than the battle of the Wu Nation back then.
In the Tian Duan Plains, an unfrequented place, two figures sat quietly on the ground, their eyes vacant, as if watching something.
They were watching the sunrise, preparing to absorb the legendary 'Purple Qi from the East,' the majestic power of heaven and earth, feeling it was a waste not to take it.
"Old Ox, calm your mind and prepare to receive the blessings of heaven and earth." Chen Xun murmured mystically, his eyes half-closed, and his five hearts facing the sky, "Come on, I am ready!"
"Moo moo!!" The big black ox closed its eyes, but its heart was very sincere. They had always had this habit.
The big black ox firmly believed in the merit and the coming of the purple qi. Although it couldn't be seen or touched, such things existed if one believed in them.
It was a kind of seasoning on their cultivation path, as spiritual energy was too monotonous for the long-lived.
After half an hour.
"I can feel the energy of the purple qi." Chen Xun took a deep breath, feeling refreshed. "Old Ox, thank the heavens for their protection and blessings."
"Moo~~~" The big black ox exhaled a long breath, feeling an inexplicable purification of the soul.
"The auspicious time has arrived; I shall open the furnace to refine pills. May the immortals, gods, and Buddhas bless me, Chen Xun Patriarch!" Chen Xun suddenly changed his tone, and an ice-blue pill furnace spiraled into the sky. "Ancestor Ox will surely take care of everyone!"
"Moo?!" The big black ox jumped in surprise. It feared the most when Chen Xun mentioned it in such statements. "Moo moo moo?!"
"Sincerity brings results; Black Ox, sit down." Chen Xun's words were unhurried, his gaze deep and calm. "Do not disrupt my auspicious time."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox reluctantly sat down, muttering to itself. At this moment, it really didn't dare to disturb Chen Xun.
