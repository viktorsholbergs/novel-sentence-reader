The passing of time is elusive for all things, and they were oblivious to the swift passage of time. In the blink of an eye, ten hurried years had passed.
They added their immortal points to their spiritual energy, and now they were at 42. What made them happiest was that the immortal points hadn't reached the threshold, and their spells became increasingly terrifying...
However, the entire Qian Nation Immortal Sect fell into complete calmness, with no disputes even with the Wu Nation. Both sects were filled with an extremely oppressive atmosphere.
Five Elements Sect was slightly better, and everyone minded their own business. It seemed they couldn't reach the same heights as the top ten immortal sects.
Now, Ji Kun's aura was becoming stronger, and he could somewhat grasp the situation between the two countries. He assured Chen Xun that, for the time being, there were no issues, but he didn't know much.
Chen Xun also asked Ji Kun to help him find some body-refining martial arts. He had more connections outside, and there were no such martial arts within the Five Elements Sect.
Ji Kun was shocked and quickly advised Chen Xun to focus on cultivation. Body refining didn't contribute to cultivation, and Chen Xun wasn't involved in direct conflicts.
Although he said so, Chen Xun still accepted Ji Kun's offer. In these years, whenever he went on missions, he paid special attention, but he only brought back some ordinary body-refining techniques.
Chen Xun accepted them seriously and showed no disappointment. He told Ji Kun not to look anymore; these were already enough.
Today, two figures entered the Spiritual Medicine Garden. Both were early Foundation Establishment cultivators, with a solemn look in their eyes.
However, their robes weren't the typical gray of the Five Elements Sect but rather a white-blue color. This represented that they were direct disciples of a peak master, their status equivalent to that of Foundation Establishment Elders and much higher than cultivators like Chen Xun.
"Junior Brother Chen Xun, Black Ox."
Liu Yuan and Shi Jing arched their hands and smiled. Their eyes were also drawn to the scenery of the spiritual medicine garden, overlooking the rolling grassy slopes and the streams running through them.
However, there was surprise in their eyes. Why were there so many materials from the crane spirit trees scattered around...
In the distance, several cave houses still had various colorful stones in front of them, shining brightly as if they were polished daily.
They thought Chen Xun would live a serene life, but seeing the chicken and pig pens in the distance, they realized they were wrong, just like Junior Brother Chen Xun back then.
The gentle breeze gradually came, causing countless green grasses to bow to the ground. Two figures with straw hats appeared in this picturesque scene. Chen Xun, with a smile in his eyes, walked towards them with the big black ox.
"Haha, Senior Brothers Shi and Liu, is there something going on?" Chen Xun laughed loudly. In the previous years, they had come to see him and the big black ox once after reaching the Foundation Establishment, but it was outside the spiritual medicine garden, and they left in a hurry.
"Moo moo~" The big black ox responded with a playful expression.
"We've come to bid farewell to Junior Brother Chen Xun."
Shi Jing spoke, his eyes showing a strange color. They always felt that Chen Xun's temperament was quite special, with an indescribable charm.
"Farewell? Are you going to a faraway place?" Chen Xun asked the two while taking off his hat. He knew that many Foundation Establishment cultivators had to leave the sect to seek opportunities.
"Yes, we're going to the Qian Nation Imperial City to resolve some worldly matters." Shi Jing nodded gently. He had become much more stable, but underneath that handsome exterior, he seemed even more charming.
"Senior Brother Shi and I both come from the Imperial City. Our families have some connections with the Five Elements Sect." Liu Yuan said it with some melancholy. Like the big black ox, sorrow was hidden in her eyes.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were surprised. These were big shots from the mortal world! The highest official they had seen was the magistrate of the county office.
"Senior Brother Shi, Senior Sister Liu, this is great news. You can visit your home." Chen Xun smiled and spoke. Why did they feel that their emotions weren't running high?
"Senior Brother's order, from now on, we will part ways between immortals and mortals."
Both spoke in unison, their eyes showing a struggle.
"Junior Brother Chen Xun, when walking the path of immortality, must you sever all worldly connections..."
Liu Yuan asked with a hint of melancholy, looking up at Chen Xun. She thought of her mother. "They're still alive..."
Chen Xun was surprised. Mortal dignitaries! They had seen the highest-ranking officials in their world.
Shi Jing also turned his gaze towards Chen Xun, his eyes showing a bit of anticipation. They had recently reached Foundation Establishment and didn't quite understand the intentions of their Master.
"Moo?"
The big black ox also turned its head to look at Chen Xun. In its heart, it vaguely understood why Chen Xun chose the path of cultivating immortality. After all, Chen Xun used to enjoy staying in the mortal realm, even finding joy in blacksmithing.
"Hehe, profound indeed, profound indeed. How can I have as much experience as your Master? She won't harm you, after all."
Under the anticipation of three pairs of eyes, they didn't expect Chen Xun to unexpectedly say such words with a smile.
Both of them sighed faintly. Liu Yuan then changed the subject, pursing her lips and saying, "Junior Brother Chen Xun, do you want to accompany us to the imperial city? The Qian Nation’s imperial dynasty is vast."
This was their true purpose in coming here, inviting Chen Xun and the big black ox to join them on their journey.
"Moo!" The big black ox widened its eyes. The imperial city of the Qian Nation—wouldn't that be even larger than Panning City?
"Senior Brother, Senior Sister, where is the imperial city of the Qian Nation?" Chen Xun also widened his eyes and asked. He and the big black ox hadn't been to many significant places yet.
Moreover, the imperial city of the Qian Nation was undoubtedly larger than Panning City. In his past life, he hadn't even been to the capital, leaving a great regret in his heart.
"In the Jin Feng Province, two provinces away from the Zhi Yang Province. The journey is long. If Junior Brother Chen Xun accompanies us, you can experience the local customs along the way."
Shi Jing's eyes revealed hope. Junior Brother Chen Xun was a quite interesting and amiable person, and they both hoped to travel with him and the big black ox.
"Moo moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, still contemplating.
"Senior Brother Shi, Senior Sister Liu, it's not that I deliberately want to disappoint you."
Chen Xun's expression was also struggling as he regretfully said, "The Ox and I have formulated a cultivation plan, and we can't temporarily break away now. We've already stretched one stick of incense into two."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox nodded earnestly towards the two. This was true.
"Such as how to combine the Fireball Technique with the Ice Sphere Technique, and the profound differences in the operation of various Foundation Establishment martial arts in the body are significant issues."
"How to stack these miniature formations is also essential. Most importantly, if it's not too much trouble, could you please bring me a map of the Qian Nation."
Chen Xun said with a cupped hand, his tone carrying a mix of solemnity, expectation, and sincerity.
The two originally listened attentively, thinking that Junior Brother Chen Xun was really working hard. They had never thought of these issues but were suddenly brought back to reality by his last sentence.
Shi Jing had just been about to become fascinated, but he smiled awkwardly and said, "Junior Brother Chen, you're being too polite. Leave the matter of the map to us."
"Junior Brother Chen Xun, Senior Brother Shi have a high status." Liu Yuan covered her face and chuckled lightly. She always acted like a cute little girl.
"That's great. I was afraid of troubling you too much."
Chen Xun breathed a sigh of relief, and he smiled, "However, if there's a chance in the future, we can travel together."
"Then it's a deal, Junior Brother Chen Xun!"
"Junior Brother Chen Xun, I've remembered what you said. Black Ox, you heard that too!"
"Moo moo!!"
"Hahaha..."
Chen Xun laughed heartily, took a few steps forward, and said, "Then, I wish you a smooth journey. But as I'm older than you, let me give you a piece of advice."
"Junior Brother, please speak." Both of them solemnly clasped their hands, their eyes burning.
"When in doubt, run away!"
Chen Xun said seriously, with his hands behind his back. He looked up at the sky at a 45-degree angle, and this was absolutely an essential life lesson.
Shi Jing and Liu Yuan were stunned after hearing this. Then, they looked at each other with a smile between their brows, "Yes... Junior Brother Chen."
After bidding farewell, they began their journey back home.
Chen Xun and the big black ox watched them leave. After a while, Chen Xun closed the barrier, and the narrow path began to fill with mist.
