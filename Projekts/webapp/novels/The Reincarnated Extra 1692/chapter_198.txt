Gathered Around the Campfire ③
* * *
When living, unexpected events often occur.
If you don’t always keep that in mind and be prepared, you’ll expose a fatal opening.
For example, in battle…… what if an enemy you thought only had close combat means suddenly unleashed a large-scale magic that scorches a wide area?
If you’re not prepared, you can’t avoid taking a heavy blow, right?
At worst, you’ll die.
So it’s very important to approach things with the mindset that anything can happen.
Even children understand that without being told.
But if asked whether you can live constantly on guard for anything to happen, even I can’t do that.
Especially recently, with the base development progressing and the number of people increasing, the safety has also improved, so I inevitably let my guard down while acting inside the base.
I was careless.
So I was completely surprised.
“””””Emi, happy 9th birthday!!!!”””””
When everyone suddenly said that to me while gathered around the campfire.
“Here, here! Hurry up and sit down, sit down!”
The drunk woman pats my back, frozen in surprise by the sudden event.
“……Drunk woman.”
“It’s Niese. I haven’t been drinking alcohol lately, so I shouldn’t smell anymore, right?”
“What about the bucket? What should I do with the bucket?”
Right, I was told to go draw water from the well because we needed water, so I left my seat with the drunk woman.
That’s why I’m holding a bucket now.
“Who cares about that! Here, just put it down somewhere!”
I see, I should just put it down somewhere.
Um, um……
“Where’s somewhere? That’s right, should I go hunting? Do you need meat?”
“……What are you talking about?”
“My, she’s quite confused, isn’t she!”
The perverted old geezer laughed loudly.
“I’ll take care of the bucket. Miss, sit in front of the campfire.”
“Dirty and shaggy.”
“It’s Modokin. Miss, I always think your nicknames are a bit too harsh, you know?”
The dirty and shaggy guy took my bucket, so I awkwardly walked over and sat in front of the campfire.
My mind is filled with questions, my thoughts are frozen, and I continue to expose an opening.
Emotions hinder normal thinking.
Joy.
The feeling of happiness takes away all the fuel needed to move my head, so I can’t take the necessary actions.
I just silently stare at the flames of the campfire with an expressionless face.
The flames dance in the darkness of the night, swaying, swaying, looking like they’re having fun without thinking about anything.
<……Emi…… Emi, can you hear me? Are you okay?>
……Huh!?
O-Oh, Extra-sama!?
W-What am I doing right now!?
<Calm down, Emi. You were just surprised by the sudden birthday celebration and frozen stiff.>
I-I see!
I was surprised by the sudden birthday celebration and frozen stiff!
Frozen stiff from the surprise of a sudden birthday!
Surprised and stiff with a sudden birthday!
<……You’re still a ditz. Take deep breaths, deep breaths.>
“Suuuuu…… Fuuuuuuu~……”
Alright, I’ve calmed down a bit.
Now that I’m calm, let’s sort out the current situation.
I’m having my birthday celebrated by everyone at the base right now.
I understand that situation.
But I have one question.
“Why did you think today is my birthday?”
I ask the old man.
Most likely, the mastermind behind this celebration is the old man.
The proof is that the old man has a big smile on his face because the surprise was successful.
His base face is that of a villain, so it looks very sinister, but for the old man, that’s his attempt at a kind smile.
“Well, I don’t know if today is really your birthday.”
Huh?
“But you mentioned somewhere that you were born around autumn. So I thought I’d celebrate at a good timing during autumn. You’re not the type to remember the exact date of your birthday anyway, right? What’s important is the feeling of wanting to celebrate.”
“I see.”
<No, that’s not right! Even if Emi doesn’t remember, I was the only one who properly remembered your birthday and counted the days to celebrate it! Celebrating Emi’s birthday was my privilege!>
Ahaha, Extra-sama is frustrated.
By the way, when is my exact birthday?
<It’s tomorrow!>
Whoa, so close.
“Foooh~~~! Now that Emi-chan is back to normal, here’s our present! Darmacy!”
“Uooooh!”
Following the perverted old geezer’s instructions, the noisy muscle lifts the wooden box behind him high!
That wooden box wasn’t there earlier.
They were hiding it.
Now, the noisy muscle places that wooden box in front of the campfire with a thud.
It’s quite heavy.
“Now, take a look, Emi-chan! This is the first unveiling today! What’s planned to become a specialty of the Zamago Forest…!”
The perverted old geezer and the decently blond guy slowly open the lid of the wooden box together.
Inside, there was……
“Demon realm-style smoked Zamago Toad~~~!”
“O-Ooh!”
I inadvertently let out an exclamation of admiration!
Judging from the shape, it’s probably the hind leg of a Zamago Toad, and that smoked meat, which is about the size of my body, is a beautiful golden color.
It’s sparkling, illuminated by the flames of the campfire!
And above all, the fragrant, appetite-stimulating aroma that reaches my nose even though I should be sitting across the campfire……!
What is this smell, it smells delicious!
It’s a scent I’ve never smelled before!
“We tried various ingredients from this forest and came up with a smoked dish unique to this place!”
The old man explains proudly.
Ah, come to think of it, the old man and the others were doing something, smoking in the corner of the base.
They were making this!
Not letting me near was also for the sake of this surprise!?
<And also to prevent Emi from snacking on it.>
I’m ignoring whatever Extra-sama is saying!
“Originally, it was planned as a preserved food for winter, but it turned out to be quite a wonderful product. I thought this could be sufficiently sold as a commodity when trading with the outside in the future……”
The old man is also saying something, but that doesn’t reach my ears either.
I can’t take my eyes off the golden smoked meat anymore!
Seeing me like that, the old man smiled wryly and gave up on his explanation.
“Well, that’s fine. Anyway, this is how the best smoked meat was completed. This meat is our present to you. You like meat, right?”
“I like meat.”
“You’re drooling, drooling, drool is overflowing…… Well, it’s too pitiful to keep you waiting any longer. Patchino, the grill.”
“Of course I’ve already prepared it, Giovanno-san!”
The decently blond guys set up a grill over the campfire.
The perverted old geezer thinly slices the smoked meat with a knife and places it on the grill.
Fat drips down with a sizzling sound, making a nice noise.
Ah, the aroma, the aroma…… the aroma is amazing.
Delicious, delicious, delicious!
“Alright, it’s done!”
The decently blond guy says that while skewering the even more fragrantly grilled sliced smoked meat and handing it to me.
Ah, ah, ah!
I don’t have to hold back anymore, right? Right!?
ITADAKIMAAASU!!! (Thank you for the food!!!)
“Ah, idiot! Who eats the skewer too!”
“Hey Miss, are you okay!?”
“It’s making a serious crunching sound…… no good, she’s not listening.”
“Well, she’ll be fine…… it’s Emi-chan after all.”
“Uooooh!”
What is this, it’s so delicious!!!
Meat overflowing with umami with every bite!
A unique, but increasingly addictive good aroma!
The perfect texture!
“How is it, Emi?”
The old man has a really proud face.
I have no choice but to say this……
“The best……”
And!!!
<As much as I hate to admit it, I have to acknowledge this…… I’ll forgive them for stealing Emi’s birthday from me with this.>
My birthday wasn’t stolen, and it wasn’t yours to begin with, Extra-sama.
“Foooh~~~! Now, you can eat the meat while we move on to the next part! Next is the entertainment!”
Now, the perverted old geezer stood up energetically!
“My hometown Nuidosten is a country of flames with a deep faith in the fire god! Therefore, it’s a standard to always have fire-based entertainment at celebratory occasions!”
While saying that, the perverted old geezer took off his clothes, becoming topless, and started some kind of dance I didn’t quite understand next to the campfire.
His movements, swaying his body back and forth, are very funny to watch.
“Wahaha!”
“Funny! Is that a pervert dance!?”
“Don’t say such blasphemous things! It’s a sacred dance offered to the gods!”
The perverted old geezer’s dance is a big hit, and the place gets very lively!
“Now, the preparations are complete! What we’re about to perform is! Emi-chan, probably for your upcoming 9th birthday! Wishing for your healthy growth in the future! The fire-walking dedication ceremony~~~!!”
“Eh!? Seriously!?”
“Fire-walking, will the old geezer be okay!?”
“Uooooh!?”
The decently blond guys express shocked expressions at the perverted old geezer’s sudden declaration!
“Of course, I’ll be fine!”
The perverted old geezer nods with full confidence.
“Now go, Patchino! Take off your shoes and splendidly walk across this campfire~~~!!”
“You mean me!? I’m the one walking!?”
“Wahaha!”
“Go! Go! Patchino!”
“There’s no way I can do that!!”
“Uooooh!”
“Ah! Darmacy went!”
“Amazing! Darmacy is amazing!”
“””Darmacy! Darmacy! Darmacy!”””
“Uooooh!!!”
“Hey! Wait, what’s with this flow! What about me? What’s my role!? What should I do at this point!?”
“””Darmacy! Darmacy! Darmacy!”””
“Don’t ignore meeee!!!”
I sit by the campfire and intently watch everyone’s silly commotion.
Before I knew it, the old man was sitting right next to me, roughly ruffling my hair as usual.
The fun night passes by noisily like this.
Starting tomorrow, I’ll be 9 years old.
Happy 9th birthday!
