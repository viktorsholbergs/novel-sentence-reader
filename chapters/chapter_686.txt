The person who arrived was Xiao Yuansi. His expression was gentle and his cultivation had already reached its peak. Merely standing there, he exuded a faint medicinal fragrance. The cloud patterns on his cuffs were a light golden hue and his demeanor was warm. He said, “No need to be so polite…”
Li Ximing had gone to the Xiao Family several times to seek him but each time he returned empty-handed. Later, the Xiao Family sealed the mountain which made it even harder to see Xiao Yuansi. Now, feeling sentimental, Li Ximing asked several questions in succession, “How is Master’s cultivation now? Are you preparing to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm?!”
“Still lacking a bit of refinement,” Xiao Yuansi responded warmly to each question.
During the short time Xiao Yuansi had been present, Li Xijun had already begun to speculate, thinking, It seems that Mu Moli and Ju Wu were lured out by the Man On Creek. The Xiao Family specifically made this trip, so they must have some intentions.
The Li Family’s trip was only to Mount Wu, what else was there that could be worth Xiao Chuting sending people over? The white-clothed youth shook his sleeves and first expressed his gratitude, “Many thanks for your assistance, senior.”
Xiao Yuansi waved his hand lightly. Whether they were thanking him for effortlessly capturing Mu Moli or for luring both man and beast out of the mountain, both parties understood in their hearts. Then, Li Xijun smiled and said, “I was troubled, unsure of the taboos and depths of Mount Wu. Since you are passing through, senior, I hope you can offer some guidance.”
“Alright, then let’s go take a look together.” Xiao Yuansi glanced at him in surprise, chuckled softly, and agreed, saying, “Speaking with Xijun is truly like a refreshing spring breeze.”
Xiao Yuansi paused for a moment. He could no longer hold the crimson light, which Mu Moli transformed into, in his hand. The crimson light then transformed into a bare head attached to a short segment of spine. Mu Moli opened his mouth and was going to beg for mercy.
Xiao Yuansi placed a finger on the center of his eyebrows. In an instant, Mu Moli lost his consciousness and drifted into a hazy dreamlike state. With a flick of his sleeve, Mu Moli melted into it like snow under sunlight.
After casting a spell to take him in, Xiao Yuansi finally spoke with slight apology, “Our Daoist Master has some matters to inquire about regarding Mount Yue.”
At this point, Li Ximing understood that Xiao Yuansi had come specifically for Mount Wu. He traveled with the wind and soon saw a narrow-eyed monk also flying over, golden light forming into a bundle of chains, tightly binding a panther-like demon.
Ju Wu had only managed to escape a few miles before Kongheng had already been waiting nearby. The demonic beast had suffered some minor injuries and had no chance of escaping from the Master Monk’s grasp. In just a moment, it was captured and brought back.
“The Master Monk has arrived,” said Li Ximing, stepping forward to greet him.
Xiao Yuansi glanced at Kongheng and said softly, “Take this demonic beast into the formation. It may be of use.”
Kongheng glanced at Li Xijun and gave a slight nod before silently landing beside the group and replied, “Kongheng greets the senior.”
Xiao Yuansi nodded and looked at the pitch-black formation beneath his feet. Li Xijun brought Ju Wu forward and said in a deep voice, “Open the grand formation.”
Ju Wu stiffened his neck but couldn’t utter a word. His fierce expression masked his inner fear. Li Xijun glanced at him twice, then pointed to Xiao Yuansi and spoke softly, “This is Senior Xiao of the immortal family at the Purple Mansion Realm, a nephew of the Daoist Master. Even if Jiao Zhongzi returns for revenge, he will still fall into the hands of the Daoist Master, so there is no need to worry.”
Seeing the change in Ju Wu’s expression, he continued saying, “Or is Jiao Zhongzi currently in seclusion overseas, attempting to break through to the Purple Mansion Realm? Do you think he can succeed?”
Ju Wu’s expression shifted several times. Jiao Zhongzi had been missing for years and Ju Wu truly had no idea where he was. Looking at the group’s demeanor, Mu Moli was likely dead. This demon had some relation with Mu Moli. With its friend slain, it sorrowfully shut its mouth and was unwilling to speak.
Li Xijun drew his sword and pressed it against Ju Wu’s neck with the icy blade biting into its skin. With that, Ju Wu immediately spoke, “To enter and exit this formation, a shamanic talisman is required. I have it on me. Loosen my bindings slightly and I will retrieve it for the Exalted Immortal.”
Among the cultivators present, any one of them could take his life. Li Xijun wasn’t worried about him playing tricks, so he signaled Kongheng to loosen the restriction. Ju Wu swept his gaze over the group and then looked at the Purple Mansion immortal descendant standing with his hands behind his back.
He opened his panther-like mouth, extended his blood-colored tongue and spat out a brown shamanic talisman. With a command toward the pitch-black formation, the mist dissipated instantly and revealed the great mountain hidden within.
Li Xijun nodded slightly. They could have forcefully broken through the formation but by taking this indirect approach, they preserved this rare shamanic array. This way, there would be no need to construct another grand formation to protect the mountain in the future.
As they drew closer to the mountain, the surrounding magical winds dissipated and made it feel as if they had sunk into quicksilver. With the grand formation now open, Ju Wu’s mentality shifted and he hastily explained, “Mount Wu once housed a supreme treasure. Over the years, mulberry trees have grown everywhere and the spiritual energy here has become heavy. When immortal arts are used here, the clarity of their essence is greatly diminished. The most affected is the art of wind-riding.”
“That must be Answers to a Beggar’s Questions Under the Mulberry Tree!” Xiao Yuansi frowned slightly. He possessed a flying shuttle which was a dharma artifact, meaning he wasn’t necessarily unable to fly here. However, considering the others, he spoke gently, “Let’s go up from the foot of the mountain and take a look.”
They descended toward the foot of the mountain and indeed saw the land covered in mulberry and pagoda trees, forming a dark landscape. White jade steps lined the mountain with spring water gushing forth, flowing in a stream of translucent green. The sound of rushing water echoed around them. The many jade stones bore the marks of time, their luster dimmed, revealing an ancient aura.
Li Ximing praised the sight. As the group ascended the steps, they reached a platform. Li Xijun, holding his sword, swept the area with his spiritual sense and saw below them a group of swine-like creatures sprawled haphazardly.
These creatures lay limp, their eyes were vacant and devoid of intelligence. Around their necks were jade collars engraved with formation patterns that were glowing faintly. Their bodies were bare and covered in various markings.
Their cultivation realms varied, some were at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, others as high as late stage Qi Cultivation Realm. However, all of them lay there mindlessly, dazed and unresponsive.
Seeing the group’s silence, Ju Wu stepped forward awkwardly and explained, “Shamanic spell arts often require blood sacrifices. These were… specifically raised… as offerings.”
Kongheng, having traveled extensively and seen much, had encountered such things often in the north. His eyes shut tightly, his face showing faint anger as he said gravely, “Human livestock.”
Li Xijun remained silent. So-called human livestock were akin to consumables like rice meat and blood slices. They were often made from cultivators, refined using various spiritual materials and alchemical substances. Finally becoming what they now saw.
“Judging by this, the Qi Cultivation Realm cultivators of Northern Mount Yue are all here.” Li Xijun responded softly, “Northern Mount Yue does not harvest resentment qi and blood qi. Instead, they stack up Qi Cultivation through sheer numbers of people, only to later turn them into human livestock…”
Xiao Yuansi glanced at the scene but remained silent. He gently lifted his sleeve and shook out a medicine cauldron.
The cauldron was entirely gray-white, appearing extremely sturdy. A gust of gray wind rose from its mouth, stirring among the human livestock. Screams erupted as flesh and skin flew in all directions, exposing eerie white bones. Chunks of meat peeled off the pig-like creatures’ faces, and eyeballs rolled to the ground.
In just a few seconds, their skin and flesh were stripped away. In the next, they dissolved into pools of blood. Another few seconds later, even their bones were reduced to dust.
Xiao Yuansi formed a seal with his fingers once more. The blood on the ground surged toward the cauldron and was swallowed cleanly by it. The jade surface beneath was left pristine, without a single trace. It was as if the human livestock had never existed.
What a remarkable dharma artifact…
The two brothers exchanged a glance. Kongheng let out a soft sigh and said warmly, “Shangqi Xun Wind… Such masterful technique, senior.”
Xiao Yuansi shook his head, seemingly lost in thought. He continued walking up the jade steps, where he soon encountered a vast jade wall along the cliffside.
The wall was covered with carvings of numerous spells. Some for transformation, others for blood sacrifices, venom curses, or hexes. Most required blood qi, resentment qi, or sacrificial offerings to cast. These were all of Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation Realms. They were of little use to cultivators at the Foundation Establishment Realm.
Ju Wu quickly explained, “Over the past centuries, Duanmu Kui occasionally had the whim to teach shamanic spells. There were six times in total. Everything he taught is recorded on this wall.”
