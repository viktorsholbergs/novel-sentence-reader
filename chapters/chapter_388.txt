On Lijing Peak.
Li Yuanjiao and his group returned to the peak, sending Tian Youdao and An Zheyan off, one to Xianyou Peak and the other back to Cloud Crowned Peak to survey the situation and gather news. Li Yuanjiao personally helped Li Xuanxuan into the cave dwelling to treat his injuries while the remaining cultivators returned to their respective peaks.
Li Yuanping hurried up to check on Li Xuanxuan, personally tending to him for a while. Li Qinghong called over Li Xicheng and Li Xijun, informing them of what had happened to Li Yuanyun, and they waited for the chaos in the marketplace to subside before they could search for his remains.
The two brothers, grieving their father's death, were naturally filled with sorrow. Li Qinghong, having experienced numerous life-and-death separations herself, understood their pain the most and did not allow them to dwell on it. She gave them heavy and tedious tasks to occupy them before hurrying down the mountain.
The greatest loss in the disaster at Cloud Crowned Peak's marketplace was naturally borne by the Xiao Family. As Li Xuanxuan lay unconscious and recovering, Li Yuanjiao and Li Qiuyang estimated that the Xiao Family had probably lost dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators and about ten Qi Cultivators.
The loss of these ten Qi Cultivators was not significant, as most were external and guest cultivators of the Xiao Family, with few true Xiao Family members. However, the loss of those dozens of Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators, including some true Xiao Family heirs sent down to gain experience, was substantial, and it was uncertain how many had escaped.
As for the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, Chen Taojing, who fought against four opponents, although protected by the Boundless Ocean, it was easy for him to defend himself but hard for him to escape, thus he was likely dead.
Next were the various families of Lixia Prefecture and the rogue cultivators in the marketplace. Most of the families in Lixia Prefecture were vassals of the Xiao Family, also suffering losses in this disaster.
The Xiao Family had a significant influence, controlling two-fifths of Lixia Prefecture. Most of the remaining families were directly or indirectly controlled by the Xiao Family. Even the families on the eastern shore of Moongaze Lake, bordering Lixia Prefecture, were mostly under the Xiao's control, and many had suffered losses in the marketplace attack.
"As for the rogue cultivators, this disaster might have severed many lineages..." Li Yuanjiao sighed inwardly, puzzled. "But the Xiao Family is an important ally of the Azure Pond Sect, and the devil plague is said to be the dogs of the Azure Pond Sect… How could the Xiao Family be caught off guard and bitten so hard by the devil cultivators?" he continued, muttering to himself.
He stroked his sword at his waist, murmuring quietly, "Either the Azure Pond Sect has fallen out with the Xiao Family, or the devil cultivators have gone rogue... or perhaps someone from the three sects and seven gates interfered, altering the overall situation."
Recalling the hints given by Yuan Tuan when she visited the Li Family, Li Yuanjiao dismissed these speculations. "If the devil cultivators spread out in Lixia Prefecture, it will be our Moongaze Lake that suffers," he mumbled, understanding the situation.
Feeling anxious, he wondered whether to take another pill to break through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm when the stone door in front of him rumbled open, interrupting his thoughts. Li Xuanxuan hurried out.
Li Xuanxuan had changed into a clean robe and most of his burn scars had healed, though his eyes still had a grayish hue. He looked emaciated and haggard, lacking his former solemn and dignified appearance.
"What about that monkey?!"
Li Xuanxuan's first question upon waking was about the obedient spirit beast he had brought back, causing Li Yuanjiao to smile wryly.
Turning to a nearby family soldier, he gave a command.
"Go bring that spirit beast here."
Li Yuanjiao watched Li Xuanxuan eagerly, who had been the head of the family for many years. Li Xuanxuan understood the unspoken request and happily took off the storage pouch from his waist, saying with a smile, "Let's see what we have gathered!"
The family's finances had been in poor shape for many years, so both Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanping were keenly interested in what Li Xuanxuan had managed to collect during the disaster at the market. They both nodded eagerly.
Rustle…
Li Xuanxuan reached into the storage pouch and poured out a stream of treasures, most of which he had taken from the storage pouch of the dual-wielding cultivator. The rest included a few robes and some pills.
The dharma artifacts were all of the Qi Cultivation Realm. There were four low-grade and inferior-grade artifacts, which were not worth mentioning. The highlight was a medium-grade artifact, a large oval-shaped earth-yellow shield called the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, a well-crafted item known for its sturdiness.
As for how they knew its name and origin, the shield's edge had a small inscription on it that said, "Six-Stone Cloud Plate, medium grade, Yuanwu Peak, forged by Yu Muxian."
"This..?!"
Both men were rendered speechless by the discovery. It was the first time they learned that the term medium grade referred to the mid-stage of Qi Cultivation Realm within the sect.
Li Yuanjiao hefted the Six-Stone Cloud Plate, finding it light and handy, and remarked, "It is indeed the work of an old acquaintance… Yu Muxian does have some skill indeed."
"After all, it is from the long-lost Molten Metal Cave technique," Li Xuanxuan said quietly as he heard many rumors in the market. He stored the Six-Stone Cloud Plate away and brought out a pair of twin blades.
These twin blades were also medium-grade, and they were flat and thin. Without the devil cultivator's mana, they showed a faint blue-green hue. They examined them for a while but found no signature, indicating they were not from the three sects and seven gates.
Li Yuanjiao swung the blades, which emitted a thin blue blade qi. It was thinner and sharper than sword qi, requiring specific skills to wield it properly.
"Let's call them Azure Blades."
The Li Family's collection of Qi Cultivation Realm artifacts was limited, with none of medium grade until now. The Azure Blades were a pair of artifacts, significantly increasing their value. Naturally, Li Yuanjiao carefully noted them down and stored them away, considering their potential future use.
The form of each dharma artifact determined the reach and range of its qi and aura, each with its own characteristics. Having a variety of different weapons in the family's repertoire was greatly beneficial.
"There is also the large hammer that Qinghong has. I wonder what grade it is," Li Xuanxuan said thoughtfully. After sorting through the dharma artifacts, he set aside the pills and picked up a jade slip from the table, marveling at it.
"It is strange that this devil cultivator carried his legacy so openly. Perhaps he had no fixed residence and nowhere else to store it," he mused.
Li Yuanjiao scoffed and offered a different perspective.
"If not for this, how could devil cultivators grow so rapidly in Jiangnan? They probably copied countless copies and spread them widely. It is no wonder they have several copies in their storage pouch!"
Li Xuanxuan found this explanation reasonable. He had seen the bizarre resilience of devil cultivators with their numerous backup plans, unafraid of damaging their bodies or their cultivation. Many rogue cultivators, unable to resist temptation, naturally turned to the devil cultivation in droves.
He placed his spiritual sense into the jade slip, and a few large characters appeared in his mind: Blood Dharma Manual. Annotated by Anonymous. Part One.
Li Xuanxuan dared not delve deeper, merely noting the title mentally. He was puzzled and mumbled, "Blood Dharma Manual... Why does this name sound so familiar?"
