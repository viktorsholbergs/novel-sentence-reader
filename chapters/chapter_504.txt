Li Xijun and Kongheng rode the wind southward, traversing through Mushroom Forest Plain with Li Xuanxuan flying closely behind them.
Suddenly, Li Xijun recalled something and pulled Kongheng aside. "Master Monk, since you're using Thunderpool as an opportunity to cultivate, why didn't you mention it earlier?" he whispered.
"I have heard that Jiangnan was dangerous so I truly didn't dare to take the risk as my cultivation technique is of a high grade. While your esteemed family suspects I harbor ill intentions, I'm also afraid you might rob me and kill me…" Kongheng admitted, rubbing his smooth bald head.
He opened his narrow eyes and let out a sigh before continuing, "Allow me to clarify, fellow Daoist... The cultivation method I practice requires the nine thunders of heaven and earth. However, the fruition attainment of this cultivation technique is still suspended between heaven and earth, and the thunders I require are difficult to locate. Only when a thunder cultivator breaks through can one of the nine thunders be born during the establishment of the immortal foundation.
"Before the elder of my temple passed away, he spent a considerable time deducing the future and finally learned that one of these thunders would be born in Jiangnan within the next hundred years. He advised me to come here and also predicted a calamity that could help hone my mind..."
He then lowered his gaze, adding softly, "Fellow Daoist Yuanjiao always doubts me, but to be honest… My Liao River Temple is even worse off than your esteemed family. After the Abbot's passing… I've felt like a lost dog, with nowhere to turn."
Li Xijun nodded slightly, feeling a sense of alertness rise within him. "How long has it been since the elder of your esteemed temple passed away?" he asked.
"It has been... more than forty years," Kongheng replied.
Li Xijun calculated silently, realizing that this was around the time when Lingyanzi from the Purple Smoke Gate fled to his home, where his ancestor rescued him and their family acquired the Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique.
"More than forty years... Jiangnan now has several thunder cultivators. If this is part of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's scheme, it must have been laid down more than forty years ago..."
Although Li Xijun had never seen Lingyanzi, he had read about him in the Family History and knew that Li Tongya was the one who dealt with him back then.
Lingyanzi... could not have deceived the ancestor. This means Lingyanzi might be unaware that he has inadvertently become someone else's pawn… Purple Smoke Gate… Could this be the scheme of their Daoist Master?
He then asked, "Master Monk, do you know of Thundercloud Temple?"
Kongheng shook his head slightly, indicating that he did not know. Li Xijun contemplated this information.
It seems I must find an opportunity to visit the Purple Smoke Gate and speak with Lingyanzi, he resolved silently.
Li Xijun guessed the worst possible scenario and thought to himself, The abbot of the Liao River Temple likely deduced that Lingyanzi and the others would bring this item from Thundercloud Temple, so he sent Kongheng out into the mountains!
As Li Xijun mulled over this silently, they had already passed through Changxiao Gate's Helin Prefecture. They landed in the mountains at the other end of the prefecture and took a brief respite.
Li Xijun harnessed the power of his eye technique and noted the swirling snow qi as he surveyed the landscape. He then said softly, "This should be the place. We just crossed Mount Quanwu, and ahead lies the Helin Mountain Range, where the earth veins converge and several types of water veins described in the Chilling Snow Series meet."
The purpose of this trip was a mix of both truth and deception; on the surface, Li Xijun was here to gather cold water.
Li Xuanxuan wore a gray coat and followed behind with a stern expression.
Kongheng gazed at the beauty of the mountains and rivers before him, exclaiming, "Jiangnan is indeed rich in water veins!"
Li Xijun nodded in agreement, then turned to Li Xuanxuan and said respectfully,
"Granduncle, you've also read the Chilling Snow Series while on the way here. The Helin Mountain Range is vast. We should split up to search for it; we might find it sooner that way."
Li Xuanxuan nodded at the suggestion. Li Xijun then looked at Kongheng and said, "Although the spiritual energy in the Helin Mountain Range isn't particularly strong, and there are no famous spirit items or demonic creatures, there may still be some roaming devil cultivators. I would appreciate it if Master Monk could keep an eye out for them while my granduncle and I scout the area."
"Sure," Kongheng replied.
Seeing that Li Xijun was acting thoughtfully and methodically, Li Xuanxuan nodded approvingly before choosing a direction to start his search.
After watching him leave, Li Xijun turned to Kongheng, saying, "Master Monk, please keep an eye on my family's elder while I head to Hengdong Prefecture."
Kongheng nodded in agreement and offered him a few words of advice.
Li Xijun then rode the wind northward, passing through the two large mountains of the Helin Mountain Range as he made his way to Hengdong Prefecture of the Hengzhu Dao Gate.
As soon as he flew out of Helin Prefecture, he was greeted by a vast plain that was peppered with clusters of buildings and pavilions of various sizes. Hengdong Prefecture was a large place with millions of inhabitants, overseen by Hengzhu Dao Gate for many years, making it one of the most affluent prefectures in Yue State.
After flying for a while and taking in the view of the expansive and fertile fields around him, Li Xijun felt puzzled.
"Hengzhu Dao Gate… has no immortal mountain?" he wondered aloud.
As he was contemplating this, a figure approached from the front, gliding effortlessly on a cloud. Dressed in white adorned with gold and red cloud patterns, the person had thin lips and large eyes below long brow bones that set him apart from typical Jiangnan people.
"Greetings, fellow Daoist… I am Bi Chengjuan from the Hengzhu Dao. May I ask which sect or gate you represent?"
Bi Chengjuan's deep eyes and sharp nose made it difficult to read his expression. After scrutinizing Li Xijun from head to toe, he quickly deduced that Li Xijun did not belong to any of the three sects or seven gates. However, he chose to phrase his question diplomatically.
"Li Xijun of the Qingdu Li Family. I am a humble cultivator from Moongaze Lake," Li Xijun replied warmly.
Bi Chengjuan's surprise was evident as he nodded in acknowledgment and said, "Ah, the Li Family... I saw the surprisingly clear aura in your eyes and thought you hailed from a certain Dao lineage in Wu State."
Li Xijun humbly downplayed the compliment and Bi Chengjuan continued politely, "Have you traveled far to visit us? What brings you here?"
"I've heard that the Hengzhu Immortal Dao possesses the Tranquil Purification Technique, which can eliminate inner demons and resolve mental burdens. I have an elder who is plagued by his own inner demons, so I've come to seek a cure," Li Xijun replied earnestly,
Bi Chengjuan was clearly experienced and was not surprised by such a request.
"I have no issue with helping out another fellow Daoist, but I must clarify one point first…"
He paused before continuing in a serious tone, "The Tranquil Purification Technique is not a superior immortal method; it's only a Grade Five cultivation technique and might not be effective for some inner demons. If you seek a cure, you must prepare for that possibility, fellow Daoist!"
"Of course, I understand that some limitations exist," Li Xijun replied matter-of-factly.
Bi Chengjuan nodded, then apologized for being blunt as he went on to explain, "Over the years, people who were not cured by the spell have blamed the disciples who performed it. Some even blamed the Hengzhu Dao… Our Dao has faced criticism over the years so we have no choice but to exercise extra caution."
Seeing Bi Chengjuan's demeanor, Li Xijun felt more positive about him.
This Hengzhu Dao is quite different from Azure Pond; it surpasses all the other gates in the northern part of Yue State… That's truly rare!
After clearing the air, Bi Chengjuan warmed up a lot more, smiling as he asked, "This is your first time visiting Hengzhu Dao, right?"
"That's correct," Li Xijun replied.
Bi Chengjuan explained, "The Hengzhu Dao has a long history. Over generations, we have been known simply as Hengzhu Dao. However, some busybodies later began categorizing various institutions into sects and gates, which led people to refer to us as Hengzhu Dao Gate. This term gradually became widespread, making it difficult to change."
He looked somewhat frustrated as he continued, "The Daoists from the north all refer to us as a Dao Sect. In truth, it is not so. My Hengzhu Dao cannot be compared to Azure Pond or Golden Feather. Although we all follow the Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao, Hengzhu Dao follows the path of ancient cultivation!"
