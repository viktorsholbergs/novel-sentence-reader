Li Xuanfeng returned to the mountain to discuss with Li Tongya and the others about the custom-made dharma artifact. After half a year of cultivation, someone came knocking at his stone door.
Li Xuanfeng stepped outside to see that the snow on the mountain had melted, and the greenery was vibrant under the scorching sun. Excited, he rode the wind along the Guli Road toward the prefecture.
Landing in the market, he strutted into Chu Minglian's shop, where the Embryonic Breathing Realm shop assistant greeted him with the same warm smile.
He offered him tea and asked him to wait for a moment while he fetched Chu Minglian.
Chu Minglian—ever so energetic—approached and was accompanied by the sound of clanging metal. He laughed as he saw him.
"Young Brother Xuanfeng, you've come to pick up your bow, haven't you?"
"Exactly!" Li Xuanfeng responded with a grin, noticing two Embryonic Breathing Realm apprentices carrying a long, thick, dark golden bow that shimmered as they entered the front of the shop.
They were gasping for breath and sweating profusely as they placed the bow on a stone table, a loud thud resounding.
Chu Minglian quickly stabilized the table, causing a white light to emit from the jade surface to dissipate the force and prevent the table from collapsing.
"Be careful!" he scolded the apprentices with a frown.
The apprentices bowed their heads apologetically. Chu Minglian then turned back to Li Xuanfeng, his face breaking into a smile as he introduced his proud creation.
"This bow is made from Golden Barrier Stone and strung with ebony metal essence, forged in mystic flame for exactly one hundred and twenty-six days. What's more, the bow frame is fully inscribed with runes for gathering and condensing qi!"
Chu Minglian proudly continued with his extravagant introduction, "The bow is seven chi and six cun long, with horns measuring two chi and five cun. The Golden Barrier Stone is dark gold… radiant throughout! Its quality is considered superior among dharma artifacts of Qi Cultivation Realm, although it is extremely heavy and difficult to draw."
"Splendid!" Li Xuanfeng praised, his eyes sparkling as he grasped the dark golden bow with one hand, holding the bow with his right and pulling the string with his left.
Gritting his teeth and widening his eyes, his robust blood qi surged as he laughed fiercely and yelled, "Draw—!"
The dark golden bow tensed instantly, drawn full. The buzzing sound filled the air, leaving the two apprentices watching in shock, their jaws dropping as they crouched in pain from the piercing noise.
Chu Minglian stepped back, astonished.
How is this possible..?! Is this man transformed from a demon beast?! How can he possess such strength? I thought this bow was so heavy that an ordinary person could only draw it a fraction of its capacity… Who knew Li Xuanfeng could fully draw it in one go?!
Seeing the items in the room vibrating, Chu Minglian rushed forward, braving the sharp qi to plead, "Fellow Daoist! Many items in my shop are extremely fragile…If you release the bowstring here, I fear many will shatter!"
Hearing this, Li Xuanfeng, feeling his relatively empty storage pouch on the verge of becoming even lighter, quickly eased the tension on the bowstring.
He apologized hastily, "I was too excited! My apologies... and thank you for the reminder."
"Have you thought of a name for this bow?" Chu Minglian asked with a smile.
Li Xuanfeng nodded and pondered for a moment before answering, "Let's call it the Golden Age."
Chu Minglian laughed heartily, proudly gesturing to the bow once more. "Are you satisfied with the bow?" he asked with a grin.
"Extremely satisfied! Brother Chu, your craftsmanship is exceptional!"
Thus, Li Xuanfeng, now beaming with joy, slung the bow over his shoulder and went with Chu Minglian to the market to dissolve their contract and spiritual oath, signifying that the transaction was complete. He then rode the wind out of the market, eager to get home.
After flying for a while, he landed in the Sun Rite Profound Light Formation on the mountain, only to hear a crack under his feet as the Golden Age longbow accidentally shattered a stone tile.
With an awkward smile, he adjusted the bow and walked into the yard.
Li Tongya was demonstrating sword techniques to Li Xuanling, their swords dancing in the courtyard while Li Yuanxiu watched intently from a stone bench. It was a warm sight to see.
Seeing Li Xuanfeng, Li Tongya smiled gently and sheathed his sword.
"You've brought back the bow?"
"Haha."
Li Xuanfeng laughed heartily and grinned, holding the dark golden longbow proudly. He approached and thoroughly explained it to them.
He then, with Li Xuanxuan who was drawing talismans with a helpless expression, insisted on finding a place to test the bow's power with the three of them.
Thus, the four found a clearing in the mountains. Li Xuanfeng took a stance, drew the bow, and concentrated his energy.
The Golden Age longbow instantly lit up with bright golden runes while the bowstring emitted a strong glow, forming a dazzling true essence arrow on the string.
"Fire!"
The distant woods instantly roared and the ground shook violently while a thick plume of dust rose, knocking down five or six large trees and leaving a large crater in the ground. The force was so great that it sent dirt flying everywhere.
A pale golden qi also emanated, forcing the surrounding trees to shed their leaves, creating a rustling sound as green leaves covered the ground.
The three onlookers were momentarily speechless.
Li Xuanling looked at the deep pit on the ground and murmured, "With such power, even a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm might suffer if they were caught off guard..."
Li Xuanfeng, lost in thought, shook his head before finally speaking, "I haven't been able to fully synchronize with this bow; it was merely the power of my true essence and mana force..."
He cupped his fist to Li Tongya, and his tone became serious—solemn, even.
"I plan to go into seclusion for five years to consolidate what I've learned… innovate, and in the process, become attuned to this dharma artifact. As you advised, I will also write a manual on archery techniques."
"Very well," Li Tongya said as he nodded in approval and lifted his sword.
As Li Xuanfeng cupped his fist to his two brothers, he rode the wind thoughtfully toward his cave dwelling on Mount Meiche.
Li Tongya and the others walked up the mountain where Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling praised Li Xuanfeng's actions.
Li Tongya said with a smile, "Among the generations of Xuan and Jing, Xuanfeng possesses the most exceptional talent… You two must not slack off! Xuanxuan, you're nearly thirty yet still at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Our family's techniques surpass others by far; do not let this advantage go to waste."
Pausing briefly, Li Tongya added, "Xuanling has impressively condensed the Jade Capital Chakra at the age of seventeen. In the next decade, both of you should aim to advance to the Qi Cultivation Realm to add two formidable forces to our family."
The younger members promptly acknowledged the advice. As they continued walking, a clan soldier approached them, looking rather anxious and on edge.
"Lord Chen Donghe seeks an audience with you, Clan Uncle!"
"Me..?" Li Tongya paused, and both Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling were momentarily taken aback.
Realization then dawned upon Li Tongya as he laughed and said, "That's good news, we were just discussing bolstering our family's strength... and here comes Donghe!"
Chen Donghe had waited outside the courtyard for quite some time before someone came to invite him in.
Li Tongya was enjoying tea at the head of the table, with Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling smiling at him.
"I, Chen Donghe, have reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and came to seek guidance," Chen Donghe announced, his tone respectful and sincere.
Li Tongya nodded with a smile and sipped his tea, asking softly, "How old are you this year, Donghe?"
"I am twenty-eight this year," Chen Donghe answered.
"Good!" Li Tongya commended, then turned to the others with a smile.
"If Yu Mufeng had reached Qi Cultivation Realm at thirty and the Yu Family praised his talent, Donghe is certainly not falling short!"
"I am merely diligent in my practice... I'm far from Xuanfeng's caliber," Chen Donghe humbly deflected.
But to this, Li Tongya immediately quelled his concerns with affirmation.
"I'll allow you to know this—the few Grade Three Qi Cultivation techniques the Li Family possesses are all legitimate. Having watched you grow up and with Xiangping treating you as his own, we naturally won't withhold them from you."
"Currently, there are two techniques available for gathering qi. The first is the River One Qi Technique, and the other is the Cave Spring Clear Spirit Technique."
After detailing the techniques' advantages and drawbacks, Li Tongya asked, "Which one would you like to have?"
"I'll leave it to the elder to decide!" Chen Donghe replied, as respectful as ever.
Li Tongya smiled softly and nodded, saying, "The River One Qi Technique it is! I have some River Pure Qi here; start by consuming it for your cultivation. Once you've achieved Qi Cultivation Realm, collect a portion of River Pure Qi from the river and return it to the clan to balance the accounts."
"Thank you, elder!" Chen Donghe expressed gratefully.
