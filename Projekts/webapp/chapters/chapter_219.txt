Moongaze Lake, once home to the illustrious Moonlight Origin Mansion hundreds of years ago, now boasted fertile land and abundant spiritual qi.
The southern shore was close to the imposing Mount Dali, which was now teeming with spirit herbs and demon beasts. The western shore was close to the desert, characterized by loose geological formations and abundant resources, including various spirit mines. The northern shore abounded in spirit veins and towering peaks, while the eastern shore—inhabited by the Yu Family, presented a flat, fertile expanse.
Li Tongya embarked on his journey by traversing the Lake of the Moon, heading toward the north shore. Covering several hundred li on foot, the journey would take a day and a night of relentless paddling for those in a mere rowing boat.
Along the way, he passed through areas where aquatic demons lurked, who briefly probed Li Tongya's presence before receding back into the depths.
Unconcerned by these demons, Li Tongya paid them no heed. He had no intention of engaging with them knowing their cunning and treacherous nature, especially in water where they reigned free.
Without reliable informants like the demon fox in this region, he harbored concerns that stronger ancestors might lurk behind those he might encounter. The potential risks far outweighed any possible gains. With this in mind, he pressed onward, endeavoring to avoid entanglement in further trouble.
Midway through his journey, Li Tongya passed by the ruins of the lakeside market on the island, located at the heart of the lake. The once bustling market now lay desolate, its remnants picked clean by scavengers.
The large boats that once traversed the waters had long ceased operations, leaving behind only the remnants of a forbidden formation atop the ruins that were still glowing faintly.
As Li Qinghong observed in silence, the north shore gradually came into view. She found herself captivated by the spectacle of clear lake water crashing against rugged cliffs, and she marveled at the sound of waterfalls cascading from stone caves into the lake.
As she gazed upon the landscape, Li Qinghong remarked softly, "The terrain of the northern shore is notably elevated. It's cold here! There are broken cliffs, stone walls, snowy peaks, and frigid pools everywhere. It's a stark contrast to the endless reeds near our home… Each shore has its own unique charm. While the climate of the southern shore may be more pleasant, it's the northern shore that holds the magnificence of mountains, rivers, and spirit veins, ideal for cultivation."
Li Tongya nodded in agreement as he continued flying northward. As the terrain grew steeper, a towering peak eventually emerged. It was shrouded in thick clouds and mist, covered with pines and cypresses. A translucent formation enveloped the summit, making it seem like an otherworldly paradise.
Amidst the mountain structures, faint silhouettes could be faintly discerned from a distance; some in meditative postures while others sparred with spears and swords.
On the snow that blanketed the mountaintop, a quaint, elegant pavilion stood in the middle.
Li Tongya gracefully ascended and approached the formation. With a gentle touch and a surge of mana, he announced his presence.
"Rogue Cultivator Wan has arrived… please reveal yourself, Senior."
Several figures immediately appeared in the air, probing Li Tongya with their spiritual senses.
Since Li Tongya's gray robe was made of spirit cloth, he was impervious to their prying scrutiny. After a brief moment, a streak of light approached and descended before Li Tongya.
It turned out to be a middle-aged man who was clad in a white brocade robe, his demeanor elegant and refined.
It was none other than Fei Wangbai.
"This is hardly the right place for discussion. Please… come inside, Brother Wan," Fei Wangbai invited, addressing Li Tongya as Brother Wan with familiarity.
Li Tongya nodded before bringing Li Qinghong to the small pavilion atop the mountain with him. They entered the building with Fei Wangbai, then settled into their seats and were served tea.
"Condolences, Brother Tongya…" Fei Wangbai sighed.
Li Tongya was slightly taken aback but quickly understood what Fei Wangbai was referring to. Yet, he opted not to dwell further on the matter and gestured toward Li Qinghong instead.
"This girl is the one I've told you about before, Senior."
Fei Wangbai observed Li Qinghong for a few moments, noting her keen demeanor.
He then requested her to show him her palms. Observing the worn calluses that covered them, he nodded in approval and assured, "Don't worry, Brother Tongya! I'll personally train her."
The matter had been discussed and agreed upon beforehand. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Fei Wangbai was inclined to accept Li Qinghong as his disciple, as long as the girl was not a slacker.
With just a nod from Li Tongya, Li Qinghong kneeled respectfully right away and addressed Fei Wangbai as "Master".
Fei Wangbai nodded and acknowledged her greetings.
I'm satisfied as long as she's a sensible student… I don't expect her to excel or master any great skills. At least she's easy on the eyes, he thought to himself as he observed Li Qinghong.
Fei Wangbai placed importance on appearances. The disciples within the Fei Family were all prim and proper, so Fei Wangbai was relieved about Li Qinghong's refined demeanor.
With a gentle tone, he instructed, "You may leave us now. I wish to have a private conversation with your grandfather."
"Understood."
Li Qinghong stepped down obediently with a respectful bow of her head after noticing Li Tongya's nod of approval, then swiftly exited the inner hall.
Admiring the serene sight of white snow drifting under the dark night sky, a soft smile played on her lips as she moved forward, gracefully opening the courtyard door.
"WHOAA!"
As Li Qinghong opened the courtyard door, a person fell forward with a shocked yelp. Fortunately, Li Qinghong had swift reflexes, given she was now an immortal cultivator who had attained the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm.
She deftly sidestepped, narrowly avoiding a collision with the mystery boy. A lavishly dressed boy slammed right onto the ground and was now grimacing in pain from the fall.
"Who are you?" Li Qinghong asked in amusement as she extended a hand to help the boy up.
In the prime of her youthful vigor, Li Qinghong's voice exuded a lively energy, a stark contrast to her gentle countenance. The boy blushed shyly as he struggled to stutter out his name.
"F-Fei... Tongxiao."
Li Tongya smiled as he watched Fei Wangbai set down his teacup and shake his head in embarrassment.
"That child…" he muttered under his breath.
"That's normal behavior for a teenage boy… don't worry about it."
Li Tongya easily downplayed the situation to diffuse the awkwardness.
Fei Wangbai nodded in agreement, his expression turning serious as he resumed their conversation, "So, Brother Tongya, are you confident in securing the support of more than two Foundational Establishment Realm cultivators after establishing your Dao foundation?"
"Yes," Li Tongya nodded gently, exuding an air of confidence as he replied, "My younger brother has arranged for someone to deliver an Essence Gathering Pill to me. With its help, it's worth a try."
Fei Wangbai let out a soft sigh upon hearing this and lamented, "We lack the immortal secrets passed down through generations, unlike disciples of renowned sects. The journey to Foundation Establishing Realm has always been a precarious one… a gamble with one's life."
"My grandfather perished at that stage, and so did my father. Among the three generations of the Fei family, ten had attempted Foundation Establishment Realm, but I was the only one who succeeded," he continued with a sigh.
The gravity of their discussion weighed heavily upon the atmosphere, prompting Fei Wangbai to shake himself out of it and clench his teeth in determination.
"Very well! I'll place my trust in you, Brother Li Tongya!" he declared resolutely, lifting his teacup in a toast.
"I'm willing to buy you time for three years and make sure that the Yu Family's hands are tied and unable to target your family during this period… And in five years, they will be too exhausted to pose any threat, including Yu Mugao," Fei Wangbai carried on, his voice brimming with conviction.
Seeing Li Tongya's nod, Fei Wangbai continued, "But it is imperative that you succeed, Brother Tongya… These eight years will be bought with many sacrifices and covert maneuvers on my part. Should you fail to build your Dao foundation and perish…"
Fei Wangbai let out a soft sigh and finished glumly, "Then the lake will really be taken over by the Yu Family, with every other family destroyed over the next hundred years… all for the sake of Yu Mugao's deadly ambition!"
Li Tongya nodded, fully grasping the gravity of their situation. If he failed to build his Dao foundation, the Li Family's threat to the Yu Family would diminish significantly. This also meant that the Li Family would be vulnerable, and the repercussions could be dire. They could potentially be erased, especially when Li Chejing's death would finally be exposed.
Li Tongya soared over the lake until the brilliant morning sun cast its glow upon the vast reeds of the southern shore. Finally arriving at his destination, he paused, gazing at the scene before him. Emotions surged within him.
"A gamble with one's life…" he murmured, his gaze fixed on the small island nestled amidst the reeds.
He descended on the shore, watching the craggy rocks basking in the golden hues of dawn in a daze.
He remembered leading Xiangping through these very reeds, stripping his clothes on this muddy shore, and preparing to swim to the island while Xiangping crouched among the reeds, clutching the mirror close to his chest.
He was a robust youth in those days, standing tall in the fading light of twilight, shouting instructions at his younger brother.
"Master! Where are you headed?"
A voice interrupted his daydream.
Li Tongya raised his head slowly, his gaze meeting that of an old man rowing a small boat on the calm lake. Wrapped in a straw raincoat, with a weathered face and a long bamboo pole in hand, the man smiled warmly at him.
"Are you headed to Lichuankou, Master?" he asked Li Tongya, his eyes bright and twinkling.
