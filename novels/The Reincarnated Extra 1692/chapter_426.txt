The Day Before the Decisive Battle
* * *
The day after the Red and Blue Kobudai meeting.
An excellent Red Kobu scout, following Clan Chief Kobdalian’s instructions, went to the valley… the forbidden grounds behind the Black Kobu Tribe village.
And what he saw there, in that place where the fog is far denser than its surroundings… was indeed an excavation site.
A large number of Black Kobu were digging a large hole there, in that place sandwiched between high cliffs, repeatedly carrying soil in their mouths and returning.
There were also some Black Kobu seemingly swimming around aimlessly, but those were probably wind controllers, stirring the air and dispersing the fog to improve visibility.
What was visible beneath the excavated soil was something jagged, like a rugged rock.
The surface of that roughly triangular object was wrapped in cloth and ropes with clearly visible magical power… as if to seal its power.
And although the details were hard to see because of the thick fog, there was a hole at the tip of the triangle… and from that hole, fog was being intermittently and forcefully released.
(It’s creating fog… just like in the myth…!)
From the overwhelming sense of pressure, even though it’s probably sealed, and the characteristic of “constantly emitting fog”, the Red Kobu scout was convinced that this thing the Black Kobu Tribe was excavating was the Calamity, “Humidafai, the Fog Bringer”.
So, the Red Kobu scout, forcing his trembling body to move, hurriedly swam back to the village and reported to Clan Chief Kobdalian and the others.
That ‘The Blue Kobu Tribe’s claims are true. The Black Kobu Tribe is trying to destroy the world’.
Upon receiving the report, Kobdalian officially gave the order.
To attack the Black Kobu Tribe.
The day of the battle was set for three days later.
* * *
And then, a little time passed, and it became the day before the battle.
On this day, Kobdaroze, having finished all his preparations, went to a plateau near the Red Kobu Tribe village.
This is the place where he used to play with his little sister when he was young.
Looking down from the plateau, a wind would blow, clearing the blue fog, revealing the scenery for a short time.
Spreading out there is a flatland with large boulders scattered around.
In other words, that’s the Red Kobu Tribe village.
<<<Hey… What are you doing, Kobdaroze? >>>
At that moment, a voice suddenly called out to him from behind.
Turning around, he saw a Kobudai with a giant body.
The young Clan Chief, Kobdalian.
<<<Nothing… I was just looking at the village.>>>
<<<I see.>>>
Kobdalian slowly swam to Kobdaroze’s side, and they stopped, side by side.
And the two of them silently gazed at the village.
Although the village is now covered in fog again, if they wait patiently, sometimes the fog will clear, like before.
Waiting for that.
When they were young, after playing until they were exhausted, these two would often rest like this.
<<<Have you… finished your preparations? >>>
<<<Of course. What about you? You’re the Clan Chief, you know? You should be busy.>>>
<<<I can do whatever I want, I’m on break. Besides, I’m the Clan Chief. If anyone complains, I’ll beat them up!>>>
<<<My, my, what a tyrannical Clan Chief…>>>
The two of them exchanged idle chatter.
Just like they did when they were young.
<<<You…>>>
And then, here.
Kobdaroze paused and stared at Kobdalian.
<<<You’ve… grown so big…>>>
He then said that.
It’s just a fact.
His giant body.
His magnificent hump.
His strong jaw.
There’s no one in the Red Kobu Tribe who doesn’t acknowledge Kobdalian as a warrior, and as the Clan Chief.
<<<What’s with you, suddenly?>>>
<<<I…>>>
Kobdaroze looked down at the village again.
A sudden gust of wind blew, clearing the fog and revealing the village.
<<<I’ve always thought that I had to protect you. Because I was… your ‘Onee-chan’.>>>
An image of Kobdalian when he was still a young girl appeared in Kobdaroze’s mind.
Kobdalian back then, although mischievous, had a small body.
He was often bullied by the slightly older children, who called him “cheeky”.
And Kobdaroze was the one who protected him, risking his own safety.
<<<And yet, what’s with you? Why are you bigger than me, your ‘Onee-chan’!? It’s not fair!>>>
<<<It can’t be helped… My father was also big.>>>
Kobdalian chuckled wryly at the unreasonable complaint.
And then, glancing at Kobdaroze’s expression from the corner of his eye… he closed his mouth.
Because there was a deep anguish in his eyes.
<<<What… what am I…? >>>
<<<You’re a warrior.>>>
Kobdalian asserted that, as if to cover up the quietly muttered words.
But Kobdaroze weakly shook his head.
<<<I… I’m scared of fighting. Ever since we were attacked by ‘that thing’ last time…>>>
“That thing” refers to the bipedal monster that intruded during their last battle with the Black Kobu Tribe.
They’ve already shared information about that monster with the Blue Kobu Tribe, and are investigating it while preparing for the battle with the Black Kobu Tribe, but its true identity remains unknown.
It’s one of the uncertain factors in this battle.
<<<You’ve become a fine Clan Chief. And yet, I…>>>
Kobdaroze said that, clenching his teeth.
He was frustrated by his own incompetence.
A sound of grinding teeth echoed through the silent world of fog.
<<<…>>>
Kobdalian…
…Stood silently beside Kobdaroze, his eyes closed.
But…
…Finally, making up his mind…
<<<I’m… scared too…>>>
…He muttered.
<<<Eh…>>>
<<<Honestly, I’m scared too. I’m scared of fighting. I’m scared of the Calamity. I’m even scared of that bipedal monster you mentioned.>>>
Kobdaroze was surprised, staring at Kobdalian’s face.
It was the first time he had heard Kobdalian express weakness.
<<<But I’m the Clan Chief. I’m the strongest warrior in the village. I can’t show everyone that I’m scared. So… I’m just acting. Acting like a strong and reliable Kobudai.>>>
<<<Kobdalian…>>>
The wind stopped.
The blue fog immediately flowed in, enveloping the two.
Now, only Kobdaroze could see Kobdalian… the strong, young Clan Chief… his giant body trembling.
<<<…>>>
A moment of silence passed.
Kobdaroze let out a deep sigh.
And then…
WHAP!!
He slapped Kobdalian’s body with his tail, hard enough to make a loud sound!
<<<O-Ow…!?>>>
<<<Ahahahaha!>>>
Kobdalian, caught off guard and without any 【Body Strengthening】, writhed in pain from the sudden attack.
Seeing that, Kobdaroze burst into laughter…
<<<Geez, you’re so hopeless, Kobdalian!>>>
…He said.
And then, with a refreshed expression, as if he had finally come to terms with something…
<<<But it’s okay. Even if you’re really a coward…>>>
He looked straight into Kobdalian’s eyes…
<<<I… your ‘Onee-chan’… will protect you!>>>
He raised his hump high, puffed out his chest, and proudly declared that!
It was at that moment.
The wind blew again, clearing away the surrounding fog.
And then, very rarely… sunlight poured down on the Red Kobu Tribe village at the bottom of the Eserem Sea of Fog!
<<<Ha, hahaha… hahahahaha!>>>
<<<Ufufufufu!>>>
Bathed in the warm sunlight, the two Kobudai laughed uncontrollably.
They laughed and laughed.
As if they had returned to their childhood days as fry.
<<<‘Onee-chan’? Kobdaroze, you’re male now!>>>
<<<Shut up!>>>
And they bantered, nudging each other.
A very belated explanation, but Kobudai are creatures that transition from female to male.
A great battle… that will determine the future of the Flying Kobudai clan…
…The day before, but…
…A very peaceful time was flowing here.
