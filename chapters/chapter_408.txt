The Immortal Official's inquiry into today's events will certainly extend to the cultivation method and other secret techniques of the Azure Pond. He might even uncover aspects only accessible to those of the Purple Mansion Realm… Once Chi Buzi ventures to Moongaze Lake, I'll connect to his soul and extract his memories.
Surveying the area around Moongaze Lake with his divine sense, Lu Jiangxian sifted through the family treasuries. While there was nothing new, the Ding Family had a new set of legacies that included a Grade Two cultivation method of little significance.
Nevertheless, Lu Jiangxian noted down the cultivation technique before leisurely returning to the mirror. Chi Buzi's blood beads were still rolling on the ground.
These could be useful…
Although the beads contained only a modest amount of Chi Buzi's divine abilities, the shamanic path excelled in harnessing dharma blood. The abundant quantity was more than sufficient for Lu Jiangxian's purposes.
Just a bit more persuasion is needed for the Li Family to surrender them to me…
Aside from divine sense and the Supreme Yin Moonlight, the mirror's ability to interact with the outside world was limited. Unless someone triggered the mirror's fate, it was impossible for it to move, let alone pull someone into the realm within it.
Lu Jiangxian, though desiring the blood beads, had to wait for the Li Family to offer them to him.
Li Yuanjiao and the others watched Chi Buzi ride the wind and disappear into the distance, exchanging surprised glances.
"An official from the Dangjiang Creek Water Mansion? An Immortal Mansion?"
"It must be the reincarnation of some metallic essence…" speculated another.
The Li Family was more knowledgeable now.
Li Yuanping nodded in agreement.
"Brother is right, but considering what we've seen at home, how could it manifest a metallic essence…?"
They stopped abruptly, exchanging knowing looks with each other before swiftly changing the subject.
"The one possessing the Daoist Master's body seems reasonable enough, but who knows what he might do next."
Li Xuanxuan, noticeably more relaxed, wiped the sweat from his brow and added softly, "I'm also unsure if this Daoist Master will regain consciousness and seek revenge. We must prepare for all possibilities…"
Turning to Li Yuanjiao, he asked, "What do you think about relocating overseas?"
Li Yuanjiao shook his head slowly and replied, "We would need at least two family members at the Foundation Establishment Realm to consider establishing a branch overseas. Currently, sending anyone would be futile—they'd merely be marching to their demise."
He paused, then proposed, "Why don't we discreetly send Ximing to the Xiao Family to consult with Ancestor Yuansi? We could have Ximing fostered under his tutelage in the guise of practicing alchemy."
Li Yuanjiao gradually regained his composure and continued elaborating, "Ancestor Yuansi is a warm and generous elder. Under his guidance, Ximing will surely thrive, learning much more than he would at home."
"Moreover, should disaster befall the Li Family and we face annihilation, the Purple Mansion would surely attempt to erase us. Without divine abilities, fleeing would be futile. Xiao Chuting, who has sheltered Chen Taojing, a suspected remnant of the immortal sect, will likely use his divine abilities to conceal Ximing's whereabouts as well, ensuring our family's legacy endures," he added.
Li Xuanxuan sighed as he sat down.
"Ancestor Yuansi has already done much for our family… The debt of gratitude we owe is immense, and I would not involve him further unless absolutely necessary."
Li Yuanping, who had been listening quietly, nodded slightly, then cupped his fist and excused himself.
"I will make the necessary arrangements."
Li Xuanxuan gave him a nod, then turned back to Li Yuanjiao.
"In these perilous times, perhaps you should take the mirror, seal the ancestral hall, and retreat to Mount Wutu for safety."
Li Yuanjiao performed a hand seal, then carefully collected the red beads from the ground and placed them in a jade box. Once done, he picked up one and examined it in the moonlight.
The bead's radiant red hue, shadowed by a faint gray mist, shone particularly brightly. Staring at it for an extended period stirred a deep-seated sense of unease and irritability within him, feelings that were difficult to put into words.
As soon as he secured the beads, Li Yuanjiao felt the talisman seed within him stir and was immediately delighted.
Oh, they can be used as an offering in the sacrificial ritual..? I knew these were good stuff!
"This is a serious matter. We must consult the mirror," he replied to Li Xuanxuan.
With that, he activated the complex formation, entered the ancestral hall, and pushed open the heavy stone door. He kneeled and bowed deeply before the mirror.
"I, Li Yuanjiao, the disciple of the Li Family that is beset by calamity and faces great peril, respectfully request the Profound Light to protect and preserve… I pray for your supreme guidance…"
After completing the ritual and offering deep bows, the mirror's light gradually dimmed before descending before him, indicating his prayer's success.
Li Yuanjiao had studied several books of prayers from the mirror, dedicating himself to understanding these mystical incantations. He often wondered why the mirror required such elaborate rituals, assuming it was a reflection of its exceedingly high status.
However, his recent encounter with a metallic essence claiming that he was the Immortal Official from the Dangjiang Creek Water Mansion governed by the Immortal Lord, had left him deeply unsettled. Piecing together all he knew about the mirror, a startling possibility emerged.
Perhaps this mirror serves a vast immortal mansion in a realm beyond our skies! Maybe it is merely a medium for communicating with this distant celestial realm…
If this were truly the case, then everything made sense! Perhaps Chi Buzi had inadvertently met a specific criterion—maybe an offense against the Immortal Mansion or he was destined to become a physical sacrifice, thus allowing an Immortal Official to descend to the mortal realm!
With these thoughts unraveling in his mind, the potential of mighty forces behind the scenes slowly became apparent. Li Yuanjiao dared not speak of his suspicions aloud but held them close in his heart.
Feeling a surge of excitement, he wondered, Does expressing our gratitude to Supreme Yin meant… we'll be able to reach the immortal mansion as long as our cultivation is high enough…?
Suppressing his wild speculations, Li Yuanjiao carefully stored the mirror and exited the backyard. He nodded to his father and announced respectfully, "I'm going to Mount Wutu to cultivate!"
Li Xuanxuan exhaled deeply, nodding in return as he watched his son leave. He then proceeded to close up the formations, ensuring all traces were concealed within the secret chamber before leaving to meditate as well.
As soon as Li Yuanjiao returned to Wutu Peak, he was greeted warmly by Xiao Guiluan.
"How was it?"
Li Yuanjiao shook his head and replied, "Nothing to worry about, it was just a false alarm."
He quickly changed the subject.
"The family plans to send Ximing to the Xiao Family to study alchemy… I'll need you to make the journey as well."
"Understood," Xiao Guiluan responded succinctly, taking to the winds without further question.
Li Yuanjiao felt a pang of guilt and unease in his heart. Xiao Guiluan trusted him completely, yet he had to keep secrets from her.
After all, having experienced it firsthand and hearing it from Li Tongya, the talisman seed could indeed protect against the Purple Mansion Realm Cultivator's deceptions. Only those who received the seed could lie directly to Purple Mansion Realm cultivators without fear of detection.
Xiao Guiluan did not have such protection from a talisman seed, and knowing too much would probably only endanger her.
"Hm?" Li Yuanjiao paused, a sudden thought striking him.
The Yu Family has been too quiet!
Compelled to investigate, he took out the bluish-gray mirror and soared northeast, over mountains and forests, before landing at the Yu Family's cave dwelling.
The highest cave, richest in spiritual qi, was heavily fortified by a grand formation. The entrance was also sealed tightly with multiple layers of spirit formations.
Inside, Li Yuanjiao found the cave floor littered with shiny jade fragments that were still rolling around. Blue, green, red… They scattered across the ground, reflecting off one another. The cave was also filled with various crystals from ceiling to floor, and the ground was blanketed with fine white salt.
A skeleton, colored like jade but broken in half, lay collapsed. The upper section of the skeleton had fallen to the ground, cleanly severed, the cut so smooth and flat it seemed almost polished.
