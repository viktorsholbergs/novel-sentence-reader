The Lotus Temple, located in the Zhao State, was the legacy of a Dharma Master. The Zhao State revered Buddhism, with numerous temples, and among the 461 temples, the Lotus Temple ranked in the top ten. It had annexed a vast amount of land and supported over ten thousand monks.
Minghui rode the wind, flying over the expansive farmlands at the foot of the mountain. The emaciated tenants below dropped their farming tools hastily and bowed fervently.
"Blessings be upon you, Master Monk… Blessings be upon you!"
Minghui acted as if he had not heard them and descended toward the grand golden hall on the mountain. The magnificent hall was filled with countless golden candles and incense, with smoke billowing like a white waterfall flowing softly from the gaps in the steps and windows. This very hall consumed an astonishing amount of oil and wood every year, a feat that only such a large temple could possibly afford.
At the end of the hall were several naked women. Some were seated, some were kneeling, and some were even lying down. Luxurious garments were scattered all around on the floor. Among them was a small child who looked to be about five or six years old.
The child appeared charming and delicate and was suckling milk from a woman's breast. Around them, teenage girls bustled about, carrying oil jugs and refilling the lamps hurriedly.
The air was thick with the scent of oil and incense. Minghui quickly bowed and greeted respectfully, "Minghui greets Master! May Master be blessed with a hundred lifetimes of joy and compassion, achieve an indestructible body, and become a true immortal!"
The child, who was suckling milk, cast a sidelong glance at him and spoke in a gentle and pleasant voice that echoed through the hall. The teenage girls on either side kneeled down as he said, "Minghui, didn't I send you to escort Lord Murong? Why have you returned so soon?"
"Innocent, I am innocent!" Minghui exclaimed as immediately he kneeled and bowed deeply, knocking his forehead to the ground repeatedly as he explained the whole story.
The child opened his eyes as he released the nipple he had been suckling from, his mouth still full of milk residue as he cursed fiercely, "Useless fool… Whenever trouble arises, you run back here. Present the golden palace at once!"
Minghui quickly summoned the golden palace. Floating out from his sleeve, it was initially palm-sized but soon expanded to the stature of an average person. It looked like a small table, though it was shaky and full of cracks.
The child examined it for a while, his expression somewhat peculiar. After a while, he spoke once more in his childish voice, saying, "How strange, its inherent rank is very high, yet lacks any ferocious aura... It must belong to some unfamiliar immortal Daoist."
This child was naturally Minghui's master, Maha Jinlian, the ancestor of the Lotus Sect. He had been cultivating as a Maha for three hundred years and has already reincarnated seven times, with profound mastery of Buddhist doctrines. He was only a step away from becoming a Dharma Master. In the Zhao State, he was one of the strongest figures.
Buddhism cultivation differed greatly from immortal cultivation. The immortal cultivation began with the Profound Scenery Chakra, and upon condensing it, one could perform immortal arts.
In contrast, Buddhist monks spanned the realms of Embryonic Breathing and Qi Cultivation as mere mortals with iron-like bodies. Upon breaking through to become a Master Monk, they slightly surpassed Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators of the immortal Dao. However, when they became a Merciful One, they were slightly weaker than a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator. A Maha was weaker than a Golden Core Realm cultivator, but slightly stronger than the Purple Mansion Realm, creating a sense of asymmetrical power.
Seeing the colorful light in the hall, Maha Jinlian felt a profound and subtle spiritual energy and was overjoyed.
Despite being a mere Master Monk, Minghui actually glimpsed at a Golden Core Realm cultivator and survived… Could it be that this Golden Core Realm immortal cultivator is on the verge of death? I, having cultivated through seven lifetimes as a Maha, am only a step away from becoming a Dharma Master. It seems my destiny has arrived! Hahahaha!
Maha Jinlian, having cultivated seven lifetimes as a Maha, was already comparable to a cultivator at the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm. His desires surged and he made up his mind, speaking bluntly, "Even if it is a Golden Core Realm cultivator, so what? Though I may not be able to defeat them, dissolving one of their threads of fate should be no problem. Present that artifact!"
He calculated his moves carefully. The Golden Core Realm cultivator's condition was abnormal, and merely peeking at it shouldn't cause any issues. With the backing of a Dharma Master, he felt confident.
Minghui was overjoyed upon hearing this and presented the golden palace as Maha Jinlian performed hand seals and closed his eyes slowly. The child's face was full of contempt as the colorful light within the golden palace gradually dimmed and transferred into his hands.
After several dozen breaths, the contempt on the Maha's face slowly faded, and he began to perform more hand seals seriously. Minghui waited for a long time, but there was no sound from above.
He peeked carefully and saw Maha Jinlian covered in sweat, muttering incessantly. Minghui was terrified and he immediately kneeled, praying in his heart.
This is not my fault... This is not my fault... You great cultivators can fight amongst yourselves, but please spare my life… Please spare my life!
Minghui remained silent with his head lowered, while Maha Jinlian began to tremble. The colorful light within the golden palace had completely disappeared, the hand seals in his hands glowing with a crystalline light.
Before his eyes were endless darkness, his mana flowing uncontrollably into his hands and his aura weakening in waves, until finally… there was a flash of light.
"This is..."
Beneath the drifting dark clouds, the land lay in darkness. Lu Jiangxian sat feeling somewhat troubled beside a stone table, holding a shimmering golden light in his hand.
"I have seen those unafraid of death, but never anyone so eager to rush toward it..." Lu Jiangxian muttered to himself, as he had been aware of Minghui spying on him earlier.
Although he failed to probe into this mirror, Minghui had used his fate thread to draw himself into this predicament. If it had been when Lu Jiangxian had just awakened, he might not have been able to deal with him. Now, however, after decades of cultivating shamanic and immortal arts, Lu Jiangxian had utilized the mirror's inherent rank to keep Minghui firmly in grasp.
"I was afraid of inviting trouble and spared your life, yet you continue to provoke me..."
Lu Jiangxian's current Supreme Yin Profound Light had only the power of the peak Foundation Establishment Realm, but its inherent rank was likely frighteningly high. As long as he did not reveal the mirror, no one could calculate it. As for those who relied on talisman qi for their calculations, he could easily reverse the backlash upon them.
But… Maha Jinlian probably has someone even more powerful backing him. If I kill this fellow and attract the attention of a Dharma Master or a Revered One, it will be troublesome indeed!
He frowned, and an idea struck him. With a tap on the desk, he conjured an endless hall made of white jade, intricately engraved with complex incantations. It was the same hall from Li Jiangqun's memories, the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Lu Jiangxian sat high above, looking down.
"With my current power, I can pull this guy's spirit into the mirror for the duration of one incense stick. I might as well use this opportunity to gather some information and then cut off this strand of spirit, making him forget everything.
After some consideration, Lu Jiangxian made up his mind, grasped the golden light, and threw it before him. Instantly, moonlight was condensed, which transformed into a five or six-year-old child. He looked well-behaved and cute and was draped in a robe, kneeling on the white jade floor of the hall.
"Who are you..?" Maha Jinlian asked as he opened his eyes groggily, glancing around. He immediately sensed that something was terribly wrong. He quickly tried to activate his power but found his body empty, devoid of mana, and was instantly terrified.
Looking up again, he saw a man sitting high above him, his face radiating with a blinding light that hurt his eyes, his attire exuding an immortal aura. Maha Jinlian shrank back, lowering his head in fear.
This...! To capture me with just a fate thread, this is no mere Golden Core Realm immortal cultivator! This is a true immortal... Damn it, how could there still be an immortal lingering in the world? Damn Minghui… for making me provoke such an old monster!
Despite his thoughts, Maha Jinlian dared not be neglectful. He pleaded mournfully, "This humble monk is a Maha who cultivates the Great Compassion and Joyous Lotus Manifestation. I did not know an immortal was present… Please, Immortal, show mercy and spare my life..."
