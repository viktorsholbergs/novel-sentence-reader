The group exited the secret chamber, with Li Xuanfeng clad in his black-gold armor leading the way. He took his seat at the head of the room while the others stood respectfully to the sides. Sitting upright, he asked, "Have you gained any insights?"
Everyone nodded in affirmation. Moments earlier, a ripple of energy had triggered revelations through their talisman seeds, causing their sea of qi to brighten. The seeds emitted a more luminous hue, and several chants appeared in their minds. Through their talisman seeds, they could sense the immortal mirror in the Great Void and use the chants to establish a connection.
Seeing their nods, Li Xuanfeng paused briefly before stating gravely, "This is good news. Xizhi should also sense this within the sect."
The group nodded again, though their subdued expressions reflected the lingering atmosphere of mourning. The recent loss in their family prevented much celebration. After a moment of thought, Li Xuanfeng added, "Although Yu Muxian is now dead, refrain from acting rashly around the lake for the time being. Once I return to the southern border and understand the sect's internal negotiations through the Ning Family, I will send back instructions. Proceed accordingly."
Li Qinghong nodded in agreement and replied, "We will await your message. However, there is one matter… In the past, the Yu Family had a swordsman by the name of Yu Mujian."
Few in the hall recognized the name, though Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly. Li Qinghong turned to explain to the younger members, "During the Yu Family's peak, its brothers each excelled in their own right. Yu Muxian was extraordinarily gifted, Yu Mugao was ruthlessly cunning, and another, Yu Mujian, was defeated by our grandfather. Afterward, he went north seeking the Dao and has been unheard of since."
After a brief pause, Li Qinghong continued gravely, "If this individual is still alive, he may have already surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm. Caution is advised."
Li Xicheng, who managed family affairs in the mountain foot, immediately understood and responded, "Over the years, Second Uncle and Youngest Uncle planted informants within the Yu Family to foment discord. I will investigate whether there is any correspondence or trace of his whereabouts."
Li Xuanfeng nodded, satisfied with their diligence, and dismissed everyone except Li Qinghong.
He asked, "I have heard that in recent years, relations with the Fei Family have grown distant. Is it because Fei Qingyi is cultivating on Yuanwu Peak?"
Li Qinghong nodded and briefly explained the situation, speaking softly. "Indeed… The Fei Family has not communicated with us for years. Whatever debt they owed us appears long forgotten."
Years ago, Fei Yihe, the young master of the Fei Family, had accompanied Li Xuanfeng to the southern border. Li Xuanfeng still carried letters from Fei Yihe addressed to his family. Hearing Li Qinghong's words, he furrowed his brow and said gravely, "I will pay the Fei Family a visit."
Li Qinghong hesitated, then added with concern, "I… I will go with you."
Li Xuanfeng did not object. The two took to the skies, leaving the mountain's protective formation behind as they flew north. They soon passed over an island filled with ruins and scattered formations.
"The marketplace on the central lake island from back then," Li Xuanfeng remarked, glancing down. The area had been scavenged by countless rogue cultivators over the years, though the restrictive formations still activated sporadically. He added, "In another decade or so, a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators and a formation master should be enough to clear the remnants. The island's wealth could easily support cultivators."
Li Qinghong nodded; the family had long planned to reclaim this land. Together, they continued northward. The northern shore of Moongaze Lake rose higher, with abundant spirit veins and breathtaking landscapes. Cliffs, stone walls, and snowy peaks emerged into view as Li Xuanfeng and Li Qinghong descended toward Glacial Cloud Peak.
As they landed, a middle-aged man in white robes approached them, radiating cold qi. His brows lifted as he looked at them, his heart racing.
The woman before him stood atop lightning, her cultivation at mid-Foundation Establishment Realm. With her willow-like brows and almond-shaped eyes, she appeared to be around twenty-eight or twenty-nine. Her presence exuded a strange familiarity.
Seeing the woman whose presence already far exceeded that of a typical Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and the man clad in black-gold armor, whose mere presence caused eye-watering discomfort with his blade-like features, the middle-aged cultivator quickly concluded, They are disciples of an immortal sect.
At once, he bowed low, his posture bending to its utmost, and respectfully addressed them with his head lowered, "This is the Glacial Cloud Fei Family. I wonder, who are the honored seniors before me?"
Li Xuanfeng did not respond, but Li Qinghong, ever polite, answered warmly, "Qingdu's Li Qinghong."
The moment she spoke, the man before them appeared as if struck by lightning. His face turned pale, his lips trembled, and for a moment, he was at a loss for words. After hesitating for a breath, he finally stammered, "So it is… it is the Li Family. I am Fei Tongcai, and I greet the two honored seniors."
Only then did Fei Tongcai realize why the woman had seemed familiar. Years ago, Li Qinghong had spent three years with the Fei Family, and he had seen her a few times. Now understanding the situation, he took a deep breath and bowed his head again, asking cautiously, "May I ask what brings the two seniors here?"
Finally, Li Xuanfeng spoke, his tone low and unhurried, "Our families were old acquaintances. Have we now come to the point where even entry to Glacial Cloud Peak is denied?"
Fei Tongcai was drenched in sweat, unsure of how to respond. Bowing even further, he replied, "This junior holds little authority… the family head himself must come to greet you."
He hurriedly excused himself, leaving Li Qinghong to quietly explain, "The Fei Family was once forbidden to practice the Patterned Brocade technique, completely dismantling their system of cultivation over the centuries. They have had to start anew, and for decades now, they have not produced a single Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator."
Li Xuanfeng, standing with his hands behind his back, replied calmly, "Mortals will always seek profit and avoid harm. The Fei Family's choices cannot be considered wrong, but whenever I think of how Second Uncle spared their entire clan with a single sword strike, only to receive this in return, it leaves a bitter taste."
Before Li Qinghong could respond, her expression shifted. Below them, Glacial Cloud Peak suddenly erupted with radiant light. The Fei Family's long-relied-upon Cloud Gathering Southern Heaven Formation activated, blanketing the entire immortal peak in a shimmering white glow.
Li Xuanfeng raised an eyebrow, watching as a figure flew toward them. The man bore a striking resemblance to Fei Yihe, sharing seven-tenths of his features and a similarly handsome demeanor. However, his current expression was grim. Riding the wind, he lowered his voice as he greeted them, "I am Fei Tongyu, head of the Fei Family. Greetings to the honored seniors."
The activation of the formation made the Fei Family's distrust blatantly clear, a slight of no small magnitude given that Li Tongya had once saved their entire clan. And yet, Fei Tongyu personally came to greet them, placing himself at risk. The contradiction in these actions—the defensive formation and the risky gesture—made Li Qinghong shake her head internally.
My elder brother once said this man was like a weasel rushing to prepare for winter. Indeed, his actions are telling. He is cautious to the extreme, yet even his offense is clumsy and incomplete—a man who sways with the wind.
Li Xuanfeng studied Fei Tongyu closely, a faint and ambiguous smile appearing on his face. In a deep voice, he declared, "So, you are Fei Tongyu! Excellent!"
From his sleeve, he pulled out a letter and handed it over with an impassive expression, "This is from your father. Do as you see fit with it."
With a flick of his hand, he tossed the letter along with a storage pouch, which hit Fei Tongyu squarely in the chest with a sharp thud. Without another word, Li Xuanfeng turned and soared away. Li Qinghong, seamlessly playing along, hurried forward and chided, "Fellow Daoist! How could you act so rudely? This is excessive!"
For Fei Tongyu, it was as though a bolt of thunder had struck his ears. Hearing news of his father for the first time in decades left him reeling, his composure shattered. Already rattled by the intimidating presence of Li Xuanfeng's piercing gaze, he was utterly disoriented and stammered helplessly, "I… this… ah!"
Li Xuanfeng's decisive gesture had delivered their message clearly, returning the slight with precision. Meanwhile, Li Qinghong softened the blow, her tone gentle as she admonished, "Fellow Daoist, your behavior truly leaves much to be desired."
Fei Tongyu stood dazed in midair for a long moment, his movements slow and clumsy. Clutching the letter written by his father, tears welled up in his eyes. In a tone of quiet pleading, he finally said, "I was only afraid… never mind. Please, honored seniors, I humbly invite you to visit our peak."
Li Qinghong knew that Li Xuanfeng had not gone far. She gave a slight nod and descended with him. Fei Tongyu hurriedly offered to escort her into the cave dwelling, but Li Qinghong had no intention of staying long. She merely said, "Let us walk around this peak instead."
