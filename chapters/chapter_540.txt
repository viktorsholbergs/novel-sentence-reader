Lijing Town, Xu Family.
Xu Xiao stood topless, exposing his muscular shoulders and arms to the morning air. He had taken a walk early this morning and noticed several things that left him uneasy. It felt like a few silver needles were pricking at the space between his eyebrows.
Hiding in the house, he clutched a jade pearl in his sleeve and sat cross-legged, pretending to be calm. However, his breath wavered, and his thoughts flickered with uncertainty.
This morning, Captain Chen has not patrolled the streets as usual… Either something has happened, or he has been transferred. If the Li Family intends to make a significant move, they won't be able to hide it from him, so they'll move him away first...
Though Xu Xiao had both Old Man Liu and Captain Chen in his grasp, he still lacked confidence. Deep down, he felt a constant unease surging within him. Liu Lingzhen's weak character was a concern; he had to put up a facade in front of her.
Though he looked down on them, he was acutely aware of the Li Family's deep roots. Keeping these two under his control increased the risk of exposure, amplifying his anxiety.
After going out to buy medicinal herbs, he passed by the tavern to check if Old Liu was drinking as usual, only to find the shop vandalized and closed.
He returned to the courtyard with doubt gnawing at him. A bad feeling welled up in his heart.
If the Li Family were truly plotting against me, they wouldn't send just anyone to do it... But why would they go to such lengths? Who would act so obviously then so discreetly...?
He felt strange about this whole thing and was constantly on the edge. The urge to flee surged within him, but he hesitated; Liu Lingzhen was still on the mountain, and he could not bear to leave her behind.
Xu Xiao fantasized about returning home gloriously after a decade, overthrowing the Li Family's tyrannical rule, and elevating his own family to a prestigious clan. However, that was still far off, and for now, he could not afford to fall out with the Li Family.
As the jade pearl spun in his palm, many fantasies flashed before his eyes. Pain shot through his chest and shoulder blades. His heart raced as if an impending disaster awaited him. His left hand instinctively pressed against his storage pouch.
Hiss!
Suddenly, he felt a chill over half his face. Reacting quickly, he summoned the wind, retreating just in time. A flash of red armor materialized around him as the wall behind him crumbled, revealing a sinister black light.
BOOM!
A deafening explosion rang out and dust filled the air as the building collapsed. A massive black snake tail swept through the rubble, narrowly missing Xu Xiao and leaving him pale and shaken.
"A Foundation Establishment Realm demonic creature?!" he gasped in shock.
Before him stood a malevolent-looking youth, his black robe billowing in the wind. Between his black boots on the ground, two black hooks writhed in the shadows, exuding a bone-chilling aura.
Xu Xiao, taken aback and filled with dread, exclaimed, "You're that Hooked Serpent!"
Li Wushao was taken aback by the fact that Xu Xiao managed to dodge his attack, but he quickly suppressed his surprise.
"How strange. To think that a mere Qi Cultivator like you managed to dodge my attack," he murmured.
Battle cries filled the air, and several figures swung their swords, intent on cutting down Xu Xiao.
Reacting swiftly, Xu Xiao crushed the jade pearl in his grasp, conjuring a round Qi shield that enveloped him. He met Li Wushao's gaze with a solemn expression and declared, "I have never offended you. I merely intervened to stop that young master of yours from forcefully taking a commoner girl for a bride… Yet, here you are, trying to silence me!"
His words belied a blatant disdain for the Li Family's Qi Cultivators as he frowned and questioned their intentions. The Qi Cultivators surrounding him were inconsequential.
It's just a group of small fries that can't hurt me… They practice Grade Two or Three cultivation techniques and know no spells.
Since Xu Xiao's Qi shield was of the Foundation Establishment Realm, the attacks from the Qi Cultivators were ineffective against it. The mana lights merely bounced off and dissipated into the air.
Li Xijun observed the entire scene quietly, hidden among the clouds in the distance.
Thank goodness Li Wushao is here. Otherwise, even if all the Qi Cultivation elders of our family were present, they couldn't hope to touch him… It's fortunate that Li Wushao stayed behind instead of Kongheng, and he's repaired his tail hooks. If there were any missteps, he wouldn't stand a chance against him today!
Li Wushao, a demonic creature from the Eastern Sea, did not understand what Xu Xiao meant by forcefully taking a commoner girl for a bride and dismissed his words as mere nonsense. Ignoring him completely, he continued to extend his tail hooks.
Chen Mufeng, determined to stop Xu Xiao from saying more, shouted, "Devil! You killed Liu Yi! You've used devil techniques to control hundreds of households! You've advanced from the second stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm to the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm in just two years! What else could it be if not devil cultivation techniques? Who knows how many lives you've consumed in secret!"
While he was speaking, Li Wushao's tail hooks collided with Xu Xiao's shield. The difference in strength between Foundation Establishment and Qi Cultivation Realms was staggering.
Xu Xiao had no time to dodge and was struck by the tail hooks. Although the shield absorbed most of the impact, he still spat out a mouthful of blood and crashed into a section of the gate wall.
Li Wushao's survival in the Eastern Sea relied on the tail hooks on his tail and a few powerful techniques that utilized them. Unfortunately, he had once been ensnared by Kong Tingyun's dharma artifact and was defeated. Now, with his tail hooks repaired, his formidable performance excited Li Xijun.
Xu Xiao… He doesn't seem to be that strong…
Just a single strike from Li Wushao was enough to make Xu Xiao spit blood and stagger backward. Li Xijun breathed a sigh of relief. While keeping a watchful eye on the unfolding situation, he carefully observed the changing expressions of those around him.
Yes… Even if he were the reincarnation of a Golden Core Realm cultivator, only a peak Qi Cultivator could withstand an incense stick of time against a Foundation Establishment Realm ancestor from the Kong Family... I must have been too cautious.
Li Xijun stood in the clouds, blaming himself. He looked at the Foundation Establishment Realm shield protecting Xu Xiao, then fished out a talisman and sent it flying downward without hesitation.
The talisman flew through the air, transforming into an exquisite little hammer adorned with golden patterns. Its ends curved upward like sheep horns as it crashed down toward Xu Xiao with a resounding bang.
Li Wushao remained focused. Two shadows darted across the ground, moving swiftly like venomous snakes. As the two spells of the Foundation Establishment Realm collided, they struck with precision from both the front and back.
The little hammer talisman Li Xijun used was purchased from the Yuan Family. It was of exceptional quality—intended as a life-saving talisman that he had planned to only use in desperate situations.
The little hammer flew through the air and collided loudly with Xu Xiao's shield. To Li Xijun's dismay, the light of the shield merely dimmed as it withstood the attack.
What a powerful talisman!
With fierce determination, Li Wushao coordinated his attack according to the powerful strike of the Foundation Establishment Realm talisman. Initially planning to whittle away the strength of his opponent, he changed his battle strategy and struck hard from both directions.
"Devil cultivator?! You fools! This is the Profound Flame Merging Fire Secret Technique from the immortal sect!" Xu Xiao shouted, momentarily taken aback by the accusation.
He wanted to retort more but was quickly silenced by the decisiveness of Li Xijun, who had unleashed a high-quality Foundation Establishment Realm talisman right off the bat.
In his hand, a black and red token materialized. Upon activating it, a burst of red light was quickly unleashed. This was an attempt to block Li Wushao's tail hooks, hoping it would buy enough time for his shield to recover.
However, the red light only managed to block the black tail hooks momentarily. Xu Xiao's mana was drained rapidly, at the speed of a whale sucking up water.
Facing a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator like Li Wushao, a mere Qi Cultivator like Xu Xiao stood no chance. Despite his mana being considerably more than most cultivators, he faltered within moments.
Li Wushao was taken aback, thinking to himself, So, it is indeed the Merging Fire secret technique from Crimson Reef Island... How did it spread all the way here? If I kill this man, will it cause trouble for my master?
Gradually, Li Wushao increased his strength, and Xu Xiao found himself in a perilous predicament, screaming internally. The pressure from a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was unbearable. Without the shield, he knew he would not last more than a few exchanges against Li Wushao.
Desperation took hold, and he resorted to his most powerful attack. Biting his tongue, he sprayed a mouthful of blood onto the token.
As he cast the spell, the red light faded, and the shield creaked under the immense strain. Xu Xiao spat with venomous hatred, "Isn't your family worried about being punished by the Azure Pond Immortal Sect for taking human lives this way here?"
Li Xijun was momentarily stunned by his words. He gave the man a bewildered look.
Who could possibly rival the Azure Pond Sect when it comes to taking human life? Is this man truly clueless or is he feigning ignorance with such naive statements? The Azure Pond Sect would be delighted even if my family made buns with human flesh. They would even ask for a few…
Yet, as Li Xijun contemplated this, a sense of certainty washed over him.
This person doesn't seem to be a reincarnate but rather one who has inherited a legacy due to his fate…
In an instant, the token flared to life, unleashing a grayish-red flame that surged up and down, swirling like mist. Li Wushao's pupils dilated in alarm, and his tail hooks recoiled like a frightened bird, though they were still grazed by the flame.
Roar!!!
Li Wushao's head swelled like a balloon, twisting and morphing until it transformed into a snake head the size of a house, supported only by his small human form. His eyes, as large as a window, blazed a furious red as he screamed in agony, unable to maintain his human guise due to the pain.
His tail hooks retreated beneath his robe. A corner of them was scorched and blood was dripping from the injuries.
Seeing that the flame was effective, Xu Xiao's spirits instantly lifted. He let out a triumphant laugh, riding the wind as a red ring appeared beneath his feet, lifting him into the air.
