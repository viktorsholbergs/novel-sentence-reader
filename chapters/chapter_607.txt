In the cloud sea, after an initial clash, each side had already gained some insight into their opponent's artifacts. There was no need for further concealment. Xiao Yongling revealed himself, chasing after the sword artifact and grasping it in his hand, silently moving closer.
Meanwhile, Tu Longjian moved with eerie stealth, somehow managing to get within three chi of Yu Muxian without being noticed. Wielding his golden hammer, he swung it ferociously toward Yu Muxian.
Yu Muxian tilted his shoulder slightly and shifted to a new hand gesture. Using his pinky's upper joint to represent You, its middle joint Xu, and its lower joint Hai, he formed a lotus-flower seal. Golden light flickered in his eyes as he seated himself midair.
Splash…
In an instant, a golden lotus bloomed in the sky, its layers of petals enclosing Yu Muxian within. He did not counterattack but instead maintained a steady defense, intending to hold out until Tang Shedu arrived to assist.
These three successive spells demonstrated his extraordinary talent. Not only could he wield numerous techniques with ease, but his ability to quickly discern the flow of spiritual energy and adjust his methods accordingly highlighted a combination of innate aptitude and rigorous training. This far outstripped the capabilities of those around him.
The Li Family cultivators lacked deep foundations, Xiao Yongling was a half-trained scion of a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, and Tu Longjian seemed incapable of invoking techniques to disrupt spiritual energy, leaving Yu Muxian free to manipulate it as he pleased.
However, Xiao Yongling was renowned as the Man on Mount Feather, he was no easy opponent to deal with. His sword flicked upward, tracing an elegant arc in the air, and his immortal foundation, Eastern Feather Mountain, surged to its full potential within him. As his lips parted, he exhaled a wisp of white mist.
The white mist scattered in the air, drilling downward with force, spinning and twirling. It froze the surrounding spiritual energy, gradually forming a vague outline of a massive mountain. Suspended mid-air, the mountain neither rose nor fell, standing still as if suppressing the spiritual energy around it.
However, the sword in his hand repeatedly slashed through the lotus-like petals before him, slicing through more than a dozen layers, but each strike felt as if it lacked substance. Even the sword seemed on the verge of being trapped. Xiao Yongling, not particularly adept in swordsmanship, hurriedly withdrew the blade.
Meanwhile, Tu Longjian's golden hammer had already reached him. Its gray flames exuded terrifying power, forcing Yu Muxian to use his six golden shields to block the flames. Even as the enemy advanced right to his face, Yu Muxian dared not recall the shields. Instead, he brought his two fingers together and pressed them toward the golden hammer.
At first glance, this action seemed suicidal, but Tu Longjian raised an eyebrow slightly, only to witness the golden hammer forcibly stopped in mid-air by Yu Muxian's maneuver. Tu Longjian's expression showed surprise as both his hands lit up.
Yu Muxian quickly withdrew his fingers, finding himself momentarily overwhelmed. The six golden shields retreated further and further, while the gray flames edged closer. Still, he hesitated to summon his spirit artifacts, thinking, If I release the two Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts now... they'll undoubtedly scare these people away. At most, I might injure one of them… That would be far too reckless.
Yu Muxian was determined not to leave any loose ends for himself. Since he had chosen to act, these two Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts must ensure that all of his foes were annihilated without exception.
Yu Muxian continued, Tu Longjian still carries one of the six jade boxes from the hall. Killing him now is just perfect!
Indeed, in the midst of this exchange, Tang Shedu had already erupted in fury. Abandoning the battle with Miao Ye, he turned back in a rage, his gaze cold and domineering as he roared, "Who dares harm my junior brother?!"
On the other side, Miao Ye, as though granted a pardon, knew full well that this chaotic battle was beyond his ability to meddle in. He had no intention of getting involved. Finally seizing a rare chance to escape, he wasted no time in abandoning the battlefield and fleeing at once.
Although Miao Ye harbored resentment toward Tang Shedu, he was shrewd and cautious, Given the current situation, even if those trying to harm Yu Muxian win, they'll likely silence me to tie up loose ends. And if they lose, I'd still die in the end. As for profiting from their battle—who doesn't have a hidden trump card? It's never that simple!
Making his decision swiftly, he fled into the distance. Tang Shedu, now free of his previous engagement, unleashed his halberd, its momentum overwhelming and exuding the aura of someone who had long been in the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm.
The earlier battle had already demonstrated to Tu Longjian and his allies that Tang Shedu's strength was astonishing. They all felt a sense of foreboding. Yu Muxian, however, smiled faintly, just about to speak when a buzzing sound suddenly rang in his ears.
"Hmm? Again?" Yu Muxian sneered. The spell above his head, Heavenly Golden Cymbal, rotated and floated in mid-air. He blinked a few times, then froze, Can't locate it? How is that possible?
From the moment of the ambush, Yu Muxian had meticulously maintained control over the battlefield, analyzing the logic of each move and assessing everyone's strength and intentions. But now, this unexpected development left him genuinely baffled.
The Heavenly Golden Cymbal was designed to detect incoming spells and artifacts, employing incredibly sophisticated techniques to avoid the stealth methods or concealed artifacts of his foes. Thus, it was impossible for Li Xuanfeng to be using any sort of concealment technique.
If he could attack from this far, why would he have stayed within detection range earlier and wasted his advantage? A flurry of thoughts flashed through Yu Muxian's mind, but he couldn't pinpoint where the attack was coming from. With Tang Shedu's halberd only a single step away and the buzzing sound in his ears growing louder, Yu Muxian felt a surge of unease.
A sense of danger welled up within him. Blood formed on the tip of his tongue, its metallic tang spreading in his mouth. Acting decisively, Yu Muxian made his move, "No more hiding!!"
He opened his mouth, spitting out a golden ring no thicker than a pinky finger but as large as a human head. The ring was inscribed with countless intricate runes. It hovered briefly, then began to rise into the sky.
"Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact—Binding Ring!" Yu Muxian shouted.
As soon as the golden ring appeared, the buzzing sound in Yu Muxian's ears vanished. Without any visible movement or golden rays striking out, a Profound Patterned Spirit Arrow appeared trapped within the ring.
The arrow seemed almost alive, struggling incessantly within the confines of the golden ring. It emitted the sharp clinking sounds of metal clashing, but despite its efforts, the disparity in power was insurmountable. The arrow could only whirl helplessly within the ring.
Seeing this artifact in action, the faces of everyone present changed. Tu Longjian narrowed his eyes slightly, thinking to himself, The first Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact is out—and it's a defensive artifact? This is going to be troublesome.
His spiritual sense flickered as he inwardly cursed at the token in his possession, You call yourself an ancient spirit artifact? Look at that modern spirit artifact—how formidable! If you continue to underperform, and something happens to my allies... how do you plan to handle it?!
Expressions shifted among the crowd, but Tang Shedu let out a breath of relief. He understood better than anyone how Daoist Master Yuanwu regarded this junior disciple of his. If Yu Muxian were harmed here, Tang Shedu would likely face severe consequences.
Yu Muxian, always calculating, had not discussed the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts with Tang Shedu on their way here. Tang Shedu was therefore pleasantly surprised, feeling a wave of cruel delight as he redirected his halberd toward Xiao Yongling.
Xiao Yongling glanced coldly at the golden ring. He recognized it immediately—it was clearly modeled after a certain artifact from years ago. He didn't have time to examine it closely, as he was forced to withdraw his sword and turn to defend himself. Hidden in his sleeve, his fingers clenched tightly around a jade hook.
Before their artifacts clashed, Tang Shedu's mocking voice rang out, "You are from the Xiao Family, hah! I bet you are quite familiar with the appearance of the Binding Ring, are you not? What are you called again? Man on Mount Feather or something... looks like you are destined to become the next Xiao Xianyou!"
