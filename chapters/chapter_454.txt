Within the world of the mirror…
While Li Yuanjiao journeyed through the desolate mountain temples to Shanji Prefecture, Lu Jiangxian had read 131 manuals on Embryonic Breathing Realm techniques, 36 on Qi Cultivation Realm, and two on Foundation Establishment Realm.
All these manuals were piled on the desk in front of Lu Jiangxian, forming a small mountain before him.
Two more Foundation Establishment Realm techniques: Yi Wood Talisman Technique and Mountain Mist and Sea Technique, corresponding to the Dao foundations of Yi Wood Wholeness and Mist Yin Reversion...
The scrolls before Lu Jiangxian had already formed a small hill. He was carefully reading the Yang Nourishing Technique from Tu Longjian, which was the longest secret technique he had come across, truly broadening his horizons.
This is the first time I've encountered someone naturally endowed with fate…
Li Yuanjiao had spared Tu Longjian, largely because Lu Jiangxian had not intervened, allowing Li Yuanjiao to be swayed by his thoughts and let the man go.
Under the illumination of the mirror, Tu Longjian's aura was a bright crimson, his presence incredibly formidable. Though Li Yuanjiao could not see it, Lu Jiangxian observed it clearly.
If Tu Longjian had died at Li Yuanjiao's hands, thus disrupting the flow of fate and the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator traced it backward, it could have caused significant problems...
Lu Jiangxian had his fair share of encounters with many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators. He knew they could not foresee every change in the world, nor could they monitor everyone constantly. However, having mastered the Life Divine Ability and formed alliances, they had a general sense of the forthcoming situation.
Li Yuanjiao was not supposed to discover this person. It was only because fate was no match for the immortal mirror that he did. If he had killed Tu Longjian and taken the Yang Nourishing Technique, it could have potentially ruined important plans of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators.
Though the alliance between the Xiao and Li families might lead the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators to suspect Xiao Chuting, Xiao Chuting would naturally suspect the Li Family. However, Xiao Chuting was already walking on thin ice. Lu Jiangxian feared that the old man would not be able to withstand the pressure, and he also feared that some in the Purple Mansion Realm might directly suspect the Li Family.
But what exactly is this fate thing... it's vastly different from divine abilities, affecting others without leaving a trace!
Lu Jiangxian had watched as the crimson fate behind Tu Longjian swirled, transforming Li Yuanjiao's intent from one of murder to one of recruitment. Even Li Yuanjiao's own aura was later also tinged with crimson, but due to his growing suspicion, he forcibly changed what could have led to his family's ruin into a situation where they merely suffered financial loss to avoid greater disaster.
There's a hint of Flowing Qi Swallowing Spirit here, almost like... two fates compromising with each other... But if Li Yuanjiao also has fate on him, why have I never seen it?
Is fate manipulating people, or are people manipulating fate..?
Li Yuanjiao flew leisurely on a cloud, the mist swirling around him as he traveled. He had recently acquired a new treasure, and he was so enamored with it that he could not bear to part with it. While he was carefully exploring its wonders, he had flown into the territory of the Profound Peak Gate without realizing it.
His mood was light and carefree, and he felt an inexplicable sense of relief, as if he had narrowly escaped disaster. This only strengthened his belief that Tu Longjian was indeed endowed with fate. He halted before the gate's formation and put away his artifact.
A few moments later, Kong Tingyun came out to greet him. She had changed into a set of pale yellow feathered robes, appearing much more formal than when they had last met. She smiled and greeted, "Brother Jiao has arrived! Tingyun has been waiting for quite some time."
Li Yuanjiao returned the gesture with a cupped fist, and Kong Tingyun said, "Fellow Daoist, come with me to Lake Xian; we can talk on the way."
The two of them ascended into the air, and Li Yuanjiao was the first to ask, "How did your faction fare at the sea entrance?"
Kong Tingyun smiled, her eyes curving as she replied, "We had a bountiful harvest for once. In such a major event as the division of the grotto heaven, even the crumbs that fall from Azure Pond's fingers are enough to satisfy us!"
Seeing no unusual expression on her face, Li Yuanjiao nodded, looking ahead at the vast, dark lake that reflected spots of golden light under the blazing sun. Kong Tingyun continued, "I fought with the Hooked Serpent once; it was difficult to deal with. It feared the immortal sect backing me, so it did not dare to go all out and quickly fled a hundred li away to settle in a new location… I was afraid of scaring it away, so I did not pursue it further."
"We should search separately. The Hooked Serpent has a family and is not hard to find. It will only take half a day of searching, but we must be cautious not to alarm this creature," she suggested.
Li Yuanjiao responded, "That won't be necessary."
He shook his head and descended onto the surface of the lake. Instantly, the water began to surge, and the faint movements of a serpent dragon could be seen beneath the waves, occasionally revealing half of its black scaly claws.
Before long, a dark blue crayfish jumped out of the water, curled up in fear, trembling as it was held aloft by the waves. Li Yuanjiao asked in a low voice, "Where is the Hooked Serpent?"
After listening closely, Li Yuanjiao tossed the crayfish back into Lake Xian and said with a smile, "Seventy-two li to the east, there's a desolate mountain in the middle of the lake… The Hooked Serpent is in seclusion there."
"I almost forgot about the abilities of your Boundless Ocean!" Kong Tingyun praised in awe.
The two of them ascended into the air again, and Li Yuanjiao asked, "You mentioned earlier that the Hooked Serpent was driven away by the Azure Water Serpent Dragon… What kind of creature is this Azure Water Serpent Dragon?"
Kong Tingyun replied, "I inquired about it at Crimson Reef Island overseas. The Azure Water Serpent Dragon is not particularly strong, but it was sent by a certain serpent dragon palace under the sea. It has a profound background and drove the Hooked Serpent away…"
Li Yuanjiao, still thinking about the nature of Foundation Establishment Realm creatures in the sea, asked in confusion, "Are there many creatures in the sea like this Hooked Serpent with no significant background?"
Kong Tingyun nodded and answered, "There are countless demonic creatures in the sea, and the Eastern Sea is full of demon dens… Not to mention the Eastern Sea, even Lake Xian has quite a few. The Hooked Serpent is simply the weakest among them."
As they conversed, the desolate mountain soon came into view in the distance. Kong Tingyun performed a hand seal, clouds and mist began to rise beneath their feet.
Li Yuanjiao whispered, "I have an aura restraining artifact."
Kong Tingyun's eyes lit up as she nodded in understanding and replied, "I will go first, and Brother Jiao can follow."
Li Yuanjiao watched as she rode the wind into the water, then activated the Profound Patterned Bottle to scan the surroundings. After ensuring there were no hidden people or creatures lying in ambush, he too descended into the lake.
The waters were already churning, with various fish and shrimp scattering in all directions in a desperate bid to escape.
Li Yuanjiao caught sight of the emerald-green formation plate before him and could not help but feel a twinge of envy as he thought to himself, As expected of the three sects and seven gates; even the formation plates they use are of the Foundation Establishment Realm…
He slowly approached with the formation trembling incessantly.
This woman is unlikely to collude with the demonic creature to kill me... With the mirror in hand, I'm not afraid.
And thus, he used the Profound Patterned Bottle to release a mist, concealing himself as he infiltrated the formation. There, he saw a massive, dirty serpent body, about two zhang thick and as large as a water tank with scales gleaming brightly, each as big as a palm.
The Hooked Serpent's voice trembled as it lamented, "I have cultivated for many years and was fortunate to consume several spirit beasts to achieve my current Dao foundation. I came to Lake Xian only to feed on spirit creatures and had no intention of offending anyone… Could you consider the difficulty of my cultivation and spare my life, my lady? I will leave immediately and never return to Lake Xian!"
Kong Tingyun, knowing that Li Yuanjiao had entered the formation, remained silent and maintained her efforts. Li Yuanjiao quietly advanced. Seeing that it could not persuade her, the Hooked Serpent growled harshly, "How arrogant you are, little girl! Do you think you can kill me with this formation? I might as well eat you and then flee to the depths of the Eastern Sea! Can Changxi really chase me down from thousands of li away to seek revenge?"
As the serpent spoke, Li Yuanjiao moved to within a zhang of the massive snake. Any closer and he might alarm the creature, so he gripped his sword and prepared to strike, waiting for the serpent to raise its head high before unleashing a sword arc.
