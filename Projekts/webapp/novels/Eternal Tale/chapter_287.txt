Two years later. The immortal points had been allocated to their defense.
Deep within the boundary battlefield.
A monstrous creature, a creature spanning five hundred zhang, stood upon the earth. Its aura was overwhelming, more terrifying, and immense than a towering mountain. Just a single glance was enough to extinguish any will to resist.
This creature resembled a spiritual beast, its eyes brimming with intelligence. Behind it loomed a grand black mountain, even taller than the beast itself, a sight enough to send chills down one's spine and cause the soul to tremble.
But today, the creature gazed warily at the massive living warship that stood in opposition to it in the distance. It had no choice but to emerge from its domain.
The colossal river of corrupted blood trailing behind the ship shocked it to its core, filling its eyes with disbelief. This... How many of its kind had been slaughtered?!
The vicinity of the grand black mountain had become a forbidden zone, devoid of any other creatures. Only the echoes of the void's tremors remained.
In the distance, heart-wrenching screams of other creatures rang out, as though they had encountered an unspeakable terror.
“Humans!”
The creature spoke, its voice thunderous as it opened its blood-red maw. The angry, hateful words reverberated across the heavens and earth. “You dare come to this place?!”
Two figures stood on the crane-shaped prow of the giant ship, surprise flickering in their eyes. That the creature could speak was unexpected. As a Nascent Soul-stage creature, it indeed had some merit.
Chen Xun stepped forward, a cold smirk on his lips. “A Nascent Soul creature? We've been searching for you for a long time. Never thought you’d actually exist.”
The colossal creature took a step forward, its appearance fierce and eyes radiating malice. Its entire body was covered in black scales that gleamed like polished obsidian.
Around it, a dense corrupted blood seeped out, boiling as if alive, radiating an overwhelming hatred. From the start, it was a fight to the death, causing the two to furrow their brows.
Even the grand black mountain behind it emitted faint hums, a heavy and oppressive energy permeating the heavens and earth.
“Creature,” a calm voice echoed, utterly unfazed by the creature's aura. “I am curious—how did your kind come to exist? Let us talk. You are no match for me.”
“Arrogant human! Do you dare kill me?!” The Nascent Soul creature’s deep voice rumbled with mocking laughter; its hatred intensified to the extreme. “You’ve slaughtered so many of my kind. How much life do you have left? Lifeforms like you deserve annihilation—you should not exist!”
Chen Xun narrowed his eyes slightly. As expected, it was incorrigibly hostile and unreasonable.
“Moo?” The big black ox looked at Chen Xun, awaiting his command to take action and slay the creature.
Little Red cowered at the stern of the ship, staring at the giant creature with a mix of terror and despair. It had never encountered a being so colossal.
This was the might of the heavens and earth—the power of the Nascent Soul stage. Even from a distance, it evoked a profound sense of helplessness.
“Old Ox, I’ll handle this.”
Chen Xun stepped forward, his tattered straw hat still slung over his back. Though his aura remained subdued, the big black ox felt an unshakable mountain standing before it.
When the elder brother dared to act, it meant no adversary in the world could rival him. That was absolute confidence. The big black ox’s eyes betrayed no worry.
The creature’s gaze narrowed, the power of its corrupted blood surging violently through its body. Crimson light surged as its immense aura skyrocketed.
The grand black mountain behind it seemed fused to its being, transmitting a weighty force throughout its body. The blackened earth beneath its feet cracked under the oppressive pressure.
Nascent Soul cultivators could manipulate the elemental forces of heaven and earth. Yet this creature had harnessed the power of the black mountain within the boundary battlefield!
“Impressive.”
Chen Xun praised lightly, standing opposite the creature, still observing it unhurriedly.
“Arrogant human! You deserve death!”
The Nascent Soul creature roared, its rage boiling over. The power of its corrupted blood coalesced into its fist, and the weight of the black mountain enveloped its body. It swung a massive blow toward Chen Xun, aiming to sever his life force!
Buzz!
The overwhelming crimson light engulfed the sky, cascading forward like an unstoppable tide. The weighty force of the black mountain resonated, causing it to hum as the heavens roared. The creature’s attack was imbued with the terrifying might of the Nascent Soul stage.
Chen Xun’s expression remained impassive, as insignificant as an ant. The surging blood light engulfed him, his reaction seemingly too slow to match the creature’s immense speed.
The gusts howled, and the crimson hue was boundless.
Even the giant ship trembled under the impact’s residual force. The five-element crane tree atop it rustled faintly.
“Brother Xun!”
Little Red shouted, its soul trembling under the oppressive might. Despite its fear, it cried out in desperation, its eyes filled with worry.
“Moo!”
The big black ox exhaled through its nostrils, its eyes wide in shock. This was its first time witnessing a Nascent Soul attack—an unfathomable gap compared to the earlier Golden Core stage.
Heaven and earth fell silent, the stillness eerie.
“You will all perish,” the creature declared coldly, gazing down at the living warship in the distance. “No being can escape the great calamity of immortality.”
Its gaze fell on the big black ox, filled with absolute hatred. Yet, the ox’s eyes remained fearless, brimming with disdain as it locked eyes with the creature.
The creature disliked this.
As it prepared to strike again, its words were cut short by a sudden, cold voice that echoed across the battlefield.
“Impressive for a Nascent Soul creature.”
Shock flashed across the creature’s face as a radiant, white treasure light pierced the bloody sea, cascading like a rain of light. A phantom ten-petaled flower bloomed and hung inverted.
Amidst the radiance, a man stood, his body shrouded in pristine energy, exuding an awe-inspiring presence. The corrupted blood of the creature couldn’t come close to him. Moreover, the earlier devastating attack had left him completely unscathed.
With a deafening roar, the creature retreated a thousand zhang, locking eyes with Chen Xun. Its expression turned grave—it realized something was amiss with this human. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator couldn’t possibly withstand such an attack.
“Die!”
Its face twisted in fury as it raised its arms once more. The grand black mountain behind it fully awakened, emitting ripples of mystical power. The mountain’s immense force flowed continuously into the creature, empowering it further.
Boom!
Before them, the earth crumbled and collapsed at a visible rate; the rumbling sounds were unending as the creature’s power soared to unimaginable heights.
The corrupt beast's ferocious leap split the air, its tainted blood condensing into a near-tangible force. The technique "Severance of Life" was one of the world's most terrifying arts, transcending the rules of heaven and earth. Its massive body, like a towering mountain, bore down on Chen Xun with crushing force.
Chen Xun's eyes gleamed, lightning crackling around him in a radiant storm. Bathed in the electric glow, his silver hair streamed behind him as he charged towards the behemoth like a bolt of lightning.
The corrupt beast froze momentarily, failing to lock onto Chen Xun's position. Panic welled up in its heart. What kind of speed is this?
Suddenly, a small figure appeared before it, causing the beast to roar in fury. It thought this puny creature was rushing to death, daring to confront its strike head-on.
Boom!
A blinding light erupted, accompanied by the cacophony of mana colliding. Bloodlust filled the corrupt beast's eyes as it believed its foe had fallen to its blow.
Yet, a faint, oppressive aura spread from the center of the collision. The beast's heart skipped a beat, its expression twisting in disbelief.
The human was unscathed. Not a single hair was disturbed, not even forced to take a step back.
Chen Xun raised his head slowly, his voice calm, yet cutting. "I just wanted to test my defenses."
As his aura surged, the atmosphere within hundreds of miles froze. The air grew still, and the space before them seemed on the verge of shattering.
The corrupt beast shuddered, rage and fear mingling in its voice. "Human! Dare you slay me? Are you seeking mutual destruction?"
It tried to hide its excitement. If a being of such power fell by its hand, the very meaning of its existence would be fulfilled.
"Old Ox, Little Crane," Chen Xun called out calmly.
"Moo!"
Rustling sounds filled the air.
"Break the mountain!"
"Moo, moo!"
The big black ox bellowed, its eyes solemn. It glanced towards the towering black mountain in the distance, lifting a Five-Element Formation Banner. Elemental energies of the world surged, thickening the oppressive atmosphere.
The tree on the giant ship erupted with divine brilliance, channeling power into the vessel. The intricate patterns engraved upon its hull began to glow as their energies awakened fully.
The tension in the air grew suffocating, filled with an unyielding finality.
Little Red gasped for breath, its eyes wide with shock and reverence. An instinctual urge to bow overwhelmed it.
Humm…
A vast and majestic sound echoed, and the ship accelerated to its limit, transforming into a streak of light. Space itself rippled under the intensity of its passage.
The big black ox stood at the bow, a massive black coffin at its side. Its aura climbed relentlessly, rivaling even Chen Xun's.
Their path led straight toward the towering black mountain, leaving destruction in their wake. None dared to stand in their way.
Even the corrupt beast trembled, its focus consumed by the far more terrifying human before it.
"You... dare come here!" it roared with hatred. "Kill me, and you'll suffer a thousand years of karmic backlash! No living being dares to take such a risk!"
"But you won't live to see it," Chen Xun replied coldly.
Ascending to the sky, lightning and deathly energy coiled around him. In his hand materialized a massive black executioner’s axe, exuding an aura of annihilation.
The corrupt beast snarled, attempting to summon the mountain's power, but its focus broke when the ship unleashed a radiant surge. Boundless energy clashed with the black mountain, shaking the heavens.
Boom!
The mountain quaked as cracks spread across its surface. With a thunderous roar, the big black ox hurled the coffin skyward, smashing it into the mountain with unstoppable force.
"You...!!!"
The corrupt beast's eyes burned crimson with rage, its massive body surging forward.
Slash!
A black streak of light tore through the air, carrying an unstoppable force that cleaved through both beast and earth alike.
The ground split open with an earth-shattering roar, forming an immense gorge shrouded in deathly energy. Neither tainted blood nor natural forces could mend the devastation.
The corrupt beast's gaze dimmed, its disbelief frozen on its face. Why hasn't my life ended? Even the backlash hasn't come...
Its thoughts ceased as its colossal body—five hundred feet long—was severed cleanly in two, its tainted blood raining down.
The black mountain attempted a desperate response, its energies striving to reassemble the beast. But as the mountain faltered under relentless strikes, its power waned, unable to resist the encroaching death energy.
Silence….
The world stood still. The remnants of the beast's titanic corpse lay in the deathly gorge, a grim monument to its defeat.
In the distance, the big black ox bellowed, its roar reverberating across the battlefield. Pillars of blue light erupted from the mountain's base, forming an enormous array.
Boom!
The ancient black mountain, a sentinel for countless ages, collapsed in a deafening crescendo. Waves of icy energy surged outward, reshaping the land.
All corrupt beasts within a thousand miles quivered in terror, their instinct to flee overriding all else.
From the shadows, Little Red trembled uncontrollably, its eyes fixed on the lone figure in the sky.
Hovering amidst the storm, Chen Xun gazed down coldly, his executioner’s axe gleaming with deathly energy. He stood like an eternal monument, unyielding and absolute, in a world that had been forever changed.
