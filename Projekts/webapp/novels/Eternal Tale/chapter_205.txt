Qian Nation, one of the Top Ten Sects, the Danding Sect.
Atop the majestic Yun Peak, the cliffside glimmered for a moment. In an instant, the clouds and mist beneath the mountain forest cleared, revealing lush greenery that enveloped a grand complex of intricately carved pavilions and ancient halls.
The entire mountain range was filled with the rich fragrance of medicinal herbs. Within the sect, a few cultivators had reached the third layer of the Water Spirit Art.
At the peak of a mountain, a few pavilions were constructed. The elders who had been guarding the area had all retreated. A small old man was earnestly trying to persuade a man and a black ox.
"Daoist Chen Xun, please! I'm begging you, let Shen Yifeng go," the old man, looking distressed and disheveled, pleaded, his face full of worry. "The outside world is full of turmoil. How could he know that you two were simply visiting?"
"Daoist Zheng Yi, we came here with local specialties to pay a visit, and you didn't even let us finish speaking?" Chen Xun frowned slightly, his expression darkening. "He insulted my brother right off the bat, and yet I didn't smack him to death with a single palm strike!"
"Moo!" The big black ox spat on the ground in disgust.
The disciples of the Top Ten Sects were indeed arrogant. They had experienced this arrogance firsthand back at Southern Dipper Mountains, where someone had even dared insult their leader.
Zheng Yi felt deeply vexed by Shen Yifeng. He hadn't properly disciplined him, and now, with the chaos in the cultivation world, Shen Yifeng, in his late Golden Core stage, believed himself invincible.
Zheng Yi had encountered many Nascent Soul cultivators across the sects, but he had never seen this man or the big black ox before. Without properly assessing them, Shen Yifeng had arrogantly spoken a few offensive words.
The result? A single strike had left him vomiting blood and retreating, instantly subdued and suppressed beneath the mountain for two months. Every day, Shen Yifeng screamed in agony, claiming he had repented and would no longer look down on others.
By the time Zheng Yi arrived, it was already too late, and he had to graciously invite them into the sect. He managed to keep the incident quiet, as it was too humiliating.
"Daoist Chen Xun, Daoist Black Ox, I will personally take this disciple back and ensure he is strictly disciplined," Zheng Yi said, sighing as he bowed respectfully. "Before their ancestor left for the North he entrusted him to me. It was my failure that led to this."
Zheng Yi had no idea who these two were or what their true strength was. He couldn't even see through their cultivation levels. However, he could faintly sense their Nascent Soul power, enough to make him feel a bit of pressure.
The Danding Sect was currently weak and could not afford to offend two Nascent Soul cultivators, so he had no choice but to reason with them calmly.
"Since Daoist Zheng Yi has personally come to plead, we'll drop the matter," Chen Xun replied with a serene smile.
"You are truly noble, Daoist Chen Xun!" Zheng Yi expressed his gratitude with a bow. "You've shown my sect great kindness."
Chen Xun smiled gently. Zheng Yi had waited until his anger had subsided before coming to plead, which showed a good sense of timing. With a wave of his hand, the Five Elements Chains that bound Shen Yifeng dissipated into the air. Shen Yifeng, eyes brimming with tears of gratitude, was finally free!
After adjusting his robes and taking a few deep breaths, Shen Yifeng rose into the air and ascended the mountain. He was tall, dressed in flowing silken robes, with a solemn expression and dark, somber eyes. There was a faint trace of sorrow between his brows, and his lips were tightly pursed, as if harboring some unspeakable pain. It was indeed caused by the psychological shadow left by the figure before him.
That feeling of powerlessness still lingered, like all his spells had failed him.
"Rebellious disciple, what are you standing there for?!" A stern voice snapped him back to reality.
Trembling, Shen Yifeng hurriedly bowed. "This junior, Shen Yifeng, greets the two seniors. My words were disrespectful that day, and I beg for your forgiveness!"
Chen Xun snorted coldly. Insulting him was one thing, but insulting the big black ox was unacceptableâ€”especially with such baseless rudeness.
"Moo!" The big black ox snorted heavily, its gaze still unfriendly. It didn't mind being insulted, but insulting its big brother was crossing the line.
Zheng Yi's expression shifted as he sensed that something was wrong. He began scolding Shen Yifeng harshly, and as the scolding continued, Shen Yifeng's head hung lower and lower, cold sweat breaking out across his brow. The arrogance he once held had been thoroughly crushed.
Suddenly, a radiant light flickered as Zheng Yi's anger grew. He began to summon a magic artifact, ready to strike.
"Daoist Zheng Yi, wait! He's just a junior. No need to go that far!"
"Hmph, Daoist Chen Xun, I've been too lenient with this disciple. Don't stop me!"
"Moo moo!"
"Alright, alright, no need for that," Chen Xun and the big black ox quickly pulled Zheng Yi back, realizing that he truly intended to make a move.
The scene grew chaotic as Zheng Yi refused to calm down. Chen Xun finally shouted, "Enough!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox bellowed furiously, unleashing the power of the Five Elements, causing the mountain peak to glow brightly.
Boom! Together, Chen Xun and the big black ox suppressed Zheng Yi.
Shen Yifeng was dumbfounded: "..."
Zheng Yi, his beard trembling, was equally stunned: "..."
"Alright, Daoist Zheng Yi, no need to get excited. Take your disciple back. We won't interfere further," Chen Xun said, his tone gentle. He then turned to Shen Yifeng, adding, "The cultivation world is full of hidden dangers, and old monsters lurk everywhere. Be careful with what you say."
"I will remember your advice, Senior!" Shen Yifeng, drenched in sweat, took the words to heart. The truth of the matter was right before him.
Zheng Yi heaved a sigh of relief, grateful that these two were not murderous maniacs. It seemed the situation had been resolved peacefully.
Still, Zheng Yi felt a bit embarrassed. How had his Nascent Soul been so easily suppressed earlier? What kind of technique was that? He had never heard of such a thing...
Feigning composure, Zheng Yi bowed once more. "Daoist Chen Xun, Daoist Black Ox, I will take my rebellious disciple back. We will visit again another day."
"Of course, and thank you for accommodating my brother and me, Daoist Zheng Yi."
"Moo~" The big black ox smiled, developing a favorable opinion of Zheng Yi. Nascent Soul cultivators, after all, were reasonable and knowledgeable.
Zheng Yi smiled in return, grabbing Shen Yifeng before stepping into the air and vanishing from the mountain peak.
Chen Xun and the big black ox resumed their reading outside the pavilion, their chairs swaying gently in rhythm with the breeze.
Chen Xun had now begun studying Nascent Soul-level techniques. And where better to find them than the Top Ten Sects of Qian Nation, known for their deep foundations and ancient traditions?
With the major sects suffering heavy losses during their expedition to the Northern Territory, now was the perfect time to visit, as it would avoid many complications.
Few disciples ventured near the peak, but those who did often speculated about the identities of the mysterious guardians of the pavilion.
Every few months, Zheng Yi would visit, engaging in conversations with Chen Xun about the art of alchemy. The two hit it off, as both were deeply knowledgeable on the subject.
Chen Xun benefited greatly from these discussions, expanding his understanding and deepening his knowledge of alchemy.
