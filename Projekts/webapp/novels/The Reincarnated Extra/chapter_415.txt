【Tales of the Gods 16】 Muwidgi, the Former Wheat God
* * *
<<<GROW… THE WHEEEAT!!!>>>
Muwidgi was enraged!
What second form, what harvest season, don’t be ridiculous!
He’ll uproot and dispose of him and all his followers!
With such fury, Muwidgi unleashed 【Trillion Bread】 again.
Countless giant loaves of bread flew towards the glistening white rice at super speed!
But…!
<<<【Freshly Pounded Mochi Wall】!!>>>
As Mochulchi shouted, a super giant wall of mochi appeared in front of him!
The mochi entangled all the bread missiles, completely nullifying the attack!
This is the power of mochi… the power of MOCHI!
And that’s not all!
<<<I see… Analysis, complete!>>>
Countless silver magic circles unfolded around Mochulchi as he muttered those words!
Could this be!?
<<<【Trillion Bread】ーーー!!>>>
Yes, it’s Muwidgi’s special move, 【Trillion Bread】!
Mochulchi analyzed the information of the bread missiles he absorbed into the mochi, and instantly copied it!
He mastered it… as his own technique!
This is the power of a god’s second form!
<<<MUGIOOOOHーーー!?>>>
PAN!
PAPAN!!
PAPAPAPAPAAN!!!
Wheat bread is delicious, of course, but this is a continuous bombardment of rice flour bread, which has a different kind of deliciousness!
Muwidgi, unable to dodge, was hit by all the shots!
CREAK, CREAK, CREAK!
He recoiled greatly, and an unpleasant sound came from his bending stem!
<<<And now, the finishing blow! Here I come!>>>
Mochulchi, seeing an opportunity, shouted, and extended a flat noodle from his body.
<<<【Pho Whip】!!>>>
And then, he swung the flat noodle around… and slammed it against Muwidgi’s weakened stem with all his might!
ZAAAAN!!
The flat noodle’s speed exceeded the speed of sound, and cleanly… severed Muwidgi’s stem!
<<<WHEEEEEEEEATーーー!!!>>>
With a ‘slurp’ sound…
…The severed upper part of Muwidgi fell to the ground… revealing his vascular bundles.
Muwidgi’s scream echoed through the fields of the Harvest God’s divine realm, and all that was left was… a giant wheat stem, swaying pointlessly… without any leaves or ears.
<<<I won…>>>
Mochulchi, seeing that…
<<<I WOOOON!!!>>>
…Exploded with joy!
Mochulchi, spinning and dancing in the air as if being cooked in a pot, shouted!
<<<Now! The reign of rice begins…!>>>
And he inadvertently… muttered his desire…!
But!
Muwidgi is a plant.
Just because his ears were severed… his life… wasn’t over!
<<<WHEEEEEEEEEEATーーー!!!>>>
The next moment!
Rage, and hatred!
A scream of madness, filled with negative emotions, echoed through the divine realm!
And then, the wheat grains on Muwidgi’s fallen ears… all sprouted at once!
They grew rapidly, entwining themselves around the stem of Muwidgi’s main body, which was still standing even after being severed, like a vine, puffing out his silhouette like a skirt!
<<<W-What is this!?>>>
Leaving Mochulchi, who could only panic and couldn’t react, the situation progressed rapidly!
Muwidgi’s body thickened in an instant, but the transformation wasn’t over yet.
Next, the cut end of Muwidgi’s stem… split vertically in two.
And from that split…
…Oozed…
…A woman’s upper body… emerged…
<<<Mu… mugi… wheat…>>>
TL Note: ‘Mugi’ also means wheat.
Muttering painfully, the woman slowly raised her upper body.
Her form was gigantic, befitting Muwidgi’s stem… and boasted a breathtaking beauty.
Her upper body was clad in a strange and seductive, revealing dress, seemingly woven from wheat stalks and leaves, and her skin was as white as flour.
Her alluring eyes, with a sharp, slanted shape, were golden… and her hair, flowing from her head, was also golden.
But that hair… isn’t just hair.
It’s ears of wheat.
From her head, abundant, ripe ears of wheat are growing!
From afar, she looked like a goddess.
But she’s not just beautiful.
The wheat grains growing on her head…
Each and every one of them… has a human face… suffering and struggling… attached to it.
Furthermore, emanating from her entire body was a sinister resentment.
Anger, suffering.
Resentment for wheat being nothing more than food.
A mad desire to rule the entire world.
They spread out as dark purple haze, emitting a terrible stench, polluting the surroundings…
…The rice, and even the wheat, that touched the haze, developed strange spots on their leaves, and withered.
<<<Wheat, wheat… Grow the wheat… and then…>>>
The woman who appeared on Muwidgi’s upper body…
…No…
…Muwidgi, in his new form, grinned wickedly.
<<<Offer them to me… everything!!>>>
…He declared!
<<<Y-You! Youーーー!! That’s, that’s unfair!? Taking such a humanoid form that humans would find popular in your second form… No, that’s not it!!>>>
Mochulchi, seeing Muwidgi’s transformed state, shouted!
<<<You, you used almost all of Shuhavekmeg-sama’s remaining divine energy!? If you do that, Shuhavekmeg-sama will…!>>>
<<<Hohoho… I care not what happens to the former Harvest God? After all, now… I am here.>>>
Saying that, Muwidgi cast a cold gaze at the rice grain floating in the air…
…And then, pointed his palm towards it.
<<<Begone.>>>
He was about to unleash a curse… that could wither even a god.
Mochulchi, petrified with fear, froze.
But, however.
Just before that…
“Alright, that’s enough.”
A carefree voice, incongruously so, echoed through the divine realm.
And then.
<<<MUGI!?>>>
Countless ropes and cloths… suddenly appeared!
They wrapped around Muwidgi’s body… and started to bind it!!
It seems this story isn’t over yet.
