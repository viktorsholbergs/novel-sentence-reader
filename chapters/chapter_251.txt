Coming back to his senses, Li Tongya nodded lightly and transmitted his voice using his mana, "If you ever pass by Moongaze Lake, feel free to rest at Mount Lijing. You are most welcome there."
Lingu Lie's face lit up with joy. Although he was a scion of a prominent clan, having been stationed abroad for many decades left him isolated and far from the political center of his family.
Now, having the opportunity to connect with a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator greatly delighted him, and he thanked Li Tongya profusely.
Li Tongya picked up his cup and sipped his drink silently for several moments.
Understanding this cue, Lingu Lie cupped his fist and bade him farewell. As Li Tongya turned to observe the other cultivators at the gathering, he noticed they had already heatedly argued to the point of embarrassment.
He chuckled lightly, put down his cup, and almost immediately, the arguing cultivators quieted down and took their seats obediently, resuming their conversations in hushed tones.
While Li Tongya had been conversing with Lingu Lie, he kept an eye on the Daoist Masters on the platform. The sword-bearing Daoist Master Shangyuan merely raised his cup and then disappeared from his seat. The Yue Cultivating Sect was represented only by him, and with his departure, his seat was left conspicuously empty.
Once Daoist Master Shangyuan had left, the other Daoist Masters drank a couple of cups as a formality and then departed using their spells. Only two, who seemed to be from the Purple Mansion Realm immortal clans, stayed a bit longer to chat with Xiao Chuting before they too made their exit.
Xiao Chuting then vanished from sight, leaving the disciples of the three sects and seven gates feeling more at ease. Most left directly, while the rest engaged in lively discussions or sword sparring.
Li Tongya paid special attention to Lingyanzi, who had not stopped eating since he had sat down and was constantly stuffing his mouth, smacking his lips without engaging in conversation with those next to him. When he had cleared everything in front of him, he looked wistfully at his neighbor's table.
A cultivator from the Purple Smoke Gate bluntly interrupted his actions, and Lingyanzi, embarrassed, could only sit there awkwardly and drink his wine, appearing quite lonely.
"Lingyanzi does not seem to be doing so well in the Purple Smoke Gate... looks like he is having a tough time," Li Tongya observed, shaking his head and doubting whether Lingyanzi still had a hundred Spirit Stones in his storage pouch.
After waiting a bit longer, Lingyanzi finally couldn't sit still and took to the skies. Li Tongya quickly followed. Just outside the formation, Lingyanzi, quick as a whip, turned around and asked sternly, "Who dares to tail me?"
Li Tongya revealed himself with a light laugh, replying, "Senior Lingyanzi, it has been many years since we last met… Do you still remember me? I'm rouge cultivator Wan."
"You..."
Lingyanzi's expression shifted dramatically as he uttered that single word, quickly swallowing the rest of his sentence. He had lived over a hundred years and instantly understood that Li Tongya didn't want to leave any trace of their past dealings, which was why he referred to himself as rogue cultivator Wan.
He thought to himself with awe, Li Tongya is really damn cautious!
Lingyanzi managed a bitter smile and said, "It has been many years, Brother Wan."
"Would you honor me by sharing a couple of drinks?" Li Tongya asked warmly, and Lingyanzi could only nod. He followed Li Tongya back into the gathering reluctantly, where they found a spot at the less prestigious end of the hall.
It was then that Lingyanzi suddenly realized something and exclaimed, "You have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm?!"
Li Tongya nodded. Lingyanzi gasped in astonishment and said in a low voice, "Congratulations, Brother Wan!"
Lingyanzi was also a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator now. Li Tongya acknowledged him with a smile and said, "Congratulations to us both! By the way, I have been eagerly awaiting news from you, Senior."
Lingyanzi felt extremely awkward and let out a dry laugh, then explained quietly, "Those spoils of war, I turned them all into Spirit Stones. However, when I saw that I was on the verge of reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, I could not resist spending them all on spirit medicines to attempt the breakthrough... To fail in returning this life-saving favor is truly... hard to express!"
"Oh." Li Tongya nodded, understanding Lingyanzi's actions. Hardly anyone could resist such a temptation. If it had been him, Li Tongya, in such a situation, he would have used the Spirit Stones for his breakthrough without hesitation, thinking about compensating for them only after he succeeded with the breakthrough.
He said gently, "Senior need not worry. Being in such a position, I would have chosen to make the breakthrough too… It's a natural human reaction."
Lingyanzi sighed softly, his eyes slightly moist with a touch of emotion. He responded, "Brother Wan understands human nature so well… Lingyanzi admires you!"
After taking a slow sip of wine, he continued, "Over the years, I have lived frugally, managing the expenses of my peak while maintaining my own cultivation. I've saved up the rest and I-I…"
He pulled out the dharma sword from his waist, its surface gleaming with light, and placed it on the table with earnest intent.
"Until now, I still use this sword of the Qi Cultivation Realm to save up Spirit Stones for Brother Wan."
Li Tongya nodded, acknowledging Lingyanzi's effort and reflecting inwardly with a mix of amusement and bitterness.
This is what defines the three sects and seven gates… The Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators in my Li Family still use mundane tools, while only those in the Qi Cultivation Realm can use Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifacts. As the only Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in my family, aside from the Qingche Sword I carry, I still use Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts… Yet to Lingyanzi, the struggle of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator using Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifacts seems a significant hardship.
Seeing Lingyanzi's tearful look, Li Tongya could empathize with his feeling of injustice, although he could not relate to such a privileged hardship. He showed just the right amount of compassion and said seriously, "Senior, there is no need to rush. You can hand me those Spirit Stones whenever; there is no need to be so hard on yourself."
Lingyanzi nodded deeply, visibly touched, and wiped his aged face. "My cultivation technique is unique; I often need to consume spirit wine and food to avoid dry mouth and stagnation in my cultivation. In severe cases, I could experience a Qi Deviation, leading to a regression in my skills. If it were not for this difficult condition, I would not have to struggle day by day…" he shared, a vulnerable expression crossing his face.
"Such a cultivation technique exists...?" Li Tongya asked, taken aback, secretly marveling that only the likes of the three sects and seven gates could afford such a demanding practice.
Looking at the sad look on Lingyanzi's face, Li Tongya finally understood why he had been so unpopular at the Purple Smoke Gate. He gave an awkward smile and asked, "How many Spirit Stones have you managed to save up over these years, Senior?"
At this, Lingyanzi looked down, his demeanor like that of a chastened child. "Twenty Spirit Stones…" he finally confessed awkwardly.
Li Tongya was momentarily speechless but wasn't ready to let Lingyanzi off so easily. He raised his hand without any reservation and took the reluctantly offered Spirit Stones, saying softly, "How about this… Do you have any items of equivalent value that you could trade for these stones, so you do not have to save up year after year?"
"This..." Lingyanzi seemed tempted by such an offer, pondering for a few moments before taking off his storage pouch and pouring out a collection of items. He then stated, "Aside from the secret techniques of my gate and the legacy treasure of my peak—the Purple Smoke Spirit Shield… feel free to pick anything, Brother Wan!"
