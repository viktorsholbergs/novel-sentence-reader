After two years of careful nurturing, Lu Jiangxian observed the murky qi of heaven and earth surging within the mirror, accompanied by flowing golden light and a subtly rising aura. With his divine sense, he traced the connection from the mirror to the talisman seed.
"Li Xuanfeng has established his foundation…" he murmured.
The feedback from Li Xuanfeng's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm was even less substantial than before, only slightly strengthening his divine sense and the Profound Light, just like when Li Chejing first broke through to the Qi Cultivation Realm.
The subsequent breakthroughs of other Li Family members in the Qi Cultivation Realm gradually showed diminishing returns, generally lacking any significant qualitative change.
Now that I have the means, I need to grow a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator…
As Lu Jiangxian's mastery of shamanic talismans grew stronger, he gradually possessed more shamanic techniques. To his dismay, all of them were of the Moonlight lineage, which drew unwanted attention and made it likely that all the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators would covet any Auspicious Children[1] he raised…
I'll just have to wait for the Li Family to offer that Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's dharma blood before I can plan further.
The talisman qi was condensed by mixing essence qi, incense, and soul. A Purple Mansion Realm cultivator's dharma blood could not be obtained easily, and Lu Jiangxian had to rely on the ritual performed by the Li Family to get it inside the mirror.
"It's a pity that the mirror can't house cultivators for now… Otherwise, everything would be much easier!"
He mused to himself for a while before a fragmented voice reached his ears.
"The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine with unwavering devotion year upon year… Observing the three yuan festivals and six regular festivals, we maintain reverence—ensuring to pay timely respects… Through the smoke of our offerings and the blood of our sacrifice…"
Swoosh.
A white light pierced through the layers of gloomy clouds and mist, landing in Lu Jiangxian's hand while a series of red beads also appeared on the table. Lu Jiangxian used his mana to secure them and first examined the talisman qi in his hand.
"It's a mid-stage Qi Cultivation Realm demonic creature."
He assessed that the talisman qi was somewhat weak. Mount Dali was challenging to access, and most of the demonic creatures in Moongaze Lake were cunning and grouped together; capturing this demon must have been quite a feat.
"It is good that I still have reserves."
Lu Jiangxian had saved many excess Qi Cultivation Realm gray talisman qi left over from the Li Family's previous sacrifice rituals. He drew out a strand and combined it with the weak gray talisman qi in his hand. The Li Family still had plenty of talisman pills, so no further additions were necessary.
His divine sense swept over the jade platform on the mountain where the Li Family members who had received a talisman seed stood.
"Talisman qi can assist in breakthroughs and improve cultivation progress… It is best bestowed upon a Qi Cultivator. Since the generations of Xi and Yue are still Embryonic Breathing cultivators, it is better to save this until there is a Foundation Establishment Realm white talisman to give out."
Then again, talisman qi could only be granted to those who had received a talisman seed. After much consideration, Lu Jiangxian's gaze settled on Li Xuanxuan, who appeared emaciated and aged after narrowly escaping death with the Blood Escape Technique previously.
Sixty years of arduous effort, and now his cultivation path has been obstructed... Perhaps I should bestow this talisman on him. With a pill, he should be able to elevate to the late stage of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
With a deft movement, the gray talisman flew into Li Xuanxuan's brow like a meteor.
A light appeared before Lu Jiangxian's eyes and several gray characters emerged—Holding Profit and Keeping Prosperity.
Unlike in the past when the Li Family members had several talisman qi to choose from, Li Xuanxuan was given only one option.
This particular talisman qi, though uncommon, could slightly enhance the success rate of alchemy, talisman drawing, and other hundred arts of immortal cultivation. Based on Lu Jiangxian's current understanding of talisman qi, it should also be able to balance fortunes, calm storms and mitigate any potential turmoil.
"This talisman qi is a decent one for Li Xuanxuan… It's a blend of fate and divine ability. With its protection, he should be able to live a few more years."
After bestowing the talisman qi, Lu Jiangxian returned his attention to the blood beads on his table.
With a gentle manipulation of his mana, the blood beads quickly melted and merged, forming a fist-sized crimson jade pearl. Lu Jiangxian swept his divine sense through it, silently discerning the divine ability it harbored.
I knew it… Chi Buzi's Dao foundation is the Heavy Murk.
If Chi Wei could advance to the peak of the Purple Mansion Realm, then surely the Azure Pond Sect must have a complete set of cultivation techniques to build the Dao Partners. I wonder which metallic essence these Dao Partners are after…
Observing the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators of Jiangnan, they all seem intent on avoiding cultivating the same Dao lineage. If it is the Pristine Water Origin Talisman Essence they are looking for, will it impact the Pristine Water True Monarch?
Lu Jiangxian's limited understanding of cultivation realms above the Purple Mansion left him with a nagging doubt.
I guess I can only wait for a more suitable time to gather further information…

When blood was spilled on Mount Lijing's jade platform, the catfish demon collapsed immediately. Blood light and incense slowly floated away, invisible to the onlookers.
Li Xuanxuan was closely monitoring the younger ones in the family when he suddenly felt something stirring in his Shenyang Mansion. A gray light appeared and the mana in his body surged.
Stunned by the unexpected surge in mana, Li Xuanxuan's face flushed. After a few moments, he grasped the situation and quickly seated himself cross-legged.
The Li Family members quickly stepped back, and after the time it took for a stick of incense to burn, Li Xuanxuan's cultivation realm had risen from the fourth to the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He slowly exhaled and opened his eyes.
"Congratulations, Father!" a group of juniors said in unison.
Li Xuanxuan stroked his beard, smiling broadly as he explained the function of his new talisman qi to his family.
"I never thought I'd receive talisman qi at this old age, and its effects align so well with my needs… With this, my success rate in crafting talismans has improved!"
He laughed, then cheerfully pulled Li Yuanjiao closer and said, "Maybe I should stabilize my cultivation for a few years, then use that talisman pill to reach the late stage of Qi Cultivation Realm and boost our family's combat power."
Li Yuanjiao naturally congratulated him and nodded in agreement, inwardly pleased with the outcome.
Despite that, the blood of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator had not been particularly impactful. It had merely produced a gray talisman. While it looked more refined than usual and glowed slightly brighter, it was still just a gray talisman and too ordinary to be given to Ximing or Xijun.
By the time a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator emerges in our family, those two children should also be in the Qi Cultivation Realm… Perhaps by then, we should hunt for a Foundation Establishment Realm demon to request a talisman for them.
Two separate sacrificial rituals were being conducted at the mountain. The one hosted by those who had received a talisman seed in the Li Family took place atop the mountain, while another happening at the foot of the mountain was overseen by Li Xicheng. As the eldest of the generation of Xi and Yue, Li Xicheng led the others in his generation in a ceremony that was both lively and vibrant.
Li Yuanping had planned everything meticulously. Although Li Xicheng initially felt awkward about not receiving a talisman seed, his role in managing the ceremony proved to be a strategic decision. It not only prevented him from feeling out of place but also provided valuable exposure for the younger members of the Xi and Yue generation.
Feeling the weight of his responsibilities, Li Xicheng had begun preparing half a year ago. Now, with the ritual successfully completed without a hitch, he finally let out a sigh of relief and noticed only then that his back was soaked with sweat.
As soon as he changed his clothes after descending from the sacrificial platform, someone came over to inform him that Li Yuanjiao wished to see him.
Without further delay, Li Xicheng hurried up the mountain. Upon entering the main hall, he saw a man dressed in a black robe sitting at the center, his brow furrowed with concern.
Ever since the passing of the Old Ancestor, Second Uncle rarely smiles…
Unbeknownst to Li Yuanjiao, these changes in him were more apparent to Li Xicheng, who, being significantly older than his younger brothers, remembered vividly what Li Yuanjiao was like in his youth.
Given his kind and generous nature, Li Xicheng was an empathetic person. He kneeled and greeted, "Xicheng pays his respects to Second Uncle of the fourth lineage! Congratulations on your significant advancement in immortal cultivation!"
1. The Auspicious Children in this context refers to whoever in the Li Family that received a talisman seed. ☜
