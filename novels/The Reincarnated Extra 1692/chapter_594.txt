“It’s been discovered that creatures with strong magic power can protect their bodies with that magic power. That’s the same reason why some large dragons can maintain their huge bodies without eating much. Even without eating or drinking, as long as mana is supplied… Hmm! A month and a half should be more than enough!”
Majurog, who had been pacing back and forth, organizing her thoughts as she spoke, stopped, clapped her hands—Paan—and smiled brightly!
But that smile immediately disappeared.
Majurog, frowning, stared at me and said—
“…But I’ve never heard of a human who can do that.”
And then, with a gloomy expression, she sighed.
“You were just doing it.”
“This body of mine… this Magic Prosthetic Body is specially made. It was designed to be able to replenish its energy with 【Absorption】! I’ve never successfully used 【Absorption】 in my previous, flesh-and-blood body…”
“Why?”
“The biggest reason is that mana control is simply difficult.”
And saying that, Majurog extended her right hand, her five fingers outstretched.
And then, a fireball, water ball, light ball, lightning ball, and dark ball appeared at the tip of each finger!
“Can you do this, Emi-chan?”
I shook my head.
I don’t know how to create a lightning ball, and I don’t understand what that jet-black dark ball even is, and more importantly…
<What! To use five different special abilities… Magic at the same time!>
It’s a feat of delicate mana control that even Extra-sama is impressed by.
I don’t think I can use special abilities that precisely yet.
Five types at the same time is definitely impossible.
“As expected of ‘The Great Mage’…”
“No, this is a feat I couldn’t accomplish in my flesh-and-blood body. This Magic Prosthetic Body has an incredibly high affinity for Magic.”
So that’s why you can easily use 【Absorption】?
Majurog, rotating the five different spheres at her fingertips, continued, with a bitter expression.
“Running on walls, producing jet-black something… I’ve already confirmed through the security cameras that Emi-chan can use several types of magic. However…”
And then Majurog clenched her open hand.
At the same time, the five spheres dispersed and disappeared.
“Absorbing mana… so to speak, it’s a type of mana transfer, which is the basis of magic, but it requires very delicate mana control. If done poorly, it will lead to a counterproductive result of ‘the mana used to absorb mana being greater than the mana absorbed’. And if you absorb too much mana, you might die from mana sickness. Furthermore, mana control is not the kind of skill that can be acquired overnight.”
Majurog, putting her hand on her forehead, started pacing again.
“Moreover, there’s no established training method. Based on my experience, even through trial and error… you might not be able to learn it. It’s a bad gamble, with the risk of death. I wouldn’t be so irresponsible as to teach you such a technique…”
“But I have no choice but to do it.”
I declared, staring back at Majurog, who was rambling.
“If I don’t do it, I’ll die. So I’ll do it. Before I worry, I’ll do it first.”
And I extended both arms forward.
I opened my palms, facing upwards.
“I can also control mana a little.”
Saying that, I used two special abilities… or what Majurog calls magic!
“Oh…!”
Majurog, seeing that, let out an interested voice.
Right now, on my right palm, a small flame is crackling.
This is 【Ignition】.
My survival companion.
And on my left palm, a small puddle of water has formed.
This is 【Water Collection】.
My survival companion.
Both are special abilities I’ve been using since I lived in the Naso Forest… but they’re also techniques that haven’t developed much.
After all, these special abilities were just survival tools for me.
Because my enemies would die if I punched them.
But.
“Teach me.”
But I… I can also use Magic just like Majurog.
I also have 【Silverfish】, 【Mana Slashing Threads】, and 【Black Arms】.
I’m not a complete amateur.
“【Absorption】… how to absorb mana, teach me.”
So I’ll learn.
And I’ll definitely master it.
A new technique!
I’ve always been able to do it.
So I’m sure I can do it this time too!
“………………”
Majurog and I stared at each other in silence for a while.
But.
“…Kakaka!”
The first to break the silence was Majurog’s laughter.
After laughing for a while, Majurog brought her beautiful face closer to mine… and looked into my eyes.
“Emi-chan… you’re amazing! Even in this desperate situation, your eyes are burning with fighting spirit! That’s right… that’s right! Never give up! Kakakakaka!”
“I will live. I will survive any predicament.”
Saying that, I stared back into Majurog’s eyes.
Her purple eyes, which had been wavering anxiously, are now shining brightly, filled with motivation and curiosity, like those of a boy who has come up with a prank!
Now, I must not look away from those eyes.
I really want to learn.
I continued to convey that feeling, directly, from my eyes to hers!
“Well, you’re the one who caused this predicament, Emi-chan…”
I quickly averted my gaze.
“Anyway, alright, I’ve made up my mind! Therefore… Emi-chan! From now on, you’re my student! You are now a student of exploration, seeking to master magic and unravel the mysteries of the world!”
Next, Majurog, putting her hands on her hips, stood up proudly, and declared that clearly, in a loud voice.
“Although still immature, as your predecessor, I will help you grow. You can think of me as your father, and rely on me!”
She smiled beautifully!
But… wait a minute.
I tilted my head.
“Your current body is a woman’s… ‘father’?”
“Then think of me as your mother, and rely on me!”
“Well… my stepmother is very particular about the word ‘mother’, so that’s a little…”
“Fine, then Master! Call me Master!”
“Sorry. I already have someone I call Master, so absolutely not.”
“WHAT!? THEN WHAT SHOULD I DO!?”
Looking at Majurog, who was holding her head and screaming, I thought for a bit.
And then I bowed my head.
“‘Sensei’… Please take care of me.”
“…Kakaka, ‘Sensei’, huh.”
Majurog, seeing me like that, chuckled and scratched her head.
“…Certainly, that fits the best. I’m also used to being called that…”
And then, she narrowed her eyes, looking happy, but also a little lonely.
