"Moo!" The big black ox's expression darkened with anger. The newcomers clearly had ill intentions and didn’t seem like the type to reason.
A flash of lightning flickered in Chen Xun’s eyes as he probed their strength. Three of them were at the mid-stage of the Nascent Soul, and two at the early stage, with the rest all at the Golden Core stage. Such a formidable group could easily establish a sect in the Qian Nation.
“Brother Xun... what do we do? Should we run?” Little Red trembled in fear, hiding behind Chen Xun. The rain made the five small boats on the sea appear even more eerie, flickering in and out of sight.
This island must be hiding something extraordinary; otherwise, it wouldn’t be unmarked on the sea chart.
Little Red had never faced such powerful opponents before, and those figures didn’t even seem human!
“Little Red, stay behind us,” Chen Xun said, remaining seated on his chair, his expression unusually calm. He glanced at the big black ox. “Old Ox, these are indeed the terrifying The Great Li Realm heretics.”
The big black ox turned to Chen Xun and nodded solemnly, steam pouring from its nostrils. The chains of the five elements slowly emerged from its body, releasing an oppressive, terrifying aura.
Little Red felt his heart race, his face turning pale. Something was wrong with the spiritual energy around them, and even his own spiritual energy was beginning to slow down.
He looked in terror at the big black ox, who now appeared to be bathed in radiant light—but it wasn’t spiritual energy!
On the turbulent sea, the five boats suddenly came to a stop, as though something was off.
“Master, that man and the two spirit beasts are definitely at the Golden Core stage,” one of the black-robed figures reported in a sinister voice, his hand entwined with an eerie white light. “That tree doesn’t seem to belong to The Great Li Realm.”
“There’s more to this than meets the eye. Form the array!” The old woman raised her head and locked eyes with Chen Xun across the shore. Her calm words carried the weight of a shout, “Don’t hold back.”
“Yes.”
“Yes.”
The black-robed figures from the five boats shot into the sky, their eerie white spiritual energy beams instantly linking together, forming a massive surging white flow ahead of them.
“Xuan Yin Annihilation Spirit Array!”
With a roar, the black-robed figures unleashed their power. The sky seemed to crack as a huge crimson array appeared beneath their feet, using their own bodies as the core of the formation. Breaking the array meant death.
Dark energy swirled, rising into the air and condensing into a massive black orb that sent ripples across the sea.
In an instant, countless killing blades shot out from the black orb with terrifying speed!
Swoosh!
Swoosh!
Swoosh!
The sea evaporated into steam wherever the blades passed, and even the heavy rain sizzled with piercing sounds.
These blades moved so fast and with such ferocity that there was no chance for a mere Golden Core cultivator to react—they were meant to kill with a single strike!
Moo!!
In the raging storm, the big black ox soared into the air, letting out a thunderous bellow. The five-element flags burst from its Nascent Soul, and the world was flooded with a blinding five-colored light.
A massive protective screen enveloped Chen Xun, Little Red, and their great boat, shielding them from the giant waves already rising around them.
Boom!
At the very moment, the killing blades arrived, the two immense forces collided heavily. The impact shook the entire sky.
A vast water curtain surged up from the center of the battle, and a powerful wave of energy exploded outward, leaving three dim glimmers in its wake.
The three Nascent Soul black-robed figures locked their icy gazes on the big black ox and charged forward, weapons drawn, sealing off all escape routes. There were no words exchanged.
The big black ox glanced at Chen Xun, who gave a slight nod.
“Moo!!” The big black ox turned into a blur of light, instantly launching into battle. Its speed was so great that Little Red could only hear explosions of spiritual energy, unable to follow the fight at all. It was terrifying!
“Brother Xun, what is Ox Brother’s true power...?” Little Red stood dumbfounded, his scalp tingling. He had never seen them truly fight before. “And these black-robed people are no pushovers either.”
“No need to worry.” Chen Xun’s eyes turned cold as he shifted his gaze to the two Nascent Soul black-robed figures still on the small boat.
The two exchanged a glance, their brows furrowing. That big black ox spirit beast was a Nascent Soul cultivator and was fighting evenly against three other Nascent Souls. How had they failed to notice this before?
“Act now—delay will bring disaster. That spirit beast is protecting the man.”
“Yes.”
Their eyes gleamed ominously as they moved without hesitation, transforming into shadows that vanished from the boat in an instant.
In the blink of an eye, they appeared on the shore, their right hands conjuring enormous, deadly black swords. These swords were not ordinary magical tools, but God-killing Weapons that made any cultivator tremble in fear!
Swoosh!
Swoosh!
The wind howled, and the sea churned with waves several stories high. The two black-robed figures charged at Chen Xun, their God-killing Swords erupting with a fearsome destructive power aimed straight at him.
“Brother Xun!!!” Little Red screamed in terror, his eyes wide with fear. The attack was too fast, and even his divine sense was blocked, leaving him no time to react.
“Die!” The two black-robed figures grinned wickedly. They were now within inches of Chen Xun, close enough to see the pores on his face.
Yet Chen Xun remained calm, still seated, with a shield of spiritual energy already in place before him.
Boom!
A violent gust of wind swept out in all directions. The two black-robed figures’ expressions shifted dramatically, as though struck by lightning. Their God-killing Weapons hadn’t even cracked the spiritual energy shield, and the man seemed completely unaffected by the weapon’s deadly power.
Chen Xun’s eyes narrowed slightly. The appearance of these two was truly bizarre—neither human nor ghost.
Their failed strike sent them retreating dozens of meters in shock. They took a sharp breath, staring at Chen Xun, who stood unscathed. What kind of monster was this?
“Who are you?!” one of them demanded.
“Stop wasting time. Either you ascend today, or I make a run for it,” Chen Xun said, rising slowly. His robe fluttered in the wind, and an overwhelming aura began to rise. “You show up wanting to rob me and kill my brothers. You're being awfully disrespectful.”
Little Red’s hair stood on end, retreating from Chen Xun’s imposing aura. To this day, he still didn’t know where his two brothers had come from. With such power, who could they possibly be?
“Summon the Ghost Infant!” the old woman barked, her expression fierce. This matter wouldn’t be easily resolved.
“Yes.”
The other black-robed figure nodded solemnly. They had certainly kicked a hornet’s nest, but such a powerful figure was one they had never heard of. Where had he come from?
Ominous wails filled the air as the two black-robed figures clashed their palms together, and waves of ghostly fire surged forth. The power of their Nascent Souls erupted, forming a towering Ghost Infant behind them, dressed in black robes but with a skull covered in fur.
The Ghost Infant stretched its arms wide, transforming into a massive hand of ghostly flame that descended upon Chen Xun.
Chen Xun snorted coldly, and a dazzling light of the five elements erupted around him, surging with boundless power.
A Nascent Soul projection burst forth from his body, towering into the sky. The Ghost Infant shrank in comparison, and the swirling ghost energy recoiled as if facing a natural enemy.
With a single punch from Chen Xun’s Nascent Soul projection, the giant hand of ghostly flame shattered into pieces.
