The Yu Family had been quiet recently. Yu Mugao was busy organizing the clan, killing some members some days and releasing others the next. Despite the numerous brothers, they could not fight back at all and were slaughtered like lambs daily.
"He really dares to kill..." Li Yuanping mumbled as he looked at the list of names and pursed his lips. He thought to himself and concluded that although Yu Mugao enjoyed the killing, he had left behind many hidden dangers. Shaking his head, he turned his attention back to the families on the eastern shore.
There were more than a dozen families scattered along the eastern shore, though most were small families at the Embryonic Breathing or Qi Cultivation Realms. The situation was quite complex with many entanglements, so few people dared to interfere.
Both the northern and eastern shores of Moongaze Lake used to be the territory of the Golden Tang Gate, and the eastern shore families had numerous connections with the Golden Tang Gate. Although the gate had weakened and lost this territory, some relationships remained. This was one factor.
Another factor was that the eastern shore families held several valuable ore veins and spirit springs, and all were secretly controlled by the Xiao Family from the west. Xiao Family members guarded these places under the guise of guest cultivators, enabling them the power to maintain the situation while profiting from it.
This arrangement should not have been allowed, but the Azure Pond Sect had turned a blind eye to this. The Xiao Family preferred to see the situation fragmented, and so this arrangement remained for years.
Moreover, Moongaze Lake bordered the Xiao Family's territory. These families maintained the buffer zone, bordering the Golden Tang Gate to the north and the Li and Ding families to the south. The competition among various forces made the area highly sensitive.
These factors combined to maintain the status quo among the eastern shore families, with no significant changes for a hundred years. When the Jiang Family prospered, they supported them; and when the Yu Family dominated, they supported them. Now, with the Yu Family's decline and a tripartite power structure on the lake, each family sought its own protector.
Back when the market collapsed and the Yu Family declined, our family had the opportunity to take over some tributary families. However, we were understaffed at the time and only wanted to bide our time, so we missed our chance.
Li Yuanping thought for a moment, his heart stirring with ambition. He thought to himself, Now that our family's finances are tight, if we could intervene... we could gain some tributes and support some forces on the eastern shore...
While considering the feasibility of this idea, he called to Dou Yi at the lower seat.
"Go to the Clan Affairs Courtyard and get me a report on the eastern shore families."
Dou Yi quickly nodded and hurried off. Unexpectedly, another person ran up from below and said respectfully, "Reporting to Family Head! There is a cultivator seeking an audience on the road!"
"A cultivator on the road..?"
Li Yuanping was slightly taken aback. Knowing that anyone who was reported up to the hall must not be any simple or trivial matter, he took this seriously. "What is their cultivation level? Are they seeking something?" he asked.
The clan guard hesitated and answered, "According to Master An, the person is likely not a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator. They wear a robe with cuffed sleeves and appear youthful. I heard that their aura far surpasses the Foundation Establishment Realm… As for their business here, they insist on seeing you personally."
An Zheyan had seen powerful figures like Yu Xiaogui and Li Tongya in the past and could roughly estimate the strength of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Hearing that this person far surpassed the Foundation Establishment Realm made Li Yuanping's expression fall solemn.
"Not a Purple Mansion Golden Core Dao cultivator!? Seeking my presence?" Li Yuanping was momentarily stunned and then said sternly, "Go and inform Brother Jiao, but... no need to have him come over. Let him keep watch on the mountain... Have Master An and others ready to suppress this person in case they suddenly act up."
Li Yuanping's face looked somewhat grim. He always despised unexpected troubles, especially when the other party, despite politely visiting, had a cultivation far beyond the Foundation Establishment Realm. If they caused trouble, the Li Family could not handle it.
"Damn it!" he cursed in frustration, then exhaled and said softly, "Escort him to the side hall to wait."
"Yes!" Dou Yi responded as the others quickly retreated.
Li Yuanping sat back on the main seat, thinking to himself, Though he doesn't look like a Buddhist cultivator, he might be disguising himself... Maybe he's a devil cultivator... Our family has never encountered a devil cultivator from Jiangnan, but we've heard they look no different from ordinary people. We might not be able to recognize them.
He took two steps down the stairs. After all, it was a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator visiting. In the Li Family, only he had enough weight to handle this, without risking too much loss if things went awry.
"This is not the time to show weakness… It would be bad if he became suspicious. I should go meet him," Li Yuanping mumbled to himself quietly as he walked to the front of the hall and stepped lightly toward the corridor. As he walked, he saw Li Wen following him, carrying a mace as big as a human head without saying a word.
Seeing Li Wen's immense figure, Li Yuanping felt a bit more confident and smiled.
"What a sturdy fellow you are!" he remarked.
"Hehe," Li Wen chuckled in response.
When Li Yuanping reached the side hall, he said gently, "You do not need to come in. Just wait outside."
After all, the gap between Foundation Establishment Realm and Qi Cultivation Realm was too vast. According to An Zheyan's description, if Li Wen went in, it would only take one palm strike from the visitor to send him flying, which would make them seem weak.
Seeing Li Wen nod dumbly, Li Yuanping pushed the door open and entered.
The side courtyard was simple and unadorned, with only a few wooden tables. Sitting by one small table was a young man with an ordinary face and a daoist crown on his head. A wooden sword rested on his knees, which appeared to be made of peach wood.
He looked to be only about twenty years old, wearing a plain Daoist robe with golden embroidery on the cuffs of an unknown origin. The peach wood sword seemed ordinary and dull, not like any precious treasure.
A Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator at twenty years old?
Li Yuanping secretly assumed that this person must be using an illusion to disguise his appearance, becoming even more cautious.
"The Li Family welcomes you, Senior… May I ask how to address you?" Li Yuanping stepped forward with a smile, speaking politely yet confidently.
"Greetings, Family Head! I am Wang Xun from Yinghua Prefecture in Zhao State! Thank you for your hospitality!"
Unexpectedly, the young cultivator reacted with great enthusiasm, jumping up from his seat almost right away. The peach wood sword on his knees flipped in the air and floated lightly. Wang Xun, seemingly unaware, had responded courteously.
Seeing his response and demeanor, Li Yuanping felt slightly relieved. He glanced unobtrusively at the peach wood sword and smiled as he said, "Oh, a guest from Zhao State! I am Li Yuanping… Apologies for keeping you waiting."
"No need for apologies!" The man smiled in return. Seeing Li Yuanping not taking the main seat but instead choosing to sit to the side, Wang Xun's tense expression relaxed, and he also sat down.
Watching the young man's sincere reactions, Li Yuanping felt even more at ease and called out, "Serve the tea!"
The attendants quickly brought the tea, placed it before them, and left hurriedly. Li Yuanping smiled, observing the shy and bashful young man in front of him while still on guard. "May I ask, Senior... Where do you come from? Is there anything you need? If my family can help, we will certainly do so."
The young man seemed unaccustomed to worldly interactions and had not mentioned his background. Li Yuanping asked about his background to gauge if he belonged to a significant sect or family, which would inform his response.
Still smiling courteously, he poured tea from a jade pot.
The young man hesitated, nodding repeatedly, as though he had already expected to be asked about his family lineage. I come from the Wang Family in Yinghua, a great-grandson of True Monarch Xiaojin and the son of Daoist Master Yingyuan..." he replied hurriedly.
"Wow..."
Li Yuanping felt as if he had been slapped out of nowhere, and his head buzzed. His steady hand suddenly shook, spilling several drops of tea.
"True Monarch Xiaojin! A Golden Core Realm cultivator!" he exclaimed.
He looked up in shock and stammered, "Senior... you say you are the great-grandson of a True Monarch and the son of a Daoist Master?!"
