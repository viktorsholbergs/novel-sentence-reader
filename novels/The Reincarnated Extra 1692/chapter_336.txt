(Cursed Child) The “Flower Shop’s” Last “Mischief”
* * *
Grandma Numbri collapsed in the afternoon, while the sun was still high.
She hasn’t woken up yet.
It’s almost midnight.
In less than an hour, it will be ‘Dawn Day’.
“…………”
Until now, I’ve been sitting by Grandma’s bedside, just holding her hand tightly.
Of course, I did other things too.
Naturally, I called a doctor.
Right after Grandma collapsed, I carried the doctor from the hospital Grandma usually goes to and had him examine her.
……The doctor just shook his head…… He didn’t prescribe any medicine or anything.
<Emi……>
Hesitantly, Extra-sama called out to me.
<I’m sorry, but…… Numbri is probably……>
And she uttered words of resignation.
But…… it was at that moment.
“Mmm…… cough, Emi……?”
“!?”
Coughing, Grandma…… slightly opened her eyes.
“Grandma.”
“Cough, cough…… Oh my, oh my, it’s already so dark…… I overslept. Did you close the shop?”
“I closed it.”
“What about dinner?”
“I already ate. I saved some for you too.”
“Is that so, is that so…… What time is it……?”
“Past 11 o’clock.”
“Is that…… so. Cough.”
Wheezing, she exhaled with difficulty.
After talking about such trivial matters with me.
Grandma smiled sadly.
“At least…… I wanted to make it to ‘Dawn Day’…… cough, but it seems I won’t make it……”
“What are you saying?”
I wiped the sweat from Grandma’s forehead, trying to appear calm.
I’m expressionless by nature.
I’m good at hiding my emotions.
“The doctor said you’re just tired. You’ll get better once you get some sleep.”
I’m supposed to be good at it.
“Hahaha…… Emi, you’re bad at lying.”
Grandma grinned and reached out to my cheek.
“Unlike me.”
She said that and wiped away my tears.
The ticking sound of the clock.
The sound of Grandma’s cough.
The sound of me sniffing.
For a while, those sounds filled the room, that was all.

“Hey, Emi.”
Glancing at me as I continued to tremble slightly with tears streaming down my face, Grandma coughed and grinned.
“I’m an old woman now.”
“…………”
“I’ve lived long enough.”
“…………”
“Can’t you send me off…… with a smile?”
“………… Impossible.”
I wiped my tears roughly and muttered.
“I…… have never smiled in my life.”
“What a difficult child…… you are.”
Cough, cough. After coughing again.
Grandma let out a big sigh and said that with a wry smile.
And again, silence.
“……………………”
Tick-tock, tick-tock, the sound of the clock.
There’s almost no mana leaking from Grandma anymore.
I can see it, so I understand.
That there’s really not much time left.
“……Hey.”
So, I said.
“I said it earlier, right? ‘I’ll repay you. Just tell me anything.'”
“…………”
Upon hearing those words, Grandma.
Silently closed her eyes and fell silent.
But, after a few minutes.
She clearly said.
“……There is.”
Yes, she said.
“!”
Suddenly, Grandma’s grip on my hand tightened.
I was surprised and looked at her face.
Grandma was grinning again.
But this smile was different from her previous sad smile.
It was like a mischievous child’s.
That’s the impression I got from her smile.
“Hey, Emi, I have a favor to ask.”
“Tell me anything.”
Nodding, I replied. Taking a deep breath, Grandma said to me……
“I want you…… to join me in the ‘Flower Shop’s’ last ‘mischief’.”
Her eyes were wide open and shining brightly.
