"Xiu'er!"
The man smiled triumphantly; it was none other than Li Xuanxuan. Now that he had broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm, becoming the fourth Qi Cultivator in the Li Family with a lifespan of two hundred years and the ability to ride the winds and traverse the heavens and earth, he was naturally in high spirits. Even his appearance seemed rejuvenated by several years.
"Father, you've emerged from seclusion!" Li Yuanxiu exclaimed joyfully as he descended the steps to greet his father who shook his sleeve with a proud flourish, boasting, "Your father has consumed the Cave Spring Clear Qi and condensed the Cave Spring True Essence, which brings prolonged vitality and skill in regulating qi and drawing talismans. Now, I am a Qi Cultivator! Not only me, but your granduncle has also broken through his seclusion, utilizing the power of the talisman pills to reach the ninth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm."
"That's amazing!" Li Yuanxiu grinned as he nodded repeatedly. As Li Xuanxuan displayed a wisp of pale blue true essence, revealing a lively and refreshing aura, Li Yuanxiu looked on enviously and cupped his fist.
"Now that Father is back, the stewardship of the family naturally returns to your hands."
He then stepped back, lifting his long robe slightly to kneel, indicating that he was handing back the authority of the family head to Li Xuanxuan.
Mention of this made Li Xuanxuan visibly flustered. He had managed the family for over a decade and wondered before his seclusion whether Li Yuanxiu could take over his role effectively. Upon emerging, he was surprised to learn that Li Xuanling praised the household's better order. Several elders shook their heads and sighed upon seeing him, leaving him bemused.
"Xiu'er, you're being too formal!" Li Xuanxuan said as he shook his head and stated seriously, "Now that I have achieved the Qi Cultivation Realm, I naturally need to devote myself to deep cultivation—particularly in the art of talismans, to add more depth to our family's legacy. There's no reason for a Qi Cultivator to still cling to positions of power. Perhaps in a hundred years, when our Li Family has a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and Qi Cultivators are numerous, then it would be suitable for a Qi Cultivator to lead the family. For now, you should continue to lead."
Li Xuanxuan then continued proudly, "Moreover, I was extremely pleased to hear from Xuanling how well you've managed the family over these years, so I descended the mountain to see you!"
Li Yuanxiu chuckled, his earlier remark just a formality. He knew well that Li Xuanxuan would not want the position back.
"During your seclusion, there was unrest in Mount Yue, and the heir, Shamoli, had fled eastward and is now attempting a breakthrough to the Qi Cultivation Realm in seclusion..." he said.
He then proceeded to explain their strategies against Mount Yue for the next few years. Li Xuanxuan, having already heard from Li Xuanling, listened again to Li Yuanxiu's account, then commented thoughtfully, "Shamoli's consumption of the unrefined qi is easier than pure spiritual qi of heaven and earth. This means that he's likely to emerge from seclusion within a year…"
The father and son, sitting at the head of the room, dismissed the guards and servants. Li Yuanxiu explained the family's internal strategies in detail, earning repeated nods and praise from Li Xuanxuan.
"Xuanling said you've surpassed us, but it seems he spared my feelings. This is far more than just surpassing!" he commented and laughed.
Although Li Yuanxiu was flattered, he repeatedly apologized for outshining his father. The father and son continued their cheerful conversation into the evening. The two even shared a meaningful dinner together before Li Xuanxuan returned to the mountains.
Li Tongya emerged from the cave dwelling, his body shimmering with true essence. Now a ninth heavenly layer Qi Cultivator, he was among the top cultivators over Moongaze Lake, matched only by a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. Despite this, he felt little joy, and a touch of worry tinged his mood.
"My cultivation speed is ultimately mediocre… Even using that precious talisman pill, it still took me three years to break through. Now that I'm approaching sixty, I fear I won't be able to make it!"
Feeling restless, Li Tongya exhaled slowly, looking at Li Xuanxuan's empty stone chamber, feeling somewhat relieved.
"Fortunately, Xuan'er has successfully broken through to the Qi Cultivation Realm… We have another Qi Cultivator in the family, and this child is better at talisman drawing than I am. This will add another legacy to our family..." he mumbled to himself.
Li Tongya's knowledge of talisman arts came from the Spiritual Talisman Method manual brought back by Li Chejing, which included methods for twelve Embryonic Breathing Realm talisman arts and three Qi Cultivation Realm talisman arts. These were basic but widely applicable.
Unfortunately, Li Tongya lacked talent in this area. After over a decade, he had only mastered the Embryonic Breathing Realm talismans but had never succeeded with a Qi Cultivation Realm talisman. He eventually abandoned this pursuit to focus on sword cultivation.
Li Xuanxuan, possessing greater talent and a cultivation method more suited to drawing talismans, naturally became the most suitable candidate to assume the family's talisman duties.
Reflecting on his limited success with talismans and his nearly two-decades-long contributions to creating another source of income for the family, Li Tongya suddenly realized his current cultivation mindset was unacceptable.
"I'm rushing to break through to Foundation Establishment Realm by sixty, but such eagerness for quick success is a taboo in cultivation! Thankfully, I have decades of deep cultivation and the talisman pills to support me; otherwise, being stuck at the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm for years wouldn't be surprising. That would have been a real delay!"
Relieved, Li Tongya discarded his obsession with reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm before sixty and consoled himself silently, Progressing steadily in cultivation, even if I exceed sixty, is fine. Having experienced so much in my cultivation journey, whether I achieved Foundation Establishment Realm or not, I started as a mere farmer's son and now soar between heaven and earth, wandering freely with my sword. What more could I possibly demand from the world?
Breathing out deeply, Li Tongya, self-taught and without formal guidance, was thankful he could correct his path just by being cautious and reflective.
After meditating in the grand hall of the cave dwelling, he saw his son, Li Xuanling, approaching. He was a robust young man now.
"Congratulations on ending your seclusion, Father!"
"Mm…" Li Tongya nodded, his gaze briefly sweeping over his son. He smiled proudly before saying, "You have also reached the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm… In a few years, you should break through to the Qi Cultivation Realm."
"Yes." Li Xuanling sat beside his father, carefully choosing his words before speaking. "Father, Qinghong enjoys spearmanship, but we lack a master of spears at home… I thought of finding a good mentor for her."
"Spearmanship..."
Upon hearing this, Li Tongya raised his eyebrows. He suddenly remembered the Foundation Establishment Realm spear emitting faint electricity in his storage pouch, and a man named Fei Wangbai. He was the old man in a white brocade robe who also attended the banquet hosted by the Yu Family back then and happened to be the master of the spear.
"I have heard that someone from the Fei Family on the northern shore excels in spear techniques, possessing top-tier strength around the lake. The head of the Fei Family once invited me to visit their home… Perhaps this is a good opportunity to discuss this matter and foster good relations between our families," Li Tongya responded.
"That would be perfect!"
Li Xuanling was thrilled at the prospect. Although Fei Wangbai of the Fei Family had only recently achieved a breakthrough a few years ago, he was a genuine Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator.
Even if the Fei Family was unwilling to share their most guarded techniques, instruction from a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was still far superior to that from any Qi Cultivator.
In the secret chamber of Lijing Town, Shamoli performed a series of hand seals, then held a small jade bottle. He exhaled thin wisps of pale purple air, rhythmically pulsing with each of his breaths. After eighty-one cycles, the streams gradually faded and vanished.
Shamoli suddenly opened his eyes, revealing a flicker of purple electricity, albeit slightly impure and delayed. A look of wild joy spread across his face as he clasped his hands, causing a flash of lightning-charged mana to circulate between his palms.
"Purple Thunder Secret Origin Technique! Secret Thunder True Essence truly is overwhelmingly powerful… With a single strike of this lightning, ordinary Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators could be severely wounded. No wonder everyone envies the Path of Thunder; it really is remarkable!"
Shamoli paused to feel the mana surge within his body, smacking his lips with a hint of regret. "However, for some reason, the mana inside me feels somewhat inferior to what the scriptures describe for typical cultivators… It seems suited only for quick battles and lacks endurance."
Rising to his feet, Shamoli pushed the stone door open with his palm and looked out into the courtyard. The sunlight was soft on his skin, warm and comforting, much like the throne and life he was about to embrace.
