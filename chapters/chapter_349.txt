Li Yuanjiao led a small group of boys up the mountain path and stood before the rear courtyard's formation that was shimmering in white light.
Li Xijun stared at it in awe. He gripped Li Ximing's hand and whispered, "Third Brother, is this where that rumored green and white immortal sword is…?"
"No idea," Li Ximing replied, furrowing his brow slightly. His features were sharp and smooth, yet next to Li Xijun, they seemed rather plain. "I've never set foot in this courtyard all the years I've been home…" he continued as his voice trailed off.
"This is our ancestral hall," Li Xizhi explained softly, holding his coat tightly. Being much older than Li Ximing and Li Xijun who only reached up to his waist, he spoke warmly.
"After Brother Cheng and I were assessed for spiritual orifice, we were brought here to honor our ancestors and memorize our clan's history."
Realization dawned on the two younger boys while Li Xicheng stood silently at the front. Li Yuanjiao performed a series of hand seals and cast three spells before the large formation was unlocked, allowing them into the rear hall.
In the rear hall, numerous artifacts were displayed—all weathered and ancient. Wolf skins adorned the walls, and prominently positioned among them was a bow of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Its surface bore countless scars that whispered of battles won and lost.
Li Xicheng and Li Xizhi exchanged glances, sharing a mix of both excitement and reverence. With a hushed tone, Li Xizhi whispered softly, "The Ebony Bow…"
Li Xicheng, a man of few words, grunted deeply. This was the bow that Li Xiangping had wielded, a fact well-known to both of them since they had already read and studied the Family History.
Li Yuanjiao glanced at all four of them, then produced a jade slip and said in a solemn voice, "Do you still remember the Reception Method I instructed you to memorize before?"
The four boys looked at each other before nodding in unison.
"Yes…"
"Good! That saves me from further explanations then," Li Yuanjiao praised as he stowed away the jade slip with a satisfied smile.
He then led them through a corridor and pushed open the doors to the ancestral hall. A tablet stood atop a pedestal, its presence commanding amidst the lingering incense.
"Join hands," instructed Li Yuanjiao. The four boys complied right away, each bowing as Li Yuanjiao gently tapped their foreheads, sealing their six senses. They followed him silently to the secret chamber where the bluish-gray mirror faintly glimmered, emitting wisps of ethereal haze that resembled moonlight.
After arranging the juniors in a kneeling row, Li Yuanjiao stood before them, bowing respectfully once more. Then, he stepped forward and extended his spiritual senses into the mirror, only to discover five glowing white talisman seeds within it.
"Five...?!" he murmured in astonishment before a grin broke out on his face.
Uncle Xuanfeng must have attained the Foundation Establishment Realm!
The number of talisman seeds in the mirror reflected the strength of their family. There were a total of nine after Li Tongya had attained the Foundation Establishment Realm, and now with Li Tongya gone and the count unchanged, this pretty much confirms that Li Xuanfeng had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.
"Too bad he's in the remote Yi Mountain City, unable to deliver such great news to us…" Li Yuanjiao sighed to himself.
With newfound confidence, he took a step back and recited respectfully, "The Li Family of Lijing offers respect along with fine delicacies and wine… When the time comes, we will remain true to our oath. With this talisman burned, we express our gratitude to the Supreme Yin."
Lu Jiangxian's divine sense was stirred as it emerged from the mirror, scanning the four youths kneeling before him. Invisible, colorless ripples swept through them, and faint glowing white halos emerged above each child's head.
"Yet another generation..." he mumbled to himself.
The eldest among the four was Li Xicheng, and was already about sixteen or seventeen years old. He had an honest appearance and seemed to be at the third layer of Embryonic Breathing Realm. His talent seemed decent, though the halo above his head measured only three cun, emitting a weak light. Lu Jiangxian's gaze quickly swept past him.
The second youth, who was clad in brocade and fur, bore a striking resemblance to Li Yuanjiao. He exuded a heroic air to him, and the gap between his eyebrows was small, lending him a sly look.
"This must be Li Xizhi... chosen to be sent to the Azure Pond Sect," Lu Jiangxian mumbled thoughtfully.
Li Xizhi, at the third stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm at the age of twelve or thirteen years old, boasted talent that was on par with Li Yuanjiao and Li Qinghong. Lu Jiangxian took note of his superior talent and the six-cun halo above his head.
Next was Li Ximing, whose white halo was seven cun. While his talent slightly lagged behind Li Xizhi's, Lu Jiangxian's divine sense detected something peculiar.
"Huh?!"
He scrutinized him carefully, from the Shenyang Mansion between his brow to his trachea, and finally into the Qihai acupoint, confirming his initial suspicion.
"The red haze in his sea of qi rises fourfold, and the qi in his Shenyang Mansion is stable and can harmonize water and fire… There's no sign of yin and yang imbalance… He has a natural talent for alchemy!"
Having read various alchemy texts and many relevant books from the Yu and Fei families' collections, Lu Jiangxian's knowledge far surpassed that of the Li Family. His recognition of such a trait brought him instant delight.
"Seven cun halo… After receiving the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed, he'll become a significant genius—a potential pillar for the Li Family, and a valuable asset, given his potential in alchemy!"
Having stayed in the mirror and observed the Li Family's growth over eighty years in solitude, from Li Chejing to Li Tongya, Lu Jiangxian's heart swelled with a mix of pride and nostalgia as he continued assessing the youngest descendant before him: Li Xijun.
"...Good appearance!"
Having encountered countless cultivators around the lake, including the handsome Li Chejing, the graceful Fei Wangbai, and the ethereal An Jingming, Lu Jiangxian could not help but marvel at Li Xijun's striking features.
Li Xijun, born just a month or two after Li Ximing, naturally looked to be about the same age. Despite his youthful countenance, Li Xijun's sharp eyebrows and bright eyes made him stand out among his brothers.
"His talent is mediocre, yet he possesses a nine-cun halo…" Lu Jiangxian noted, counting on his fingers. Though Li Xijun's potential was only average, his nine-cun spiritual orifice set him apart from ordinary cultivators, rivaling Li Ximing's talent before receiving a talisman seed.
"Li Ximing must receive a talisman seed… So I'll have to decide between Li Xizhi and Li Xijun."
With an abundance of talisman seeds at his disposal, Lu Jiangxian acted generously. After a moment's consideration, he waved his hand and sent out three talisman seeds.
"Li Xizhi will be joining the Azure Pond Sect; his cultivation speed will undoubtedly be superior to the rest… He deserves a seed. If Li Ximing is the only one to receive the talisman, he may struggle alone and the Li Family might eventually end up like the Yu Family… Although Li Xijun's talent is average, his nine inches of halo and the talisman seed will make him a small genius. Both of them will receive a seed too!"
The three talisman seeds hovered above their heads while Lu Jiangxian held onto the remaining two for the next generation. He then handed the Golden Temple Radiant Origin Manual, Introduction to Alchemy, and Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual to each of the three boys.
With a hand seal, the three white lights exited the bluish-gray mirror obediently. They pierced through the wisps of moonlight haze, illuminating the air with an otherworldly brilliance. The ends of these streams of light subtly split into faint seven-colored hues, creating a mesmerizing sight indeed.
"Three seeds?!" Li Yuanjiao exclaimed in delight, watching the lights descend upon the three boys. He quickly patted each of them on the shoulder, undoing their mana-sealed six senses.
"Focus your mind, hold your essence, and circulate your mana according to the instructions in the Reception Method!" he instructed.
