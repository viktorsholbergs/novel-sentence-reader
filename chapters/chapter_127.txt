The northern wind whistled through Yi Mountain City, slightly trembling the stone door of the cave dwelling atop the mountain.
Chi Zhiyun stood outside its door, his robes billowing in the breeze. He rested a finger lightly on the hilt of his sword as he waited patiently.
After a few moments, Chi Zhiyun furrowed his brow, inspecting the tiny cracks in the dark gray stone door.
He spoke softly, addressing the occupant within, "Junior brother, there's no need for further delay. Three years have passed… and with your talent, you should have broken through by now, shouldn't you?"
Silence lingered for a moment before the stone door creaked open slowly, revealing a young man in a white robe with long hair, carrying a green and white longsword on his waist. With two jade slips in each hand, he looked at Chi Zhiyun with a smile on his face.
"How can I help you, Senior Brother Chi?"
Chi Zhiyun studied Li Chejing for a moment before speaking once more.
"There's a mission from the sect. The Old Ancestor has assigned it to you."
Li Chejing nodded in acknowledgment.
"Please wait a moment, Senior Brother. I'll join you once I've made the necessary preparations," he replied respectfully.
Satisfied with Li Chejing's attitude, Chi Zhiyun departed with a wave of his sleeve.
Meanwhile, Li Chejing took note of the direction he went off before flying off toward another cave dwelling in the mountains.
"Senior Brother Xiao!"
The stone door quickly opened, and Xiao Yuansi emerged with two types of herbs in his hand and a brush in his other. He greeted Li Chejing with a smile that quickly dimmed.
"Jing'er... You've broken through!" he exclaimed in excitement.
Xiao Yuansi, despite being over sixty years old, maintained the appearance of someone in their thirties. He gazed at Li Chejing, a pang of heartache in his chest. The boy was only a child of ten when he first ascended Qingsui Peak, and Xiao Yuansi had always called him "Jing'er'' since then.
"Yes," Li Chejing smiled as he replied, then took a seat beside Xiao Yuansi.
"I have turned the six chakras in my body into the Dao foundation, known as Lake Moon Autumn, with the Moon Lake Autumn Reflection Technique! The qi is green and white, and the true essence is crystal clear and it's really versatile," he explained patiently.
A look of envy materialized on Xiao Yuansi's face. He was still stuck at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm, showing no signs of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm anytime soon.
"Establishing a foundation is beyond my comprehension for now… I've only heard that the Dao foundation of my ancestor back at home is known as 'Man On Creek'. It's really strange and difficult to describe. I can only hope to break through this barrier someday," he said with a soft sigh.
The most critical step to transition from the Qi Cultivation Realm to Foundation Establishment Realm was to transform the six chakras into various Dao foundations, which was highly perilous. A failed condensation could result in the collapse of one's cultivation and even death within a few days. To emphasize its difficulty, the success rate was less than ten percent. Even among the three sects and seven gates, the mortality rate was as high as seventy percent.
"I'm sure you'll eventually get there, Senior Brother," Li Chejing reassured him, handing over the two jade slips to Xiao Yuansi.
"I actually broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm during the first year and spent the next few years documenting my experiences and talisman techniques. When the time comes, please send my Qingche Sword back home too… I appreciate your assistance, Senior Brother."
With a thousand thoughts still swirling in his mind, Xiao Yuansi accepted the jade slips, unsure of where he could possibly begin. He watched as Li Chejing left his cave dwelling and soared into the air, overlooking the bustling crowds of Yi Mountain City.
His sudden ascent startled the onlookers below, prompting several cultivators of the Foundation Establishment Realm and a dozen Qi Cultivators in the city to soar into the sky, all fixating their gazes on him.
Chi Zhiyun swiftly ascended from the peak, shouting angrily, "Li Chejing! What do you think you are doing?!"
Li Chejing was momentarily stunned. At the same time, he was amused by how his small action had startled the group as if he were a common enemy.
"Don't worry, everyone! I won't flee! I simply have a matter or two to discuss with Senior Brother Chi," he assured with a slightly amused smile.
Embarrassment swept over the group, causing them to exchange glances before dispersing, leaving behind Chi Zhiyun, who did not seem too pleased with him. Suppressing his temper, he asked sternly, "What else do you want?!"
Li Chejing cupped his fist respectfully and continued softly, "Firstly… if I were to perish, I would like the sect to retrieve my dharma weapon."
Chi Zhiyun eyed the sword at Li Chejing's waist and grunted.
"Granted."
"Secondly, I wish to spar with Senior Brother Chi… I implore you to indulge me on this request!"
The crowd below that was eavesdropping on the conversation was stunned into silence by the unexpected request.
Chi Zhiyun, though surprised, burst out laughing right away.
"You're merely at the early stage of Foundation Establishment Realm, whereas I've been in the middle stage for over twenty years. You better not regret what you wished for!"
Internally, however, he was puzzled.
Is this child attempting suicide by provoking a confrontation to dirty my hands? How can such a stupid attempt fool the ancestor? Is he not afraid of bringing harm to his own family?
Despite this, Li Chejing cupped his fist and insisted, "Please grant my request, Senior Brother!"
Chi Zhiyun sneered inwardly.
Daoist Master Yuan Su is overseeing this city… no matter what tricks you employ, they'll be futile against a Purple Mansion cultivator. I guess I'll teach this child a lesson so he learns his place!
With a cold smile, he finally nodded and agreed.
"Fine."
Drawing his sword, he ascended into the sky, releasing a crimson sword qi that surged forth like a torrent—transforming into dozens of flying birds that had scorching and razor-sharp auras.
"His sword qi leaves his body like a spell… Senior Brother Chi must have refined it into sword essence!"
The onlookers below gasped in awestruck fervor as they watched his sword qi transforming into what seemed like birds and phoenixes.
Deng Qiuzhi raised his head and shot a look of resentment at Chi Zhiyun. He sneered coldly. "It's just sword essence," he muttered angrily through gritted teeth.
The crimson sword qi in the sky cast a crimson hue in all directions. Despite this, Li Chejing remained calm, resting his left hand on the longsword at his waist.
He made no attempt to draw it or perform any spell until the very last moment—when the sword qi closed in on him, he swiftly unsheathed his sword, unleashing a brilliant white crescent-shaped sword qi.
It was the Celestial Moon Slash technique.
Compared to Li Tongya's Celestial Moon Slash, Li Chejing's version was like the difference between a firefly and a full moon. It illuminated the surroundings like a huge white sail, dazzling the onlookers, effortlessly dispelling the incoming sword qi and flying toward Chi Zhiyun.
Chi Zhiyun frowned, defending himself with a wave of his sword. Dozens of sword qi were unleashed, but much to his surprise, they only caused Li Chejing's powerful sword qi to flicker rather than dissipate.
Astonished, Chi Zhiyun raised his sword and quickly channeled his power into it in a slight panic. The blade turned crimson, blocking the incoming sword qi.
How is this possible..?!
Chi Zhiyun was filled with shock. Before he could utter another word, he activated his mana to repel the incoming sword qi. Meanwhile, Li Chejing had already advanced, unleashing a barrage of plain sword qi.
Chi Zhiyun channeled his mana into his sword and swiftly repelled them, only to realize that these sword qi were thick and sharp, much to his dismay.
It then dawned on him, although begrudgingly, that Li Chejing's swordsmanship was far superior to his own. Drawing upon the depth of his true essence, Chi Zhiyun conjured a dozen fire spells of the Foundation Establishment Realm in an attempt to disrupt Li Chejing.
However, Li Chejing's sword sliced through the fire spells effortlessly. Explosions were heard booming through the sky, which was soon followed by fiery rain that threatened to engulf Yi Mountain City entirely. Yet, miraculously, the flames dissipated upon touching the ground.
Deng Qiuzhi observed the entire fight intently. Through gritted teeth, he muttered, "There's indeed a Purple Mansion cultivator overseeing this city! They're being really careful… even after holding our family hostage, they still send a Purple Mansion cultivator to watch over us! Are they truly afraid that we might rebel?"
As sword qi and spells clashed in the air, Chi Zhiyun's frustration mounted. It was evident to onlookers that his swordsmanship was no match for Li Chejing's. Fueled by anger, Chi Zhiyun unleashed a flurry of spells in an attempt to overpower Li Chejing.
Unperturbed, Li Chejing allowed Chi Zhiyun to unleash a barrage of techniques in their exchange. With his Qingche Sword, Li Chejing effortlessly countered every move with great ease, further asserting his superiority.
Observing the stunned onlookers below, Chi Zhiyun's anger surged. He reached for his storage pouch and summoned a pearl adorned with a pattern of hornless dragons. With both hands, he performed a series of hand seals, conjuring a crimson barrier.
Li Chejing merely cast a final glance at his opponent, then calmly sheathed his sword. He stood back and grinned.
"Senior Brother Chi!"
Chi Zhiyun hesitated, unsure whether to respond or not. But before he could react, Li Chejing stepped forward and continued with a laugh.
"Take this!"
Clang!
As soon as he finished speaking, a resounding clash of metal echoed throughout Yi Mountain City.
The collision was so great that Deng Qiuzhi's sword shook slightly at his waist, while the blades of grass across the city swayed erratically, trembling in response.
