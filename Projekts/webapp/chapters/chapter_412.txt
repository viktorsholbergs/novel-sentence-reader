Yi Mountain City was constructed around Mount Lingqiu, a once majestic and renowned peak. It used to blaze with flames in ancient times and produced a type of golden spirit ore mined extensively by an immortal sect known as the Southern Fire Heavenly Mansion. As a result of this, the earth veins became thinner, and the mountain eventually stopped burning.
At the highest cave dwelling atop the mountain, shrouded in clouds and swirling green fog, Daoist Master Yuan Su stood, playing with a light golden jade seal. He gazed down at the grand city below him.
"Buzi must have lost his mind… He wanders Wu and Yue States day and night, refusing to return to the sect. Thankfully, the devil plague is progressing well..." he murmured.
Daoist Master Yuan Su hailed from the same era as Chi Wei. Unfortunately, he practiced a cultivation method that prematurely ended his progress, confining him to the early stages of the Purple Mansion Realm. If not for the fact that it was a life divine ability, Yuan Su might have lost all standing.
Disillusioned, especially with people like Si Boxiu, he decided to choose a quieter life, hence retreating to the southern border.
"Hm?"
Yuan Su paused, sensing the surge of golden aura at the foot of the mountain.
"Someone's establishing a Dao foundation... it's the Engraved Stone…" he mumbled to himself.
He calculated silently; the one from Golden Tang Gate had not moved in ages but he still lived. If memory served, his divine ability was incomplete.
"Situ Huo practices the Engraved Stone, but that fool isn't skilled in alchemy and hasn't established his Dao Foundation… He's probably not destined for it."
Yuan Su chuckled to himself before picking up a jade token from the desk, muttering to himself, "Li Xuanfeng... another from the Li Family?"
The image of a certain young man flashed through his mind. As the jade token spun in his hand, Yuan Su mused, "I owe something to the Li Family... but who knows what that man thinks? Maybe Xiao Chuting has already beaten me to it. He probably detests the Chi Family and myself as well."
His other hand rose slowly, capturing a wisp of colorful light in the void. Unleashing his divine ability, he connected it across the heavens to Li Xuanfeng.
Yuan Su calculated carefully again with his divine ability.
It seems respect and fear prevail... Xiao Chuting doesn't dare make a move. Perhaps the Li Family only resents Chi Wei…
Back then, no outsiders knew who took Li Chejing away. When Yuan Su was forced to carry out this task, he was cautious enough to veil his face.
In terms of prudence, only Xiao Chuting can match me, he thought smugly.
Since the Li Family bore no malice toward him, Yuan Su decided to let the matter rest. With a flick of his fingers, he sent the jade token soaring like a shooting star, landing before a specific cave dwelling at the mountain's base.
"Damn it," Daoist Master Yuan Su cursed as he reattached the jade seal to his waist.
He settled back on the rock and muttered, "With Chi Wei dead, Yi Mountain City is mine… Who cares what the Chi Family thinks!"
In a brightly lit cave dwelling, a middle-aged man sat cross-legged beside a spirit spring, slowly exhaling.
His features were sharp, and he bore the visage of someone both brave and ruthless. Yet, a lingering sadness softened the harsh lines between his brows, tempering the fiery intensity within him that otherwise defined his presence.
Behind him stood his golden longbow, radiating an extraordinary aura.
He was none other than Li Xuanfeng.
"After more than fifty years of arduous cultivation, I've finally achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm!" he declared proudly, releasing a long breath and opening his eyes slowly. A golden fire danced within their depths. His eyes brightened momentarily before fading back to their natural hue.
As soon as Li Xuanfeng achieved his breakthrough, a few rays of light appeared behind him, and the name of Daoist Master Yuan Su surfaced in his thoughts. The Profound Pearl Talisman Seed within him stirred violently, emitting a white light that briefly clouded his vision before clarity returned.
However, this memory swiftly vanished, leaving Li Xuanfeng unaware of the internal struggle between the two forces within his mind.
My Immortal Foundation… The Engraved Stone!
This immortal foundation was established with cultivation techniques from the Golden Tang Gate. Its Qi was capable of breaking formations, cleaving mountains, and destroying enemies' dharma artifacts. Specializing in precision attacks, it becomes increasingly powerful with each enemy defeated, tempered by their blood qi.
Once formed, this Immortal Foundation could detect gold in earth veins, consume gold and jade for healing, ward off baleful qi, and render the body as impervious as metal and stone. With just a wave of his hand, he could wield sharp qi, making it difficult for spells and curses to harm him.
"It's an excellent tool for battle and breaking through formations," Li Xuanfeng mused as he rose to his feet. The Golden Age Longbow behind him vibrated and leaped into his hand instantly. He ran his fingers over the bowstring, only to notice that the cave wall was filled with brown and golden ores that seemed like spirit items.
"This is the phenomenon that accompanies the establishment of my foundation..." he mumbled quietly in awe.
The cave dwelling was brimming with baleful qi and astral qi. Thankfully, the grand formation of the Azure Pond Sect prevented the cave walls from being ravaged by the corrosive forces.
With a wave of his hand, Li Xuanfeng cleared the turbulent qi in the cave dwelling. Pushing open the door, he stepped out into the night. The stars and moon were shining brightly above in the sky.
The two Daoist children stationed keeping watch at the cave entrance exchanged surprised glances with each other, clearly not expecting that Li Xuanfeng—a mere clan cultivator—would succeed in establishing his foundation.
They quickly kneeled before him.
"Greetings, Old Ancestor! Congratulations on establishing your immortal foundation and ascending to immortality once again!"
Li Xuanfeng nodded and took a step forward, only to pause and look up as a fluorescent light streaked across the night sky.
Wrapped in a white glow and trailing a colorful tail three chi long, it slowly descended before him. Stunned, Li Xuanfeng watched as the light dimmed, transforming into a diamond-shaped jade pendant that landed at his feet.
Before he could speak, a tall figure appeared beside him, clad in the all-green attire and jade boots typical of an Azure Pond Sect disciple. Each item he wore glowed with the light of mana.
The Azure Pond Sect disciple slowly bowed, then sank to his knees gracefully and announced, "Hejing bears the imperial decree of the Daoist Master!"
After rising from his bow, an awkward smile spread across his face as he continued, "Please accept the decree, fellow Daoist!"
It must be Daoist Master Yuan Su…
Li Xuanfeng observed the man's reaction and understood that this was indeed an order from the esteemed Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Master.
That's quick!
Li Xuanfeng nodded slightly before accepting the decree with a smile. "Where is the Upper Sect sending this humble servant to?" he asked.
"You have humor, fellow Daoist. I am Ning Hejing, Peak Master of Yuanxing Peak, stationed in Yi Mountain City."
The smile on the man's face was stiff. Li Xuanfeng took a closer look at him before realization dawned upon him as well.
So, it's him!
This person was Senior Brother Ning who led a group of Yuanwu Peak disciples back then. He was tall and quite outstanding. He had kicked Deng Yuzhi over and let him shoot the fleeing cultivator with an arrow.
"Daoist Master Yuan Su has personally appointed you as a general, entrusting you with a significant responsibility," Ning Hejing quickly regained his composure and spoke with forced cheerfulness.
"This appointment is part of your entry into Yi Mountain City's cultivation registry. You'll receive immortal stipends and can also accumulate merits to request spirit items from the sect. From now on, you and I are colleagues," he explained.
Ning Hejing's eyelids twitched as incredulity flickered in his heart. He scanned Li Xuanfeng's face, pondering how this man, seemingly without notable background or talent—save for his archery skills, had been chosen for promotion.
How could Daoist Master Yuan Su personally promote a Foundation Establishment Realm clan cultivator when there are dozens of other cultivators of the same realm within the sect in this city? Is it out of admiration... or does he have other motives?
Li Xuanfeng raised his eyebrows, clearly pleased as he responded, "Thank you to the Daoist Master."
He did not dwell much on his situation. Since his arrival in Yi Mountain City, he had been resigned to a fate of death over dishonor, simply seeking to enhance his cultivation and extend his life a few more years. Now realizing he could still provide for his family in his remaining years, a thought struck him as he said with a smile, "How can I call myself your colleague? If the Peak Master has any requests, I am yours to command."
Ning Hejing studied Li Xuanfeng for a moment, clearly taken aback by his humble words despite his formidable prowess with the bow. Feeling somewhat reassured now, he replied warmly, "You are too polite, fellow Daoist. After all, you were personally promoted by Daoist Master Yuan Su… There's no need for formalities with Hejing. If you have any requests, just let me know."
Li Xuanfeng, though not particularly shrewd, had the wisdom of fifty years of experience. Since his family had no connections to Daoist Master Yuan Su, and suspecting that his promotion was more about Yuan Su's interests than his own merit, he said tactfully, "There's no need to trouble the Peak Master. I only wish to inquire about my duties."
"Nothing more than to help maintain order. The southern border is currently in chaos, and I have no interest in engaging in any cunning games."
Ning Hejing laughed, his demeanor turning eager as he warmly suggested, "Fellow Daoist Xuanfeng, why don't you come with me to meet all your colleagues?"
