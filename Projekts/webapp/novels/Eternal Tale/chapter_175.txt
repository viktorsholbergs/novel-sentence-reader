"Moo~" The big black ox let out a soft call, cleaning up the spilled tea. The teapot was now back on the table.
"Greetings, Ancestor!"
The two suddenly realized, and with a thud, they knelt down, prostrating themselves completely. This longevity had utterly shattered their imagination.
They couldn't fathom the level of this immortal's power, but he must be among the very highest.
"Back then, when I was down and out, Master Ning took me in without hesitation, making me half a member of the Ning family. I deserve to be called your ancestor." Chen Xun laughed heartily, accepting the title without reservation. Seeing the descendants of the Ning family reminded him of his master. "No need for such formalities, rise."
Now he finally understood why some elders were so protective of their juniors. He felt the same way—he would protect them too!
"Moo~" The big black ox was a bit excited, thinking about what gifts would be appropriate since they were being addressed as ancestors again.
"Thank you, Ancestor." The two stood up, their faces flushed with excitement.
"For our first meeting, these gifts are for you, the younger generation." Chen Xun sighed inwardly, enjoying this feeling. With a wave of his hand, he took out many items from his storage bag.
There were elixirs to prolong life, cure-all pills, and some rare medicinal herbs not found in the mortal world. These were items he had casually refined on his travels, originally intended to save suffering common folk and earn some merit.
"Ancestor, this..." The two were stunned by the generosity. These herbs must be at least a hundred years old.
"Old Ox, aren't you going to prepare something too?!" Chen Xun frowned and called out.
"Moo moo~!"
The big black ox bellowed at Chen Xun, who said he, Blac Ox, wasn't prepared?!
With a sweep of its hoof, the ground of the Ning family residence trembled slightly, and a formation rose up, hidden in the void, completely undetectable.
This was a simplified version of the Five Extremes Formation, capable of withstanding attacks from late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators and absorbing the energies of the five elements.
If the Ning family ever faced danger in the future, they could hide within it to avoid annihilation.
"Moo~" The big black ox placed a formation flag on the table.
"The Old Ox also learned alongside me under Master Ning; although not formally accepted as a disciple, Master and Mistress showed great kindness."
"Greetings, Ancestor Ox!"
The two called out loudly, bowing deeply, their voices trembling with excitement. It truly was heaven's blessing for the Ning family!
"Moo~~~!!"
The big black ox let out a long breath, its eyes wide with delight. This feeling was making it euphoric. It lifted a hoof, gently helping the two up, their eyes already reddening.
"This formation flag can protect the Ning family. The Old Ox has set up the formation in the residence, capable of warding off major disasters." Chen Xun looked more and more favorably at these two descendants, his smile deepening. "Lend me a drop of your blood essence. This item can only be used by the Ning family bloodline in the future."
"Thank you, Ancestor, for your generous gift! The Ning family will make good use of it." Ning Yuanru bowed, his eyes full of respect. Suddenly, both he and Ning Chongwan showed signs of pain as their blood essence was extracted.
A message was also transmitted directly into their minds, their eyes growing clearer, knowing how to use the formation flag.
"We will heed Ancestor's teachings," they said in unison, their eyes filled with deep reverence.
"Here are some medical texts, all teachings from Master Ning, including our own experiences." Chen Xun took out several booklets from his storage bag. "I hope you, the younger generation, can promote... no, advance medical skills to benefit the people."
The two kneeled before Chen Xun, solemnly receiving the booklets with teary eyes, feeling grateful beyond words.
"Master Ning once taught me that a healer must have a benevolent heart, but virtue is even more important." Chen Xun spoke firmly, "I hope the Ning family will not forget this principle. We will come back to check on you in the future. Don't disappoint me."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded heavily from the main seat, agreeing with his elder brother.
"We will heed the teachings of Ancestor and Ancestor Ox!"
The two kowtowed heavily, determined to pass down these words as family teachings.
When they looked up again, Chen Xun and the big black ox had already left, disappearing like the wind, silently.
"Big brother..." Ning Chongwan's eyes welled up with tears, feeling deeply moved.
"The two ancestors have only the best intentions for our Ning family." Ning Yuanru carefully gathered the items in the room. "Third Sister, prepare their portraits for the ancestral hall."
"Yes, big brother!" Ning Chongwan cried tears of joy as she ran out, shouting, "Someone, come quickly!"
Before long, the entire Ning family was bustling with activity, with many people rushing towards the Ning family's ancestral hall.
It was said that the immortal ancestor was protecting them. The entire old Ning family residence was as lively as during the New Year, with servants running everywhere and occasional loud shouts.
In the future, even the branches of the Ning family in the capital stopped vying for power. The Ning family in Panning City was deemed the ancestral lineage!
Every year during ancestor worship, Ning family members from all over gathered together, no matter how busy they were. Who dared not to attend?!
...
After Chen Xun and the big black ox left, they went to the Ning family's ancestral hall to pay their respects to their master and mistress, feeling greatly relieved.
They both had smiles on their faces, no longer feeling that sense of loss. Seeing the descendants of old friends made the departure of those friends seem less frightening.
Chen Xun felt great. These descendants were his own; there was no sense of unfamiliarity—they were all his children and grandchildren!
The big black ox felt the same way, happily wagging its tail along the way. After becoming an old Nascent Soul ancestor, not blessing the descendants of old friends would be pretentious!
They were walking on air, hidden in the clouds, heading towards a small mountain peak.
"Moo moo?" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun. There were no cultivators in the Ning family, only ordinary people.
"Old Ox, cultivating immortality is a matter of fate. Living a hundred years as a mortal is pretty good too." Chen Xun hummed a song, not intending to lead the Ning family into the path of immortal cultivation. "If someone in the Ning family seeks immortality, then they will have their fortune. Let's not impose it on them."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox nodded thoughtfully. Cultivating immortality was indeed too dangerous.
Immortal cultivation wars could break out at any time, and even fellow disciples could betray each other. While there might be intrigue in the mortal world, the chances of survival were much higher.
Chen Xun smiled at the contemplative big black ox, his gaze gradually shifting to the distance, where a small mountain peak came into view, quite desolate.
"Old Ox, we're here. Let's go see Old Sun."
"Moo!!"
The big black ox cried out excitedly. It had the deepest feelings for Old Sun and was finally going to see him again.
This nameless small mountain peak was deserted, overgrown with weeds, with no wildlife, only some startled birds.
"Old Ox, one of us on each side. Even if we have to dig up the whole mountain, we must find it!" Chen Xun shouted, flying to the other side.
"Moo!" The big black ox nodded heavily, stomping its hoof and diving into the mountain, starting to dig.
After a day and night, using their Nascent Soul cultivation, Chen Xun and the big black ox had almost turned the entire mountain upside down but found no trace.
"Damn it..." Chen Xun sat on the peak, punching the ground. His chest heaved slightly as he muttered curses.
Back then, without cultivation, he couldn't even preserve Old Sun's grave properly.
"Moo~~~~" A mournful ox cry echoed from the mountain, shaking the leaves from the trees.
"Old Ox, wait for me. I'll go to the city and buy this mountain!"
"Moo!"
The big black ox hadn't given up, searching everywhere, while Chen Xun flew away.
The next day, Chen Xun returned from the city with a land deed. This mountain was now theirs, officially stamped and sealed by the top official of Panning City!
As long as the Qian Nation existed, this land deed could be honored anywhere, bought with a lot of gold exchanged from precious herbs.
They stood in the sky. The big black ox, emotionally low, stomped its hoof, sealing the entire small mountain peak.
**Rumble!**
The small mountain shook. Chen Xun's eyelid twitched slightly, recalling the majestic mountains of Southern Dipper Mountain. Now the big black ox could also seal a mountain with a wave of its hand.
Chen Xun's gaze focused on his spiritual power gathering. A giant stele made of crane spirit wood descended from the sky, embedding halfway into the mountain. It stood atop the peak, with the inscription "Old Sun Mountain" on it.
"Moo?!!"
"Heh, I prepared this on my way back from the city, as Old Sun's resting place." Chen Xun sneered, patting the big black ox. "If anyone dares to mess with this mountain, even the heavens won't protect them!"
"Moo!" The big black ox's eyes flashed coldly. This mountain was legally purchased by its big brother. No one should dare touch it.
At that moment, a strong wind blew. Chen Xun silently withdrew his protective shield. He quite liked the feeling of a strong wind, reminiscent of the past.
They lingered for a long time, finally leaving with a sigh, disappearing into Yongquan Prefecture as two beams of light.
Although there were many regrets on their journey, seeing the Ning family descendants brought them great joy, making the trip worthwhile.
