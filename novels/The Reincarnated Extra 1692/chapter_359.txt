(Cursed Child) I Took a Short Nap
* * *
“Hey, Emi! What are you doing!?”
Suddenly being yelled at, I reflexively turned around, and there was Grandma Numbri.
This is a small flower garden.
A warm and quiet place behind Grandma’s shop.
“Weeding.”
“Weeding… ah, I see… you were helping me, weren’t you? Thank you… Sorry for shouting at you.”
Grandma sighed, looking at the pile of small blue flowers next to me, where I was crouching.
“…Weren’t these weeds?”
“Hmm… well, how should I put it… they’re growing wild, so I guess they’re weeds. But Emi… could you leave the rest of the blue flowers alone?”
Grandma chuckled wryly, bending down and patting my head.
“Why?”
“Hmm…”
Grandma, placing her hand on her chin, thought for a moment before answering my question.
“It’s a maiden’s secret!”
She grinned.
“What are you talking about, old woman?”
“Oh, you’re saying that? No dinner for you.”
* * *
“…Mmm.”
I opened my eyes.
What filled my vision was the night sky of the city, with few stars visible.
I could feel the hard, cold cobblestones against my back.
This isn’t the flower garden.
“…………”
And when I sat up, I saw a plaza riddled with holes, illuminated by streetlights.
The reason why it’s full of holes is because I was fighting here just now.
Yeah.
This isn’t the flower garden.
That was a dream.
A memory from a little while ago.
Because Grandma.
Is gone.
<Good morning, Emi. Is your body okay?>
Good morning.
Right, there’s no need to worry, Extra-sama.
After exchanging a few words, I stood up and moved my body a bit.
Swinging my arms and legs, rotating my neck, circling my shoulders and hips.
I’m tired, but I can move without any problems.
No pain.
The bleeding has stopped.
<I thought you broke a few bones…>
They seem to have healed.
I fell asleep for a bit.
Maybe that accelerated my recovery?
I looked around while talking to Extra-sama.
There’s no one in the plaza now.
I’m the only one alive.
That mysterious werewolf who appeared before I fell asleep is also gone.
“Phew.”
I couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief.
That was close.
If I had been attacked in the state I was in before I fell asleep, I would have been in trouble.
I was really lucky this time.
<I was scared to death during that battle. Hey, Emi, please don’t do anything reckless like that again, okay?>
Hahaha, sorry, sorry, Extra-sama.
<Seriously… but I never imagined we’d have to fight a cult after the Demon Lord’s army.>
It was a surprise, wasn’t it?
Well, I was able to rampage quite a bit, so I’m happy about that.
<What are you saying! Your life was in danger!? If you want to rampage, please rampage more safely!>
What the hell is “rampage more safely”!?
<Um… like, massacring defenseless ordinary citizens…?>
It’s not “massacring defenseless ordinary citizens…”, okay!?
My family… or rather, my mind roommate’s ideas are too evil!!
As usual, Extra-sama has no sense of ethics…
<You’re one to talk.>
Whatーーー!?
Well, from there, it’s a back-and-forth, a quarrel, right?
But of course, it’s not a serious fight.
Because when I look around, all I see is rubble.
And the mangled corpses of my enemies.
…And even seeing that, I don’t feel anything.
Extra-sama has a point.
“You’re one to talk.”
That’s certainly true.
* * *
“Alright.”
Now then, after that, I gathered the corpses of my enemies and lined them up.
It’s a small act of kindness.
Usually, I’d make a grave and bury them, but it’s in the middle of town.
I’ll leave them as they are for now.
And after offering a silent prayer with my hands together… I turned my back on them and started walking.
Out of the plaza, down the main street… heading east.
<…Are you sure you’ve rested enough?>
Extra-sama asked, worried.
I’m fine, I’m fine.
No problem.
<Really?>
I’m telling you!
Ah, well… I’m still tired, but.
Think about it, Extra-sama.
What’s my current goal?
<To continue east and deliver flowers to Mihabyushira Hill, right?>
That’s right.
I’m not going hunting or fighting enemies… I don’t have any rough stuff planned.
So wouldn’t it be fine even if I’m a little tired?
I said that and took out the bouquet of blue flowers from my bag, checking its condition.
…It’s a bit crushed.
That damn gravity manipulation attack.
But even though it’s damaged, it’s still in the shape of a bouquet.
Good, good.
<Well, anyway, don’t push yourself, okay?>
Yeah, yeah.
I gave a half-hearted reply to the worrisome Extra-sama and put the bouquet back in my bag.
And then, I turned to face forward.
The silhouette of a small hill visible at the end of the main street was gradually getting bigger.
That’s Mihabyushira Hill.
The place I promised Grandma to go to.
Watch me, Grandma.
I’ll properly carry out your “mischief”.
Second stage, concluded!
Even Emi is quite exhausted this time.
But the battle continues!
From the , we enter the third stage.
Hang in there, Emi!
