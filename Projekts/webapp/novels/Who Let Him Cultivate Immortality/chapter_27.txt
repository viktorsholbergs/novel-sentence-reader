Chapter 27: Breakthrough at Hundred Fragrances Pavilion
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
The royal family and the Meng family had a close relationship, often intermarrying. The Meng family continuously produced prodigies, and whenever people thought the family’s heritage was exhausted and the descendants were too weak to support the Meng name, a genius would emerge, upholding the Meng family’s immortal legend. Thus, rumors said that the Meng family had linked their family’s fate with the destiny of the Great Xia Dynasty; as long as the dynasty existed, the Meng family would never perish.
“It’s not that exaggerated,” Meng Jingzhou laughed heartily, modestly saying, “I didn’t expect you to guess that I am the once-in-a-generation genius of the Meng family.”
“…No, we didn’t think you were a genius,” Lu Yang spoke the truth. A non-serious Meng Jingzhou supporting the Meng family’s great responsibilities seemed like it would mark the end of the Meng family’s immortal legend.
If there was a genius, it was more fitting for Lu Yang, who was destined to shoulder the great responsibilities of the Dao Seeking Sect in the future.
The two praised themselves and belittled each other, completely forgetting about Peach Blossom Leaf beside them, whose talent as a Feathery Immortal Body surpassed both single spiritual roots and sword spiritual roots.
Fortunately, they didn’t dwell on this topic for too long. A powerful and wild aura suddenly spread from downstairs, shaking the entire Hundred Fragrances Pavilion. If the building hadn’t been sturdy, the aura alone could have collapsed the structure!
Lu Yang and the others felt as if their heads were struck by a heavy hammer, their minds went blank, and their internal organs felt like they were being squeezed together — an extremely uncomfortable sensation.
Others in the vicinity with higher cultivation levels than Lu Yang’s group, including some in the Golden Core phase, fared slightly better but not by much.
“Is someone breaking through to the Nascent Soul phase?!” a Nascent Soul phase sister exclaimed in surprise, sensing a hint of primitive wildness in the aura.
The dishes in Hundred Fragrances Pavilion were not just delicious; they could increase cultivation levels or even help a cultivation technique circulate for several more cycles. If combined correctly, the food could enhance their effects.
“I’ve heard that one can break through an entire realm just by having a meal here, but I thought it was just a rumor. Today, I see it’s true!”
“Who knows which lucky junior brother or sister is breaking through here.”
Normally, people breaking through would seek a quiet place, closed off and protected. Hundred Fragrances Pavilion, with its noisy and chaotic environment, was not conducive to breakthroughs. Managing a breakthrough in such a setting demonstrated how greatly Hundred Fragrances Pavilion’s food could enhance cultivation!
The waiter gently pressed down, and the pressure from the Nascent Soul phase immediately disappeared. Everyone caught their breath, then looked at the waiter in astonishment.
To them, the waiter was only at the Golden Core phase, but his casual display of power clearly surpassed that level. His true cultivation level was disguised.
Someone whispered to their companion, “I heard from an elder that when Hundred Fragrances Pavilion first opened a thousand years ago, he was already the waiter. A thousand years have passed, and he still looks the same.”
It’s common for cultivators’ appearances to remain unchanged, but staying exactly the same for a thousand years was exceedingly rare.
The waiter, as if he hadn’t heard the whispers, apologized with a smile, “I’m sorry, it seems one of our guests got too excited during their breakthrough and forgot to restrain their aura. Please excuse us.”
A junior brother who had just entered the Golden Core phase, reminiscing the aura of the breakthrough, brightened up, “This aura has a hint of wildness, like the ancient dragon race reborn. It must be a body cultivator brother who has broken through. Let’s seize this opportunity to comprehend this aura; it might greatly help in strengthening our physiques!”
“Indeed, indeed. This serendipitous chance is our opportunity; we should grasp it.” His companions agreed, and they all began to meditate.
Floating slightly in the air, they closed their eyes in silence, feeling the cool and refreshing qi coming from all directions, making them exceptionally comfortable.
Even though they were not body cultivators, cultivators still greatly valued physical strength. With sufficient magic power, but a weak body, one could easily fall victim to sneak attacks and be killed in one hit. Or, if an opponent engaged in close combat, one could die upon approach, without even the chance to escape or counterattack. Therefore, the Dao Seeking Sect placed great emphasis on the physical fitness of its disciples.
The ancient dragon race, known among beasts for summoning storms and possessing invincible physical bodies, was one of the top clans, ruling the domain of beasts. Comprehending even a trace of the ancient dragon’s qi could greatly benefit one’s physique, and if one could comprehend and adapt a skill or two of the dragon race’s divine powers, it would be an incredibly fortunate opportunity!
Five Golden Core cultivators, surrounded by steamy food, chose to meditate instead. This scene was indeed a rarity.
Such sensitivity to opportunity greatly impressed Lu Yang.
“Shall we also seize this opportunity to meditate and see if we can perceive the wild aura of the ancient dragon race?” Peach Blossom Leaf suggested.
Lu Yang was surprised, “Can you feel the ancient dragon qi that the senior brothers mentioned?”
“Let’s try; there’s no loss in trying.”
Just as Lu Yang and his companions were considering whether to meditate and try to comprehend the wild aura of the ancient dragon race, hurried footsteps sounded from the staircase.
A fierce, fanged wild boar appeared, its eyes filled with panic and rage, instilling a deep sense of crisis in everyone.
Such a ferocious and terrifying beast, its realm surpassing most of those present! And its aura was unstable, as if it had just broken through!
The waiter frowned, and as he was considering whether to take action himself, a bright blade flashed, and a piercing blade aura, intense and scorching, slashed down. The wild boar was beheaded in one stroke, its head rolling far away, coming to a stop at Lu Yang’s feet.
The boar’s eyes stared at Lu Yang, dying with grievances unredressed.
What should have been a bloody scene was bloodless. The intense heat from the blade instantly cooked the severed area, emitting an aroma of roasted meat.
The owner of the blade finally appeared. He was a common-looking chef, wearing a tall hat and a special apron, holding a pig-slaughtering knife, his face covered with coarse features, smiling like a bandit ready to commit a robbery.
“Sorry, sorry, I didn’t mean to startle everyone. I was about to slaughter this dragon-blood wild boar. Perhaps it was my intense killing intent that caused the beast to feel a life-and-death crisis, activating the ancient dragon blood in it, and breaking through to the Nascent Soul phase.”
“This was an oversight on our part; it won’t happen again. Please understand!”
The chef, holding the pig-slaughtering knife and grinning fiercely, sounded genuinely sincere. The patrons felt they had no choice but to accept his apology.
The chef picked up the boar’s head from Lu Yang’s feet, reattached it to the body, and the oppressive atmosphere finally dissipated.
The five Golden Core cultivators felt a bit embarrassed, unsure whether to continue meditating or not.
One of them slammed the table, “Damn it, bring a pot of pig-killing vegetables, made from that boar!”
The meat of a Nascent Soul phase boar, especially one with ancient dragon lineage, was extremely pricey. The pot of pig-killing vegetables they were about to consume would be worth waking up from a dream and slapping oneself twice for.
Even if it meant slapping themselves, they were determined to eat this Nascent Soul phase wild boar. They couldn’t let their indignation and frustration turn into internal injuries.
The waiter casually slung a towel over his shoulder, smiling as he shouted, “Alright, add a pot of pig-killing vegetables for our five guests!”
TL Note: The image here is pig-killing vegetables. There’s not really a good translation for it in english. A direct translation would be Kill Pig Cuisine.
