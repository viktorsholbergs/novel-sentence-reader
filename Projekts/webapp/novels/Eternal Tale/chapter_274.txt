Above the Western Sea, several islands trembled lightly. Numerous spirit beasts on them mirrored Little Red's terrified posture, crouching and shivering.
They instantly appeared on an island. The big black ox's gaze sharpened as it waved its formation flag and swiftly departed.
Chen Xun formed two fingers before his chest, radiating five-element divine light to withstand the immense pressure from rapid teleportation.
The suspended heavenly barrier had unknowingly closed. They couldn’t afford mishaps and pressed forward urgently.
Buzz… Buzz…
The islands echoed with a deafening hum, stirring massive waves along the coast. The oppressive aura intensified as Little Red panted heavily, its Nascent Soul suppressed to the brink.
“Moo!” The big black ox roared, kicking up clouds of dust. They reached the Western Sea’s final stop.
“Old ox, head for the Forbidden Sea!” Chen Xun commanded coldly, the surrounding formations surging with power, far stronger than before. “Move out.”
“Moo~” The big black ox nodded solemnly, leaving Little Red behind.
A beam of light shot skyward, shaking the ground. Furious roars erupted from the island's spirit beasts, protecting their territory. Yet, upon seeing the two figures, their eyes shrank in fear, retreating quietly while munching on grass—brotherly courtesy.
Once the duo vanished, the Five-Element Formation cloaked the teleportation array. The beasts, feeling a newfound relief, shook themselves and regained composure.
The sky darkened, the sea dimmed—they entered the Forbidden Sea’s demon lair once again.
The desolate mine still stood; these islands were far from accessible to ordinary cultivators, hidden with incredible secrecy.
Exhausted from consecutive teleportation, Little Red marveled at the duo’s overwhelming might. What arcane arts did they cultivate to suppress both Nascent Souls and spiritual energy?
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged glances, retrieving an ancient War Camp Command Token from their storage rings.
The token vibrated intensely, guiding them to the demon lair’s depths.
“Go.”
“Moo~”
“Brother Xun, Brother Ox, I, Beigong Red Lion, will—” Little Red’s words were cut off as the teleportation array activated, leaving only a mournful echo behind.
It felt like a lifetime ago when they returned to that barren, lifeless island, shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere. Their bandit outfits now cloaked them fully.
Chen Xun and the big black ox soared toward the coast, with Little Red struggling to follow.
Standing above the black sea, they raised a hand. Little Red watched intently from the shore, awestruck by his two brothers.
Rumble! Rumble!
A colossal shadow emerged between their hands, its intricate runes glowing vividly. The surrounding five-element energy surged toward it.
The calm black sea churned violently as if some monstrous entity were awakening.
A peculiar tree with shimmering black-and-white branches began materializing from the shadow, radiating brilliance, seemingly coming alive.
Chen Xun and the big black ox exuded divine light. A massive boat crashed into the black sea with a thunderous roar.
“Brothers, board the ship. We’re breaching the heavenly barrier!”
“Moo!”
“Coming, Brother Xun!!”
Little Red eagerly cheered, loving the feeling of being shielded by the big black ox.
Buzz! Buzz!
A deep acceleration sound shattered the long silence as the big black ox stamped its hooves. Five-element power surged forth, blending seamlessly with the formation flag to steer the massive ship.
The Crane Spirit Five-Element Tree emitted crackling sounds, its radiance complementing the ox’s formation.
The giant boat sped forward, slicing through waves and covering vast distances in moments.
Three days later.
Chen Xun and the big black ox stood at the bow, gazing solemnly at the horizon.
The purple-golden barrier that spanned the heavens remained sealed, seemingly independent of the suspended heavenly barrier.
“Damn it,” Chen Xun cursed under his breath. They’d waited so long, yet trouble persisted.
“Moo~” The big black ox reassured him, sensing a connection to the Four Immortal Mountains across the sea. This was a formation.
Chen Xun nodded slightly, relying on the big black ox’s expertise.
Little Red stood silently on the deck, staring at his two brothers with reverence.
“Moo!!”
The big black ox let out a deafening roar, shaking the seas. Lightning surged across the ocean, mist rising everywhere.
It raised the War Camp Command Token, infusing it with five-element power. The token thundered as it shot toward the barrier.
With blazing eyes, the big black ox formed seals, directing the token like a blood-red arrow toward the barrier’s weak point.
This was the key to breaking the formation!
Boom! Boom! Boom!
As the token struck, a flaw appeared. Light flooded the area as the big black ox soared, unleashing divine radiance. A massive array wheel emerged with a hum.
A fierce wind roared as a terrifying shadow appeared behind the big black ox. The raging five-element energy shook the heavens.
“Moo!!”
An ancient roar echoed as four massive hooves stepped out from the shadow.
Gradually, ox heads materialized, cold and imposing, exuding overwhelming pressure. The shadow expanded, standing like a titan opposite the purple-golden barrier.
At the center of the shadowy figure, five radiant flowers swayed like divine lotuses, absorbing the five-elemental energies of heaven and earth.
The boundless energy cascaded like grains of sand, flooding into the shadow. The black sea roiled, its waves fierce and untamed.
A five-headed, ten-armed apparition!
“Brother ox, what… what is that?!” Little Red exclaimed, foaming at the mouth before fainting, overwhelmed by the unimaginable sight and crushing pressure.
At the bow of the colossal ship, the big black ox stood supreme, its shadowy figure extending ten arms, pushing the War Camp Command Token forward with immense power.
The surrounding space was engulfed in a massive formation, with the ox itself as the core, turning into a one-ox formation to exploit the ancient array’s weakness!
“Ximen Black Ox... incredible,” Chen Xun muttered, momentarily stunned before shouting, “Old ox, go for it!”
“Moo! Moo!”
The big black ox’s gaze was icy, its hoof sweeping the formation flag as it charged at the ancient formation, executing the Five-Element Barrier-Breaking Art!
The blood-red token activated completely, causing the ancient array to tremble and burst forth with blinding purple-golden light.
The void twisted around them, thunderous booms filling the air, waves crashing endlessly. The sky above began to crack.
A golden beam pierced the heavens, illuminating the black sea. For the first time in eons, light broke through the darkened skies.
The invincible ancient array was forcibly breached by the big black ox, creating a path!
“Holy... crap...”
Chen Xun stared, dumbfounded, at the dazzling light and the big black ox’s imposing figure. “No wonder you’re my brother. Impressive…”
“Moo~~~” The big black ox exhaled proudly and turned to smile at Chen Xun.
“Legendary!”
“Moo!”
The big black ox trembled with excitement at the praise, quickly retreating to the ship's bow and nudging Chen Xun. The terrifying shadow behind it remained but dimmed its aura.
Chen Xun laughed heartily, slapping the ox’s shoulder before turning to face the icy, ominous road ahead.
“Brothers, let’s move. Onward to the battlefield—kill the corrupted ones!”
“Moo~”
“Alright... Brother Xun...” Little Red weakly opened his eyes, trembling. “Brother ox... you’re amazing!”
“Moo~” The big black ox gave Little Red a reassuring glance. Big Brother hadn’t even acted yet.
Buzz!
The ship sped across the turbulent sea. Ahead, the black sea grew calm, and the token returned to the ox, silent now that the path was open.
A chilling, ominous aura poured from the passage, assaulting their spirits, bodies, and wills, more terrifying than the Forbidden Sea’s remnants.
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged a grave look—and smirked.
An incense stick’s time later, the ship fully entered the golden passage. Their smuggling plan had succeeded, but Chen Xun felt no joy.
Darkness. Endless darkness. The passage held no light, no signs of life, only deathly cold. Its destination was unknown.
The big black ox, following their escape plan, meticulously set up formations aboard the ship. They left no room for chance, avoiding all gambles.
Chen Xun crossed his arms as three ancient axes, aged 280,000 years, appeared behind him. A fearsome shadow began to take shape at his back.
The big black ox stepped forward, a massive black coffin appearing on its back. Waves of death energy surged, repelling the oppressive cold from all sides.
Together, Chen Xun and the big black ox raised their hands to the sky. Their black robes fluttered in the still air as an overwhelming pressure erupted from the passage.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Crimson light pierced the darkness. Chen Xun’s hair danced wildly as massive, blazing five-element wheels materialized around them. The big black ox summoned the same, surrounding them in a hundred glowing wheels.
Within each wheel, searing meteors began to emerge, their chaotic energy drawing torrents of five-elemental power from the heavens like rivers.
This was Chen Xun’s masterpiece, Starfall Art!
“Brother Xun, I… I can’t…” Little Red stammered, trembling at the sight of the crimson glow and the towering shadows behind his brothers. Overwhelmed, he fainted again.
At that moment, the Crane Spirit Five-Element Tree erupted with divine brilliance, pouring its power into the ship. A heavy force propelled the vessel forward at even greater speed.
Boom!
The ship thundered as it accelerated, plunging deeper into the passage. None in the realms could have foreseen that the most fearsome beings of their world were smuggling themselves in.
On this day, the corrupted ones in the domain battlefield remembered the terror of being dominated by the immortals. Two harbingers of doom were on their way, and war was imminent!
