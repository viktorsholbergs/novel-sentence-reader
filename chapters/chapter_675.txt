Just as Chen Yang finished speaking, he heard the rustling sound of Li Zhouwei lifting the curtain behind him, followed by the heir’s cold reply, "They are all doomed men. No need to bother with them."
Chen Yang raised an eyebrow slightly. His mind turned and quickly grasped the meaning. He replied with a smile, "Understood."
Li Zhouwei stepped out of the carriage, silently gazing at the grand city before him. He walked into the lavish yet aging main hall and stopped beside the towering throne.
He tapped his brocade boots twice against the floor, then stepped up beside the throne. He casually glanced around before turning back and said, "None of the twenty-one esteemed families in this city are innocent. Kill them all. Distribute their wealth to our forces and recruit a batch of men first."
Chen Yang nodded, but Li Zhouwei stared at him for a moment, thinking to himself, Father said this man is cunning and bold but lacks the ability to command true loyalty. If I let him go alone, resentment may rise and he might stir up a mutinous force.
Feeling uneasy about Chen Yang, Li Zhouwei took the halberd from the carriage and donned his armor. He shook out the robe behind him, mounted his horse, and said with a frown, "You will come with me."
Chen Yang mounted his horse and followed behind Li Zhouwei. Li Zhouwei pulled out a roster and selected a family with many followers but in a weakened state. Gripping the reins of his spirit horse, he called out loudly, "To the Dili Family!"
The city’s roads were uneven and full of potholes, but his heavy-set Zhongsuo spirit horse moved as if on flat ground and swiftly galloped out of the city.
In less than fifteen minutes, he reached a large village near the city’s edge. From afar, he could see people moving in and out. He reined in his horse, waiting for the guards to catch up before pulling his reins tighter and gazing toward the settlement.
Barbarians must be ruled by barbarians. To control them, one must have trusted subordinates with many followers. Yet those born into lowly and impoverished backgrounds should serve as the blade.
Dili Family Village.
Dili Youjie had spent the entire night in anxiety. Early in the morning, he was already pacing anxiously in front of the village. The bow and beast bones at his waist clang noisily, revealing his unease.
His Dili Family had cultivated this land for years, boasting a large population and many warriors. Yet they lacked enough shamans. This branded them as an inferior caste, forcing them to settle outside the city and provide a steady supply of sacrifices to Fu Daimu.
When this land later fell under Fei Luoya's rule, years of chaotic mismanagement caused the Dili Family to miss their opportunity for advancement. Leaving them as lowly outcasts again. However, after the transition to the Li Family, life improved significantly.
The reason was simple. Previously, the Li Family had little direct control over Great Jueting. Since most of Fei Luoya’s subordinates had settled here, the Li Family refrained from interfering too much. They were merely sending officials to survey and allocate spirit fields. It was more of a vassalage than actual rule.
But this morning, upon hearing that Li Family’s troops had entered the city, Dili Youjie found himself unable to gain an audience. Aside from growing restless within the village, he was truly at a loss for what to do.
Clop! Clop! Clop!
As the long-haired warrior was lost in thought, a sudden roar of thunderous sounds jolted him awake. As someone who had wielded strong bows and ridden fierce horses among the Mount Yue people, how could he not recognize that sound? He stiffened slightly, his expression turning to alarm. He muttered, "Cavalry?"
He abruptly lifted his head, hastily unfastening a horn from his waist. But before he could sound it, a deafening boom rang out. Above the ten-foot-tall village gate, a dark shadow soared through the sky, blocking out the blazing sun and casting a writhing silhouette below.
Dili Youjie caught a fleeting glimpse of a gleaming halberd slicing through the air. The blackened-gray armor made a harsh metallic sound and gleamed with an iron sheen of a quality Mount Yue had been unable to forge for generations.
Hsshhh…
As the hooves landed, sand and dust burst into the air, mingling with the chaotic snorts and neighs of the spirit horse. The people within the Dili village stared in shock, their minds momentarily blank. Even Dili Youjie who was usually resolute, unconsciously took a step back and his stern face turned pale.
Clang!
The halberd struck the ground, gleaming coldly through the dust. Before he could see the man clearly, a deafening clash of metal rang out. The village gate was torn to shreds. Armored eastern soldiers that were disciplined and orderly, flowed in like a relentless tide.
A few members of the Dili Family attempted resistance, but they were as helpless as lambs before these men and were subdued in mere moments. Dili Youjie immediately recognized them as the Li Family’s troops and dared not resist. He clenched his fists as he stood frozen in place.
"Ugh…"
With a heavy thud, Dili Youjie was pressed to the ground by several jade-armored soldiers. Amid the clanking of metal, cold blades pressed tightly against his neck. Their gleaming edges were sharp and menacing. More than a dozen iron spears encircled him, leaving him utterly immobilized.
In mere moments, the entire Dili Family was under control. Kneeling on the ground with disheveled hair, Dili Youjie dared not move an inch. He felt an icy chill creeping over his body.
The scorching sunlight cast a golden glow before him. Beads of sweat that were the size of soybeans dripped steadily onto the ground. Adjusting his posture slowly, Dili Youjie raised his head and met a pair of narrow eyes tinged with a faint golden hue.
The young man gave him a casual glance before surveying the surroundings, seemingly assessing the number of men present. Then, he lifted the silk document in his hand and read aloud, "Dili… Youjie?"
The voice was calm, carrying the clarity of youth. Dili Youjie, one of the most skilled hunters among the families within five kilometers and a young leader feared by many, found himself unable to meet the youth’s gaze. Hoarsely, he replied, "I pay my respects to the immortal family… My lord."
Sweat poured down his face as that gaze forced him to lower his head. With cold steel pressed against his throat, he did not dare to move. From behind, another man dismounted from his spirit horse. His expression was icy as he circled around Dili Youjie.
With long brows and gray-black eyes, the man studied Dili Youjie with an indifferent gaze, as if weighing his worth like that of a mere livestock. In a low voice, the man asked, "Your Highness… Is this man worth using?"
The youth on horseback did not answer immediately. Instead, he chuckled and asked, "Dili Youjie, the letter says you are young and capable. I am offering you an overwhelming fortune, will you take it?"
Dili Youjie had always been decisive, but never had his mind felt so clear. In a flash, he pieced everything together and responded with a trembling voice, "I give my thanks to the heir!"
Finally, he gathered the courage to meet those eyes. The eyes that were seemingly born to manipulate hearts. A dark golden hue flowed within them, sending a chill down his legs.
As Dili Youjie listened, the youth tugged his reins and the iron hooves struck the ground rhythmically. With a flick of his whip, he nudged aside the cold blade at his throat and said with amusement, "Gather your Dili Family. Ride into the city and kill!"
