Seeing Li Qiuyang step forward to receive the bottle with both hands, Li Tongya advised once more, "You failed to break through and damaged your body… This talisman water was condensed from my own immortal foundation and cannot be stored for long. Take it twice a day for three days, meditate carefully, and perhaps you can recover a little."
"Thank you, Clan Uncle!" Li Qiuyang thanked him gratefully as he accepted the bottle and bowed deeply.
Li Tongya then asked with a smile, "I heard that you took a kid from the Chen Family as your disciple… It has been several years now. How is he?"
Li Qiuyang nodded.
"His name is Chen Mufeng, a member of the Chen Family, from the same lineage as Donghe. His talent is remarkable… even better than mine! He is now twelve years old and has just reached the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."
Li Tongya raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised by this revelation. "He is indeed promising. You have taught him well!" he praised.
Li Qiuyang repeatedly shook his head and answered, "The boy is a hard worker. Donghe's lineage has always been remarkable! I suspect his ancestors were not ordinary men at all."
Li Tongya made a mental note of this before dismissing Li Qiuyang. He sheathed his long sword and then flew toward Mount Dali.
He traveled along the mountain paths he was familiar with, until he reached a cliff. A large banyan tree with pale leaves stood on the slope, its white leaves drifting to the ground. It covered the area with a beautiful dappled white pattern.
As expected, a large red fox was sleeping under the tree. The moment Li Tongya landed, the fox's ears pricked up instantly, squinting warily before lying back down lazily.
"Chi Wei is dead! Even his metallic essence was taken away… The Emissaries of Death specially brought a dharma artifact just to capture his metallic essence," it squeaked.
"Metallic essence?" Li Tongya asked quietly. He had heard rumors before that the metallic essence was the key to forming the Golden Core, the source of the mysticism of the Golden Core Realm cultivators, often transforming into various divine objects.
However, he was unfamiliar with the Emissaries of Death, and his curiosity was very much piqued.
"Who are the Emissaries of Death…?" he asked.
The fox flicked its tail before shooting a fleeting glance at Li Tongya, and it was about to respond when it suddenly jumped up, its eyes wide with surprise. It exclaimed loudly, "You… you broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm!"
Li Tongya nodded lightly, and the fox's expression immediately drooped. It rolled on the ground, grumbling, "Aaaaaah, how annoying! I am still stuck between the sixth and seventh heavenly layers of the Qi Cultivation Realm, while you have already reached the Foundation Establishment Realm… It is frustrating!"
The fox was quite blunt, saying whatever was on its mind, which brought a smile to Li Tongya's face. The fox eventually sighed weakly, "I don't know all that much… I was only repeating what I heard the demons above me say."
Then, it lifted its head, sniffing at Li Tongya before grinding its teeth.
"What kind of immortal foundation did you cultivate?"
Li Tongya paused briefly and replied gently, "Boundless Ocean."
"Boundless Ocean…?"
The fox cocked its head in confusion and stroked its whiskers for a moment, when suddenly its eyes widened as big as saucers, as if hit by sudden realization.
"It's the Jing Dragon King!"
"Jing Dragon King...?" Li Tongya repeated. Now it was his turn to be puzzled.
The fox chuckled and explained, "Is it the immortal foundation that grants the ability to predict droughts and floods by studying water channels, enter the water without disturbing crabs or fish, and has the ability to create talisman water?"
"It is!" Li Tongya confirmed. Initially, he had intended to keep it a secret, but he noticed that this fox was already well-informed, so he cupped his fist and simply admitted it.
The fox continued with a smile, "In ancient times, this immortal foundation was called the Jing Dragon King, often formed by snake and dragon demons… That is how it got its name, and it is said to be a good one."
It paused for a moment, smiling as it took the Spirit Rice handed over by Li Tongya, then added, "There was once a Foundation Establishment Realm rogue cultivator who practiced the Jing Dragon King in the northern foothills of Mount Dali… He came into the mountains a few times to slay demons, but he lacked insight and offended several demon generals. Hence, they chased him away. I saw that battle myself and have been keeping an eye on this immortal foundation ever since, so I know a bit more about it."
Li Tongya nodded in comprehension. The fox rolled over to find a comfortable position to lie down and asked, "So, what orders does this esteemed Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator have for me today?"
Seeing the teasing expression on the fox's face, Li Tongya knew it was joking and replied, "I would not dare give orders… but do you know where to find valuable medicinal herbs in the mountains, my friend?"
"Medicinal herbs..? Most are already claimed, though some might still remain hidden…" it mumbled.
The fox raised its head, waving its paw. "But if I knew where to find them, would I leave them for you? I would have already eaten them to improve my cultivation. These herbs in the mountains are like the Spirit Paddies you cultivators plant. Each one is recorded in the demon den's ledger, carefully monitored by demons, and immediately taken away when ready. It is best not to covet them! If you were a rogue cultivator, you could steal them and run away. However, considering your family lives at the foot of the mountain, offending the demon den would not be wise."
Li Tongya nodded lightly and expressed his thanks for this information. After thinking for a few moments, he asked, "If there is nothing to find in the mountains, do you know where else I could seek these medicinal herbs? A senior of mine has made a breakthrough, and we are closely connected to his family. We rely on them, so we are obliged to offer a respectable gift."
The fox swayed its tail and pointed its paw toward Mount Yue, replying, "Right now, the only place left to search is within the territory of Mount Yue. There are just a few Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators over there. As long as you carefully navigate around them, you will find that Mount Yue does not specialize in farming. Much of the land is dense forest, and if you search diligently for a few years, you will likely have made some valuable findings."
"Thank you, my friend!" Li Tongya nodded as he sighed inwardly, already formulating a plan as he thought to himself, In just three months, how could I expect to find something so easily? I'll still have to spend this money after all! Hmm… I'll first check out Mount Yue territory, and then visit the surrounding markets.
The fox's black, beady eyes darted around as it asked tentatively, "What kind of gift requires valuable medicinal herbs? Is it for a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator? That senior of yours… could it be the new Daoist Master of the Xiao Family?"
Li Tongya had known this White Banyan Fox for decades, so after some brief contemplation, he decided to answer honestly.
"Yes, it is for that Daoist Master who has recently separated from Azure Pond Sect. Our family intends to forge an alliance with them."
The fox narrowed its eyes thoughtfully for a few moments before its expression changed. It exclaimed, "That Daoist Master cultivates a divine ability known as Man on Creek, and your Boundless Ocean is one of its Dao Partners… You must be careful not to consume any pills or herbs given by them. Do not follow in your younger brother's footsteps and become someone's supplement!"
The fox's concern was genuine, and Li Tongya nodded appreciatively, saying quietly, "The Xiao Family specifically brought up the topic of Dao Partners with me, intending to be transparent to avoid such suspicion. As for the pills…"
Li Tongya carefully recalled, and after digging through distant memories, he spoke with a serious expression, "I only received one medicine powder from the Daoist Master back when I was in the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm… That was the only instance, so it shouldn't be a concern."
"Make sure you stay aware is all."
The fox lowered its head and gloomily counted the Spirit Rice as it replied, "I came down from the demon den and do not have many friends in the mountains… There are plenty who want to eat me, though. I imagine your world is not much different. I have to protect myself, and you should avoid being eaten too. For at least a hundred years, you and I can still chat under this tree."
Li Tongya stared blankly at the fox for a moment before chuckling softly.
"Agreed."
