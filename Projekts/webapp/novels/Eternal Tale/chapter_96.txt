"Old Ox."
"Moo?"
"Did we forget something big?"
"Moo moo?"
"The grudge with the Cliff Eaglesâ€”how can we not settle it? Let's steal the egg and hit the road!"
"Moo~~!"
The big black ox suddenly got excited, shaking the ground, and causing maple leaves to scatter everywhere.
With a thunderous rise, the man and the ox revealed a cold smirk, simultaneously looking in one direction, scouting first before acting, adhering to the industry's rules.
...
Two months later, on a certain cliff, two dark figures emitted excited screams as they ran wildly while clutching a large egg.
In the sky above, two Qing Cliff Eagles were in a panic, emitting piercing screeches that pierced the soul.
The elders in the Beast Spirit Hall were anxious. What was happening with the Qing Cliff Eagles? They quickly dispatched someone to investigate.
In a mountain cave, Chen Xun and the big black ox laughed heartily, knowing that whether it was the same one or not, stealing the egg was done!
"Old Ox, see that? I told you earlier, could it possibly outlive you?!"
Chen Xun laughed heartily, looking at the white egg on the ground. "It's the one, alright. I could tell from the smell."
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox patted Chen Xun, its face filled with satisfaction, proud to be the big brother.
"Let's go, let's go, have we packed everything properly?"
"Moo~"
The big black ox nodded solemnly, having checked countless times that nothing was left behind.
Chen Xun and the big black ox glanced around and at the sky surreptitiously before gradually disappearing amidst these towering mountains.
Three days later, the egg inexplicably returned to its original location. The Qing Cliff Eagles, upon seeing it, trembled with anger, feeling insulted by such a blatant disregard!
This incident became a laughing matter among the disciples of the Beast Spirit Hall. Did they encounter ghosts? It seemed so.
On the way down the mountain, the big black ox was laden with pots, pans, and bowls again. These were now their old companions, but there were more storage bags this time, and a small wooden barrel of health-preserving tea hung from its head.
I still liked having these things around, listening to the tinkling sound, and feeling content all over. Chen Xun felt the same.
He changed into coarse linen clothes, handed over his clothes and the sect token at the main hall of the sect, but still carried the three mountain-opening axes.
They walked down the mountain like old peasants, step by step, towards the foot of the mountain. The disciples flying in the sky were still as vibrant as ever.
As if in a different world, Chen Xun and the big black ox looked relaxed as they observed their surroundings.
They arrived at the mountain gate, an ancient giant rock towering over them, taller than the trees, inscribed with some characters whose origin was unknown.
Like a symbol of time and like an inheritance, each stroke was vigorous and full of vitality.
Five Elements, Sect!
Chen Xun bowed respectfully, and the big black ox lowered its head, its eyes filled with solemnity.
They were leaving again. The road to longevity was always drifting, but it was full of unknowns and excitement.
Today's sun was scorching, a good day for setting off on a journey.
Chen Xun and the big black ox glanced beyond the huge rock, looking at the mountain path ahead. Damn it, we didn't say it. Why didn't you come...
"Let's go, old ox. I didn't inform these juniors back then. It's normal for them not to come."
Chen Xun flashed a moment of embarrassment, leading the big black ox slowly out of the mountain range. Once they left the array, they no longer belonged to the Five Elements Sect.
"Moo." The big black ox nodded. Indeed, Chen Xun didn't inform them.
Outside the array, under the vast sky, stood three figures who seemed to have been waiting there for a long time.
"Chen Junior Brother, Black Ox."
"Chen Junior Brother, Black Ox."
"Chen Junior Brother, Ox Junior Brother."
The three were none other than Shi Jing, Liu Yuan, and Ji Kun; their mouths curled in a smile. Everyone knows about Chen Xun's departure these days.
"Hey, look at this." Chen Xun laughed heartily, looking at the big black ox. "Old Ox, it was you who said it, right?"
"Moo? Moo moo moo?!" The big black ox was shocked, angrily biting Chen Xun's clothes. When did it say that?
"Chen Junior Brother, Black Ox, where are you planning to go?"
Shi Jing spoke, his eyes still carrying some melancholy, but he had come out of it a lot. "I have some connections in various places."
"Senior Brother Shi, you're too polite. I plan to go back to the countryside to marry a wife and farm."
Chen Xun said it with a bow, his eyes filled with sincerity. "Senior Brother Shi, don't be discouraged. At least you still have Senior Sister Liu by your side, which is much better than me and the old ox."
Shi Jing's eyes were full of vicissitudes, and he glanced at Liu Yuan inadvertently, nodding gently.
"Junior Brother Chen, Black Ox, take care on your journey."
A touch of charm appeared on Liu Yuan's face as she smiled at Chen Xun. "If there's ever a chance, come back and visit."
"...Take care."
"Moo~"
Chen Xun and the big black ox also looked at Liu Yuan. That junior sister from back then seemed to have grown capable now.
Ji Kun now had white hair all over, looking older than when he was in the Qi Refining Stage. However, the occasional gleam in his eyes indicated he was no ordinary person.
Chen Xun had long noticed Ji Kun; how could he suddenly have white hair overnight?
"Junior Brother Chen, Ox Junior Brother." Ji Kun seemed to show a long-lost smile, with a hint of tremor and warmth.
"Ji...Senior Brother."
"Moo~~"
Chen Xun bowed slowly, but his eyes were filled with deep concern; there was definitely something wrong with his body.
The big black ox walked slowly to Ji Kun, gently rubbing against him. Only Ji Kun treated it as a junior in the sect.
Why did Chen Xun help Ji Kun like this? Although he never said it, the big black ox had long known it. It was all for that one phrase, "Ox Junior Brother"...
"Ox Junior Brother." Ji Kun smiled, his eyes showing warmth. He patted the big black ox's head, recognizing them both as brothers from the Nine Star Valley.
He walked slowly to Chen Xun and took out an ancient book from his storage bag. "Junior Brother Chen, I'm entrusting this to you."
This item was unique to the Ji family, passed down from ancient times, and could only be activated by Ji bloodline. He forcibly activated it by refining his blood essence, just to give it to Chen Xun.
Although it was incomplete, it was the only treasure he had left.
The overnight white hair was also because of this. He couldn't give Chen Xun anything, so he could only give him this last hope.
"Senior Brother Ji, take it back!"
Chen Xun frowned, his tone rising. "I've never helped you with any expectations. It's because you're my friend, Ji Kun."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox also nodded beside him. They had never thought about these things.
"Between friends, there's no such thing as who owes who. Otherwise, what's the point of having friends?"
Ji Kun's voice was deep, and his face was full of smiles. He patted Chen Xun's shoulder with one hand. "Right?"
Chen Xun took a deep breath, meeting Ji Kun's gaze, just like they did when they first met at the foot of the mountain. They nodded heavily.
Ji Kun smiled, placing the item in Chen Xun's hands, with no regrets in his heart.
Chen Xun and the big black ox walked further and further, suddenly stopping in their tracks. Chen Xun turned around and shouted:
"Senior Brother Ji, Senior Brother Shi, and Senior Sister Liu, if we meet on the streets in the future, don't forget to say hello! Exchange a few words with me and the old ox!"
"Moo~~!!"
"Of course!"
"Definitely!"
"Don't talk nonsense; hurry up!"
...
The three also suddenly shouted, completely devoid of the demeanor of Foundation Establishment cultivators, their eyes only filled with blessings for their friends' departure.
Chen Xun bowed and laughed heartily at them from afar. "Old Ox! Let's go!"
"Moo! Moo?" The big black ox also shouted at the three, then looked at Chen Xun, wondering which way to go...
All around were vast roads and wilderness, the sun shining overhead as if illustrating the grandeur of life's progress.
Chen Xun gazed into the wilderness with his hands behind his back, pretending to be profound. "On the path of longevity, there's no need to hesitate, no need to look back, no need to sigh. Wherever your gaze falls, that's the way forward."
"Old Ox, pick a direction casually. Without a destination, just charge!"
"But today, I want to ride..."
"Moo!!"
Before the words were finished, the big black ox, with a heavy snort, dashed out, sand flying everywhere. Chen Xun, still looking bewildered, stood in place.
After a while, he finally reacted, looking in the direction of the big black ox and frantically chasing after it.
Veins bulging, features contorted, Chen Xun yelled as he chased, "Old Ox, I haven't gotten on yet! Old Ox! I haven't gotten on yet!!!"
"Moo moo!!!"
With rolling yellow sand, the two figures grew farther and farther away, gradually disappearing from sight.
The three outside the mountain gate smiled at each other, watching the vanished figures, feeling emotional. They always seemed so carefree and unrestrained.
Some people will always be engraved in memory. Even if you forgot their voice, their smile, or their face,. But whenever you thought of them, that feeling would never change. Perhaps Junior Brother Chen was such a person.
They had completely left the Five Elements Sect. The world of cultivation was vast and exciting. From now on, they would leap freely across the sea and soar freely in the sky.
