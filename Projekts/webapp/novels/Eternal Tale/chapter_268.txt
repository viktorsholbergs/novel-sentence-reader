“The Baili Clan, the true cultivator army, the vanguard of the Great Li Realm!”
“They’re the descendants of the War Boundary Camp from the human realm!
In each city, major powers exclaimed in shock. The Baili Clan had always been extremely low-key in the Great Li Realm, but their strength was indisputable—no one dared provoke them!
Their true battlefield was near the Heavenly River, and the Great Li Realm merely served as their rear base. Even so, their forces here could easily rival a major power.
Anger the Baili Clan, and the War Boundary Camp near the Heavenly River would retaliate, leaving rivers of blood. No one could endure such wrath.
“So this is the legendary Baili Clan…”
“When the Heavenly Gate opens, there will be a bloodbath. If you’re afraid now, don’t even bother going!”
“Great opportunities always come with great risks. As cultivators, we must be fearless. The Baili Clan has taken the first step—I’m going too!”
A roaring commotion swept across the cities. For many, this was the first time witnessing an army of cultivators. In their understanding, cultivators always fought alone.
Countless cultivators were still in shock, unable to recover from the awe-inspiring scene.
Some turned pale as paper, their minds buzzing, bodies trembling with cold.
“We’d better leave… The Heavenly Gate isn’t for us.”
“Y-yes, agreed.”
In the corners of the cities, some Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged hesitant whispers, their spirits shattered, blood frozen.
While some resolutely followed the Baili Clan’s War Boundary Boats, others fled in the opposite direction.
Three figures stood frozen in a dilapidated courtyard, dumbfounded by the overwhelming scene. This was merely the prelude to the campaign.
“Incredible…”
“Moo~”
“Terrifying…”
Chen Xun, the big black ox, and Little Red exchanged glances, their jaws agape. This far exceeded their understanding—neither Chen Xun nor the big black ox had ever witnessed such a grand mobilization.
Back then, they’d been relegated to logistics and farming. Even if they’d wanted to join, they couldn’t. Besides, the purpose of those past wars was entirely different.
Buzz!
Buzz!
The sky was filled with thunderous roaring as one warship after another appeared, soaring into the vast, cloudless heavens. The clouds had been completely scattered.
Following behind the Baili Clan’s fleet, their blood-stained banners fluttered in the wind, igniting both passion and fear in onlookers.
Chen Xun’s breathing grew heavier. The densely packed warships whistling overhead made him truly understand the scale of the cultivation world and the meaning of being a cultivator.
The big black ox snorted hot air, frozen in awe at the unimaginable sight.
Little Red trembled beneath the ox’s belly. The overwhelming, fearless aura had surpassed the limits of mere strength. Such a human force could never be defeated.
In Little Red’s eyes was deep fear. The ancient war between humans and spirit beasts had long predestined its outcome.
“Let’s go, brothers. The factions are assembling.”
“Moo!”
“Slow down, Brother Ox!”
The three stepped out of the shop, their spirits shaken as if entering an entirely new world.
The streets were filled with cultivators wielding magical weapons, striding briskly with icy determination in their eyes.
They came from major sects, noble families, and even rogue cultivators who knew the truth. The uproar was earth-shattering.
Chen Xun and his companions took a deep breath and merged into the vast sea of people for the first time, journeying alongside these cultivators toward the teleportation array on the west coast.
On the way. They encountered many cultivators, instinctively casting a few more glances at them.
“Qi Gengyun, you don’t need to follow me. The thousand-year Heavenly Gate journey spares few. I have no hope of reaching Nascent Soul and can only take this path.”
“Heh, Zhuang Yun, you’re only in the early Golden Core stage. Without someone protecting you, the Filth Reaper won’t show mercy. What if you die?”
“You, with dual spiritual roots and late Golden Core stage, have a chance to break through to Nascent Soul in the Great Li Realm. There’s no need to take this risk.”
Zhuang Yun frowned, glancing at the carefree man. They’d grown up together in the sect, but their standings were now worlds apart. “If I die, then so be it!”
“Ha, easy for you to say. Do you think I care about you?”
Qi Gengyun laughed loudly, giving Zhuang Yun a sidelong glance. “I’m just going to enlist in the army and happen to be traveling the same way. Woman, you’re overthinking this, haha.”
“You!” Zhuang Yun fumed, flicking her sleeve and turning away, unwilling to deal with him. “Suit yourself.”
Qi Gengyun snorted coldly but instinctively moved closer to her, fearing she might disappear into the crowd of cultivators.
Zhuang Yun felt a warmth in her heart and said no more.
As Chen Xun and his group passed by the two figures, a faint smile tugged at his lips.
“Old Ox, Little Red, calm your minds and focus. Don’t lose your composure.”
“Moo!”
“Brother Xun… I, the Beigong Red Lion, I’m risking it all,” Little Red said, his voice trembling as he looked at the countless cultivators and large spirit beasts converging from all directions. “If I die, please take me back to Tian Duan…”
Before he could finish, the big black ox grabbed him with its mouth and placed him on its back. Little Red twitched, collapsing weakly onto the ox’s back.
Chen Xun and the big black ox both grew serious. Overhead, the sky was filled with countless warships; on the ground, an endless stream of cultivators moved. The atmosphere before the massive teleportation arrays was heavy and solemn—they were no longer charging spirit stones.
Behind Guiyi City, the teleportation arrays flickered continuously as powerful cultivators emerged. Pillars of spiritual light shot skyward, shaking the heavens.
Cultivators from across the Great Li Realm were converging on the west coast!
The Great Li Realm, Fenglin Prefecture, Lingwu Ancient Immortal Sect—one of the five great ancient sects.
Here, over a hundred main peaks pierced the clouds, with lightning coiling around the mountain range's periphery. The grand formations were astonishing and majestic.
Today, the normally tranquil peaks were shrouded in mist and swept by turbulent winds and clouds.
Even the supreme elders emerged from seclusion, their overwhelming auras heavy with solemnity and silence.
Above the skies, Nascent Soul cultivators traveled through the air, their rainbow lights dazzling. Disciples across the peaks, unaware of the situation, looked on in shock—was the sect facing a major upheaval?
On one of the peaks, a man sat cross-legged, exuding an air of aloof detachment.
Abruptly, he opened his eyes, stood up, and bowed in a certain direction. “Master, the Heavenly Gate is about to open. It’s time for me to depart.”
“Have you decided?” A distant voice came from all directions, tinged with a sigh. “The Heavenly River's banks are littered with countless bones. In the end, it may all be for naught.”
“I have decided. Someone must pave the way. The Baili Clan fears nothing, and neither do I.”
The man’s gaze was steady as he bowed slightly. “I ask Master to activate the teleportation array. I am ready to leave now.”
