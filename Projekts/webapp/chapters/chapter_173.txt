Shamoli, along with a few loyal members of his tribe, snuck through the forest for several days and nights, not daring to look back or light a fire to cook. When hungry, they ate a few fruits; when thirsty, they scooped up water to drink. They had finally managed to escape the territory of Eastern Mount Yue.
Upon encountering the bustling and affluent towns of the Easterners filled with throngs of people, they were stupefied by the sight. Disguised as refugees from Mount Yue, they were taken into custody and could only watch from a distance as the lively scenes of horse-drawn carriages and cloud-like canopies moved westward; the sound of opera drifting in the air.
"This Eastern lifestyle... it's practically divine!" Shamoli remarked in awe, finally understanding why the slaves were so desperate to flee eastward.
After being confined for several hours, Shamoli noticed an opulently dressed Mount Yue tribesman approaching. His spirits lifted immediately. This person was a former vassal of the Mulu Family who had disappeared years ago, presumably to enjoy life in the East.
Shamoli quickly called out to him in their native Mount Yue language.
"Hey, skinny... look this way!"
That person's expression turned into annoyance almost immediately, and he looked toward the direction of the shout. Suddenly, bursting with joy, he shouted loudly, "Quick, seize that man! He is a royal descendant of Eastern Mount Yue!"
Shamoli, who possessed the strength of the third stage of Embryonic Breathing Realm, did not resist and was meekly taken away, eventually thrown into a courtyard paved with stone slabs.
Kneeling on the cold, smooth ground, Shamoli looked up timidly to see a young man about fourteen or fifteen years old staring back at him. The youth's stern appearance and penetrating gray eyes gave off an overwhelming sense of authority.
"Greet... Greetings, Your Majesty!"
Shamoli speculated that this imposing figure was likely Li Xuanxuan, who appeared youthful due to attaining the Qi Cultivation Realm early in life. Despite this, Li Xuanxuan was still his uncle.
"You must be joking," Li Yuanxiu responded with a slight smile, amused by the unexpected turn of events. He had to suppress the urge to burst into laughter at the thought of having such an advantage over Mount Yue, courteously engaging with the trembling Mount Yue prince while sizing him up mentally.
"I am Li Yuanxiu, the eldest legitimate son of the family head. I believe we are of the same generation," Li Yuanxiu began as he introduced himself.
It was only at this moment that Shamoli learned that he was speaking to the heir of the Easterner King. He smiled at Li Yuanxiu politely and was about to speak when another person resembling Li Yuanxiu came in, interrupting him.
The newcomer had shorter eyebrows and longer eyes, giving off a more predatory aura. Shamoli instinctively bowed his head in fear.
"Yuanjiao is overjoyed to hear that a cousin has come to visit!" the newcomer announced as he approached.
Shamoli's face immediately lit up with joy, thinking this person must be his support in the East. "Ah, so you're Brother Jiao! Your reputation precedes you! You're even better looking than I expected," he quickly added hastily.
Li Yuanjiao curled his lips, stood next to Li Yuanxiu, and stared at the people below. The people from Mount Yue knew that he was a descendant of the Mulu Family and given the way he had treated them, they all looked up to him in admiration.
"I've heard about your father's incident… would you be willing to explain it to us again so that we can understand the whole story?" Li Yuanxiu asked leisurely as he took his seat, holding his cup of tea in his hand.
Shamoli trembled in his seat and quickly replied, "Yes… of course!"
He quickly narrated the events surrounding Mu Jiaoman's death in detail, taking nearly half an hour to explain everything in great detail without leaving out anything. Only then did the surrounding people finally understand and begin whispering among themselves.
Li Yuanxiu waved his hand, his expression slightly shifting, disappointed at how foolish Shamoli was.
I specifically called everyone here to let him state the facts, yet this simpleton really just laid it all flat out, not even trying to smear some dirt on his older brother to give my Li Family a pretext to intervene! Truly a waste of my kindness...
Looking up at the others in the room, Li Yuanxiu softly commanded, "I'd like to speak privately with Shamoli. I'll have to ask the elders to step out for now."
A few clan elders frowned and were about to speak, but Li Yuanjiao hummed and stepped forward, staring them down. Knowing they had no choice, they left reluctantly. As the clan elders left, the crowd quickly dispersed like the tide, leaving only the clan soldiers behind and the two brothers Li Yuanxiu and Li Yuanjiao. Li Qiuyang stood beside Shamoli, preventing him from ambushing anyone.
Li Yuanxiu quickly left his seat and took Shamoli's hand with a friendly gesture, smiling as he said, "Brother Shamoli, with the elders around earlier, Yuanxiu couldn't speak freely. We are sort of relatives, so formality isn't needed between us!"
Shamoli was stunned, not expecting Li Yuanxiu to be so approachable, stuttering without daring to speak. Li Yuanxiu then continued, "When your father was critically injured, Lord Qimu usurped the throne and against the former king's wishes, he slaughtered the other lords… truly an unfilial act! Since my Li Family has promised to protect Eastern Mount Yue, we can't sit by and do nothing! Please rest assured."
These words left Shamoli dumbfounded. His mind went blank right away, doubting internally if he had failed to make the story clear. It was his father who passed the position to Qimu and personally ordered the execution of his other sons, but in Li Yuanxiu's mouth, the story changed completely...
Shamoli looked at Li Yuanxiu's smiling face, and a spark of realization flashed through his mind instantly. A trembling surge of desire that he had long suppressed, thinking the throne was beyond his reach, suddenly made him shiver with both joy and horror.
He immediately replied with great eagerness.
"Yes… Yes! Lord Qimu took advantage of the king's critical injuries to usurp the throne and then, against the king's wishes, slaughtered many lords..."
Li Yuanxiu was relieved to see this simpleton finally grasp the situation and sighed in relief as if a burden had been lifted off his chest.
"Your father could also be considered Brother Jiao's uncle, and this offense is an affront to the Li Family as well. You should enjoy your stay at the foot of the mountain for now and take in the scenery of the East, which is quite different from Mount Yue. I will report this to the elders and then come find you," he said with a smile.
Shamoli's mind was ablaze with visions of returning to Mount Yue to reclaim his throne.
He nodded in agreement before snapping back to reality, fervently saying, "I cannot possibly repay the great kindness of the esteemed Li Family! I am willing to pave the way for the Li Family, to guard the West for the Li Family, and to pay tribute annually!"
Li Yuanxiu waved his hand, speechless at how off-point Shamoli was, thinking to himself.
Guarding the West and paying annual tribute… how is that any different from how it is practiced now..? Shamoli really can't get to the point, showing no sensitivity to the situation at all!
After such thoughts, Li Yuanxiu nodded and left the courtyard to go up the mountain, leaving Shamoli and Li Yuanjiao to stare at each other.
Shamoli was still lost in his daydreams when Li Yuanjiao glanced at him and patted the shoulder of his distant relative, whispering in his ear, "Our Eastern beauties and music are the most renowned… Cousin might as well go have a look."
"Ah..! Sure…" Shamoli mumbled as he left the courtyard in a daze.
Meanwhile, Li Yuanjiao nodded to Li Qiuyang, whispering to him, "I'll leave the rest up to you, Clan Uncle. Please select some singers and dancers carefully, we must ensure Shamoli leaves behind a few offspring who stay in the town to study. Only by achieving this can we truly hold Mount Yue in our grasp."
"I understand."
Li Qiuyang nodded and cupped his fist before leaving, not showing any disrespect to Li Yuanjiao just because he was younger.
