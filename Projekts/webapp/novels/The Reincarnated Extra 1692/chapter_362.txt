Crush the Mechanical and Grotesque Puppets! 3
* * *
(I don’t… I don’t get it…)
Emi, with her usual expressionless face, but feeling dissatisfied deep down, grumbled.
“Pipiii! Pipipipi!”
“““Pipipipiiiiーーー!”””
The full-body armored soldiers rushed towards her, but she glanced at them nonchalantly.
“…………”
She casually swung her 【Black Arms】, which she had grown from her shoulders, in a horizontal sweep.
“Pi”
“Pipi”
““Pipipii””
The full-body armored soldiers couldn’t even resist the speed of that giant whip-like attack, their bodies struck and blown away.
It was a blow that would have shattered the body of an ordinary human, leading to death.
However.
“Pi… pipi…”
“Kyururururu…”
These guys are abnormally tough.
Even if she properly knocks them down, they’d get back up again and again, their armor dented and mangled, but seemingly without feeling any pain.
“Haa…”
Seeing this scene, which had already been repeated several times, Emi sighed.
“I’m tired…”
She finally voiced her exhaustion.
Yes, she’s tired.
She was supposed to just take some flowers to a hill on the outskirts of the city to fulfill the wish of an old woman she was indebted to.
That’s all she had to do.
But somehow, she ended up in a series of battles.
The Demon Lord’s army, a cult.
And now, these mysterious full-body armored soldiers.
She took a nap and her injuries healed to some extent, but she hasn’t fully recovered from her fatigue.
How on earth had it come to this?
She doesn’t understand at all.
<…It’s Emi’s fault for getting involved in things that don’t concern her, right?>
Extra-sama, her mind roommate, said that in an exasperated tone.
<You attacked both the Demon Lord’s army and the cult… because you were frustrated, right? And now you’re tired, so it’s your own fault.>
“…………”
Emi had nothing to say to that.
<Even now, it’s the same. You can just ignore these guys. Let’s run away.>
“Pipipipiiiiーーー!”
While punching away another full-body armored soldier that attacked, Emi looked around.
Lying around were Kingdom soldiers, barely clinging to life.
And behind her, the good-for-nothing man she had just barely saved, was trembling, shielding the female soldier.
(…I don’t want to.)
<Why not?>
Here, Emi unclenched her fist, stretching her fingers.
And from her fingertips, she extended blades of mana, invisible to ordinary humans.
【Great Mantis】.
“““Pipipipiiiiーーー!”””
Emi, dancing gracefully, sliced at the attacking full-body armored soldiers with her 【Great Mantis】!
Its sharpness is exceptional!
BACHII!
With that sound, sparks scattering, the full-body armored soldiers were sliced in two, top and bottom, and stopped moving.
“Grandma lived in this town.”
Perhaps finally wary of Emi, the full-body armored soldiers, surrounding her, no longer carelessly approached.
“This is a place of memories.”
Emi muttered.
Her eyes, ignited with fighting spirit.
Fwoosh!
And with a powerful burst, jet-black haze erupted from her entire body!
<…I understand. You’re stubborn, Emi. If that’s what you’ve decided, I won’t say anything more.>
Sensing that fighting spirit and killing intent welling up from Emi’s soul once again, Extra-sama sighed and gave up on escaping.
<But Emi, don’t let your guard down. These guys are quite troublesome. I have an idea… look at their cross-section.>
Told that, Emi looked down at the full-body armored soldier lying on the ground, sliced in two.
It was cleanly bisected, upper and lower body… For an ordinary human, blood or whatever should be overflowing from that cross-section, with flesh and bones exposed.
But that wasn’t the case with these guys.
What’s visible in their cross-section is not flesh and bone, but wires and cables.
What’s scattered around is not flesh and blood, but some kind of metal parts.
And also.
Crackle, crackle!
Occasionally, with such sounds, electric currents ran through, and sparks scattered from their cross-section.
In other words, these guys.
As she thought for a moment when she crushed one before.
“…………Machines?”
<That’s right. I think these guys are probably…>
“Hey, hey, heeeeeyyyy!?”
At that moment.
Interrupting Emi and Extra-sama’s conversation, pushing through the full-body armored soldiers… a single man appeared.
It’s a man with his entire face painted white, except for sloppily applied lipstick and purple eyeliner.
His hair is tied up in two buns on both sides of his head, and he’s wearing baggy clothes with excessive decorations.
“You, you, youuuu! Suddenly appearing, what are you doingggg!? Please don’t interfereeee!”
That man… Chubos the jester, making strange movements, shouted in a ridiculous voice.
