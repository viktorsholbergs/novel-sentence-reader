Chen Xun stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the horizon, showing no fear whatsoever in the face of the immense celestial might. In his heart, there was only devotion and earnestness.
"The old ox has thick skin and tough flesh, only slightly inferior to me, and is most devoted to the heavens." Chen Xun began to speak to himself, full of emotion. "Even if I were to be struck dead by the heavens, they would never target it."
Despite the thunderous roar, his expression became calm.
He sat cross-legged in mid-air, beginning to sense the changes within himself, patiently waiting for the big black ox to transcend the tribulation.
"This thunder tempering seems to be evolving the body, but not a sublimation brought by the cultivation realm." Chen Xun muttered to himself, his eyes filled with contemplation, while his body surface also began to change gradually.
At this moment, a tremendous rumbling sound echoed from the sky once again.
Chen Xun just slightly glanced upwards, the small black silhouette in the distance was still intact, already prostrating in gratitude to the heavens.
After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, he inexplicably felt that even if he were to die, his body would remain uncorrupted for a thousand years.
The Nascent Soul was no longer a mortal body, completely detached from the realm of ordinary people. Even if the physical body was destroyed, it could be rebuilt through the Nascent Soul.
However, for a Golden Core cultivator, the primordial spirit is not evident, and the physical body is still mortal. The demonic possession techniques refer to Golden Core cultivators but do not increase longevity.
There are also considerable limitations; at most, possession allows one to linger in the world, but it cannot restore one to their peak.
But for a Nascent Soul ancestor, physical body reconstruction is entirely different. As long as the body fits, there is a chance to return to peak form.
"This physical body—what a strange feeling." Chen Xun's eyes were bright and clear, and his whole body no longer like it was cast in silver.
**Crack!**
The black hair behind him slowly transformed into silver, arcs of electricity coursed through his body, and his skin shimmered with intense white light, as if suppressing a transcendent power.
An immense vitality and vigor surged within Chen Xun, and in such a state, he felt his chances of survival had increased.
If he couldn't win, at least he could withstand, and if he could withstand, there was a chance to escape. Thinking this, Chen Xun slowly stood up, no longer sitting cross-legged in the air.
His demeanor changed drastically, arms crossed, his posture tall and slender, exuding an imposing aura.
He stood far away under the heavenly tribulation, but this magnificent scene held no interest for him now, his eyes fixed solely on the big black ox.
**Boom!**
Lightning pierced the sky, illuminating the heavens, crashing down with dazzling brilliance!
The violent gale continuously buffeted his robes, hair, and the hat on his back, blowing them wildly backward.
Yet he remained unmoved, standing still in the air with arms crossed, as if embodying an indomitable spirit!
At this moment, a faint smile appeared on Chen Xun's lips:
"Old ox, our journey is just beginning..."
"Moo~~!!"
From the center of the heavenly tribulation came a mournful roar, shaking the heavens and the earth, causing the ground to tremble and the desert sands to surge.
The big black ox closed its eyes, tears streaming down, biting its lips tightly as blood dripped continuously.
The thunder roared on, the sky filled with white light, and time passed bit by bit under the heavenly tribulation.
"Moo!!!"
A sudden transformation occurred!
A colossal ox's head silhouette slowly appeared on the ground, struggling to lift its head, making Chen Xun's pupils tremble as his gaze followed.
"Oh, as expected of the Black Ox." Chen Xun took a deep breath, the immense pressure pounding against him. "Damn it, could this be the future, old ox..."
**Boom!**
**Rumble!!**
The ox's head silhouette stood on the ground, finally raising its head, eyes filled with endless coldness and calmness, as if ready to battle the heavens.
An ox's hoof slowly extended, reaching towards the thunderclouds.
The tribulation seemed to grow even more violent, and simultaneously, the ox's head silhouette began to split, heads growing from within.
They seemed to exhale fiery breaths simultaneously, shaking the entire void!
Five heads and ten arms, all glaring at the thick thunderclouds, and ten ox hooves struck out at the heavenly tribulation!
"Shit!!!" Chen Xun's scalp tingled, unable to help but shout, retreating hundreds of meters from the impact of the immense power.
"Moo~~!!"
A roar, seemingly from ancient times, echoed from all directions, causing the entire sea of thunder to pause and even the awestruck Chen Xun to freeze.
"Shit... shit..." Chen Xun lost all composure, muttering incessantly, his eyes wide as he looked up at the distant, high sky.
As the ox's head silhouette struck, a great wind arose, clouds flying!
The ox's head within the silhouette showed no fear, ten hooves reaching towards the thunderclouds, shaking the void.
**Boom!**
The heavens and earth roared, and lightning flashed endlessly.
The atmosphere of desolation and slaughter seemed to be completely dispersed, and the thunderclouds gradually retreated with the heavenly tribulation, finally becoming unstable and about to vanish.
Following this came the vast, colorful clouds, celebrating the heavens and earth, illuminating the boundless night sky.
Chen Xun, just like the big black ox a few days ago, was shaken to his core. In this terrifying scene, it seemed like the old ox had gone mad.
At this moment, the big black ox was still in tears, but a wave of immense anger surged within—it wouldn't allow anyone to harm Chen Xun!!!
On its head sat five small calves, surrounded by divine light, exuding sacred tranquility.
This sight made Chen Xun laugh, instantly breaking his composure. These small calves must be the big black ox when it was young.
"Moo!!" The big black ox suddenly opened its eyes, arcs of electricity flashing within. It evaporated its tears, searching everywhere for Chen Xun. Where was he?
Its fur grew denser and blacker, looking like it was clad in black scales from a distance, appearing extremely formidable.
The big black ox finally succeeded in its breakthrough, reaching the Ox Ancestor Realm,' the Nascent Soul stage!
"Old Ox!!"
"Moo!"
The big black ox followed the sound, tears welling up again. Chen Xun had died horribly, at least a hundred times...
There was a time when Chen Xun claimed to be more handsome than it, and out of shame, he jumped into a river to commit suicide in front of it.
The big black ox shook off all distracting thoughts, absorbed the five Nascent Souls into its body, and rushed towards Chen Xun.
Once again, man and ox ran towards each other, embracing tightly and exchanging sly smiles.
They both thought the same: in the Heart Tribulation, your death was truly too 'sloppy.'
Chen Xun looked up at the clouds, exhaling deeply: "Old Ox, we finally made it!"
"Moo!!" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun, its mouth breaking into a wide grin. Big brother was indeed not dead.
Chen Xun patted the big black ox, a smile naturally spreading on his face. The vastness of the world—they could finally go and see it all.
No longer did they need to live in constant fear in this world of cultivation, where the weak are prey to the strong, feeling like ants and sensing danger everywhere.
The big black ox sat on the ground, gazing at the colorful clouds and exhaling a breath—it was truly beautiful.
They kindled a bonfire made of crane spirit wood in front of them, quietly admiring the radiant night sky, the joy of their breakthrough slowly fading.
"Old Ox, we should also go home and have a look." Chen Xun's eyes grew distant, his right hand on the big black ox. "I can't remember how long we've been away."
"Moo~" The big black ox nodded dumbly. It couldn't count, either.
"Let's stabilize our Nascent Souls, then we'll go home."
"Moo~" The big black ox grinned. It actually missed home quite a lot.
After wandering for so long, it could no longer find the sense of spiritual solace it had once felt.
As the colorful clouds in the sky dispersed, Chen Xun and the big black ox performed a ritual, thanking the heavens.
The big black ox no longer displayed the ferocity it had shown during the tribulation, immediately kneeling and prostrating, mooing tearfully. Chen Xun couldn't pull it up.
After covering their traces and making all preparations, they began to descend, creating a new underground dwelling.
Chen Xun and the big black ox sat cross-legged, each stabilizing their Nascent Souls, feeling this new world.
What is a Nascent Soul ancestor? It's an existence capable of founding a sect and passing down a legacy, with a deeper understanding of the heavens and earth, reaching a new level.
One can now create their own cultivation methods and spells. With the presence of the Nascent Soul within, there is a new level of control over the body's meridians.
It's no longer easy to go astray in cultivation. Chen Xun roamed this new world, unable to extricate himself for a long time.
It seemed he had a new understanding of his 'Starfall' technique. The mysteries of spiritual energy were becoming clearer, revealing their nuances.
"Amazing..." Chen Xun praised the Nascent Soul stage in his heart, already forming new plans for the future.
At that time, he wouldn't just visit the spirit herb garden but also learn from various sects, mastering their strengths. The Nascent Soul stage had the power to integrate all knowledge.
"Walking through the cultivation world and not learning all you can is truly a waste." Chen Xun chuckled, a proud smile spreading across his face. "After all, we seek immortality."
"Moo?"
"The Black Ox, stop spying on me, focus on stabilizing your realm."
"Moo~"
The big black ox nodded obediently, not thinking further.
...
Three months later, in the western border city of Huai Ping in the Qian Nation.
At the horizon, the setting sun cast a slanting light, the twilight deepened, and smoke clouds drifted by.
A figure riding an ox gradually appeared on the horizon, both wearing tattered straw hats, looking extremely relaxed and leisurely.
They walked slowly from the horizon, a man and an ox returning at dusk, their shadows stretched long by the setting sun...
