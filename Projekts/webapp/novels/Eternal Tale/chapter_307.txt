A Month Later, at the Border Between Yuan Prefecture of Great Li Realm and Eastern Jingzhou
The two prefectures were separated by the towering, majestic Ten Thousand Mountains, home to ancient mythical beasts, including the Jiuhua Sealing Demon Ape and many other spiritual creatures.
Here, the mountains stretched endlessly, peaks rising and falling in a grand and imposing spectacle, their summits piercing the heavens.
The aura within was exceptionally powerful, with cultivators stationed everywhere. This was the ancestral land of the Baili Clan, a place rarely visited by outsiders.
Today, three figures, travel-worn and weary, strode forward while casually eating oranges, leaving behind afterimages on the ground.
Buzz!
From the sky came two resounding steps upon the void. Baili Wentian and the Jiuhua Patriarch moved simultaneously, their gazes filled with unprecedented solemnity—outside, an overwhelming presence suppressed the entirety of the Ten Thousand Mountains!
From deep within the mountains came a vast and resonant roar, its imposing force at least at the late Nascent Soul stage.
At the frontlines, a fierce battle raged, while the rear prepared in kind. The Ten Thousand Mountains housed numerous military camps, with immense, surging lifeblood energy piercing the sky—these were reserve forces, ready to march into battle at any moment!
Just then, massive exotic birds soared across the firmament, casting their colossal shadows upon the three small figures below.
“I am Chen Xun, here to visit the Baili Clan!” Chen Xun halted, his resounding voice spreading in all directions. In his hand a jade slip shot toward the heavens. “I hope everyone will grant Commander Zhonghu some respect!”
“Moo! Moo!”
A big black ox bellowed, dust billowing in all directions with an overwhelming presence.
Little Red's pupils shrank—numerous gazes had locked onto him. His expression gradually turned somewhat sheepish, and the fiery runic mark at his brow instantly dimmed.
Throughout the Ten Thousand Mountains, countless war banners stood tall, exuding a commanding and iron-blooded aura.
Roar!
Roar!
One by one, colossal spiritual beasts rose from the earth, all gazing toward the mountains’ edge. Yet, in the next instant, their auras were suppressed by the presence of a certain plain-robed man.
Baili Wentian clasped his hands behind his back, catching the jade slip in midair. His eyes narrowed as he took a deep look at Chen Xun—he could not discern the man’s depth.
“Daoist Jiuhua, this bears Zhonghu’s personal inscription, imbued with his divine sense.”
“Mm.”
The Jiuhua Patriarch, his towering body as steady as a mountain, slowly turned his gaze toward Chen Xun. “Fellow Daoists, please enter the mountains.”
He cast a long look at the big black ox and Little Red, sensing no restrictive spells upon them. Their relationship with the man seemed akin to the beasts of the Baili Clan.
Chen Xun smiled faintly, cupped his hands slightly, and patted the big black ox and Little Red before stepping into the Ten Thousand Mountains together.
At the mountain entrance, ranks of iron-blooded soldiers slightly cupped their hands in greeting, their expressions solemn as they maintained due respect toward cultivator seniors.
One incense stick’s time later.
Five figures arrived at a clearing. The Jiuhua Patriarch, towering as he was, seemed unable to shrink his form, placing immense pressure on Little Red.
Introductions began, and the atmosphere turned lively. All present were kindred spirits, with no ill intentions.
Chen Xun had, of course, met this extraordinary man before—the very one who had led the charge in battle and escorted them along the way. His respect for him ran deep.
“You there, are you a Blazing Red Ancient Lion?”
The Jiuhua Patriarch’s voice boomed like a great bell, rolling down toward Little Red with immense force. “I remember your clan’s insignia.”
“Brother Xun! Brother Ox!!”
Little Red cried out in alarm—had his identity been discovered?!
Baili Wentian furrowed his brow. How could a Blazing Red Ancient Lion possibly shrink in size? That would be akin to a human abandoning their own heritage.
“Moo?!”
The big black ox slowly raised its head and roared in defiance, locking eyes with the Jiuhua Patriarch. Their gazes clashed with earth-shaking force, and in an instant, storm clouds gathered across the heavens.
Patriarch Jiuhua's expression twitched as an overwhelming sense of dread surged through him. His thick white fur stood on end—just what was this black ox’s origin?!
“Fellow Daoist Black Ox, I bear no ill intent.” His deep, resonant voice echoed through the mountains, even stirring the wind. “The Blazing Red Ancient Lion Clan was once a close ally of my Jiuhua Sealing Demon Ape Clan.”
“Moo moo~~”
The big black ox grinned, nodding heavily before resuming its usual simple and honest demeanor.
“That’s right, Little Red does belong to the Blazing Red Ancient Lion Clan.” Chen Xun glanced at Little Red, positioning himself in front of him protectively. “I’ve heard that someone in Great Li Realm is hunting them. Do you know who it is? I would appreciate any information.”
His voice was calm and indifferent as if he were merely asking in passing.
Jiuhua Patriarch and Baili Wentian exchanged a look before the latter slowly spoke. “The Lingwu Ancient Immortal Sect, the ancient cultivation family Jiang, and the White Jade Merchant Guild—these three major factions.”
“Brother Xun...”
“I see. It looks like we’ll have to be more careful in the future. Heh, all of them are untouchable forces in the cultivation world.”
Chen Xun waved a hand, cutting off Little Red’s words with a peaceful expression. “Thank you both for the information. We asked merely out of curiosity.”
“Moo?”
The big black ox nudged Chen Xun gently, only to be pressed back down by him.
“During the war between the Great Li Realm human cultivators and the spirit beasts back then, my Baili Clan did not take part. Given the circumstances, we could only help many spirit beasts escape.”
Baili Wentian met Chen Xun’s gaze with sincerity. “Daoist Chen, may I ask which faction you belong to?”
“That’s right.”
A deep voice resonated. “Many Blazing Red Lions and other spirit beasts used the Baili Clan’s large teleportation array to escape to another cultivation realm.”
They had instinctively explained themselves as if beneath that calm voice lurked an unfathomable killing intent.
Though Chen Xun carried no trace of hostility or murderous aura, no one who reached the Nascent Soul stage could be considered truly benevolent, especially after they had read the contents of the jade slip.
All their words converged into a single understanding: the late-stage Nascent Soul scourge on the battlefield—Chen Xun would handle it!
“I come from Qian Nation. I am not from the Great Li Realm cultivation world.”
“What?!”
Two slightly surprised voices rang out as they scrutinized Chen Xun once more. That realm could still produce such a figure?
Baili Wentian clasped one hand behind his back, his expression serious. “So, Daoist Chen has found the hidden large teleportation array.”
“The large teleportation arrays between the Great Li Realm and that cultivation realm were severed long ago. When my Baili Clan helped the spirit beasts escape back then, we destroyed the arrays as well—leaving only one behind.”
“But that remaining array was activated a few years ago. A junior also claimed to have come from Qian Nation and has since joined the reserve army.”
His expression was complex. That teleportation array on the other side had long been destroyed. There was no way to transport from here—given the cultivation resources available in that realm, he couldn’t fathom how they had managed to repair it.
However, he had not questioned that junior’s secrets. Everyone had their own fortunes.
“I see.”
Chen Xun nodded naturally, a trace of curiosity in his eyes. “I didn’t expect to find another cultivator from Qian Nation. If possible, I’d like to meet them later.”
The big black ox’s expression shifted slightly upon hearing this. No wonder the northern beasts were so formidable—it turned out the Baili Clan had sent them over...
That said, the Baili Clan had been quite honest. In the recorded history of the Qian Nation’s cultivation world, those northern beasts had never invaded human territory. Perhaps they still remembered the debt of gratitude for saving their lives.
