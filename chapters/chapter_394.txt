Li Xizhi, bewitched by Daoist Master Buzi's divine ability, collapsed onto the desk with a thud, losing all consciousness and senses, and sinking into a deep darkness. However, the Talisman Seed in his Qihai acupoint stirred, allowing him to vaguely break free from the divine ability's restraint and hear some sounds.
Yuan Tuan's voice was gentle and warm.
"Junior pays respects to the Daoist Master."
Yuan Tuan lifted her gaze, forcing herself to remain calm as she greeted the man. The green-robed Daoist in front of her simply glanced at her sideways, then sat cross-legged and picked up a jade teapot.
Gurgle, gurgle…
Emerald green tea flowed into the cup. Daoist Master Buzi did not respond immediately but poured himself some tea before saying, "Azure Crest Manifestation is indeed a high grade ancient technique. You have wasted so much time on it... We did not expect you to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, so it seems you have your own fortune. Not bad."
"Thank you for the praise, Ancestor," Yuan Tuan replied obediently.
Gentle breezes blew into the pavilion as the Daoist and the female cultivator sat facing each other. Daoist Master Buzi rolled up his sleeves, took a sip of tea, and continued, "What did you gain?"
Yuan Tuan's heart skipped a beat. She feigned ignorance, frowning as she asked, "What do you mean, Daoist Master?"
Daoist Master Buzi chuckled, his gaze sharp and his voice turning cold.
"Did you not secretly go to Cloud Crowned Peak to seek a Dao scripture? I'm just wondering which Dao scripture the Yuan Family wants… Is it the Heavenly Night Badger Scripture or Clear Clouds Scripture?"
He squinted at Yuan Tuan's submissive demeanor, pondering to himself, Azure Crest Manifestation protects the mind and spirit, and dispels disasters… I wonder how much my divine ability can influence her.
Yuan Tuan, being in the Foundation Establishment Realm, was not as easy to manipulate as Li Xizhi beside her. Daoist Master Buzi stared at her and said in a low voice, "It certainly cannot be Aged Courtly Path Scripture or River Mountain Sutra, which are beyond the Yuan Family's capability. Do not bring trouble upon yourself."
Daoist Master Buzi's words were full of warning, causing Yuan Tuan to hurriedly bow her head in apology. She was about to speak, but Buzi abruptly interrupted her.
"But the former two are also acceptable!"
He swirled his jade cup gently and said in a warm tone, "Your ancestor Yuan Licheng was brought up by me. If he could find the Clear Clouds Scripture, he may re-enter the sect as the master of Qingsui Peak and become a Daoist Master of the Azure Pond Sect after breaking through to the Purple Mansion Realm."
"That was how Tang Yuanwu and Si Boxiu rejoined. Having Yuan Licheng follow their path won't a problem… This is the sincerity of our Azure Pond Sect."
Buzi put down the jade cup and, seeing Yuan Tuan's contemplative look, smiled as he continued, "Not everyone can be as resourceful as Xiao Chuting, walking along the edge of a cliff day and night. Look, despite his strength, how well has the Xiao Family been doing these past few years?"
"Thank you for the guidance, Daoist Master…" Yuan Tuan responded.
Only then did Daoist Master Buzi turn his gaze to the unconscious Li Xizhi, speaking in a low voice, "A member of the Li Family?"
"Indeed," Yuan Tuan answered.
Hearing her affirmative answer, Buzi looked at Li Xizhi with interest with an unreadable smile on his face.
"There is one more thing: years ago, Si Yuanbai claimed he himself obtained the Dao of the Supreme Yin Moonlight and gave it to his disciple Li Chejing. We thought he was foolish for not using such a valuable thing himself, but could not question him because of Si Boxiu."
"Thinking about it now…" Daoist Master Buzi paused as he stared coldly at Li Xizhi and spoke softly, "Si Yuanbai may be honest but he's not stupid. It should be the Li Family that obtained the Supreme Yin Moonlight, and decided to give it to Li Chejing with Si Yuanbai's help to cover it up."
His long fingers beckoned, and the collapsed Li Xizhi suddenly sat up, dazed and vacant-eyed. Daoist Master Buzi asked softly, "Where did the Li Family get the Supreme Yin Moonlight?"
Li Xizhi seemed bewitched by his divine ability, stammering out a story about how the Li Family had gained access to a cave dwelling on Meiche Peak, obtained the Supreme Yin Moonlight, and let Li Chejing bring it back to the sect. The logic was seamless, making Daoist Master Buzi nod slightly.
"That makes sense… A small family getting one Supreme Yin Moonlight is fortunate enough. How could they have a second one?"
Daoist Master Buzi, needing this Supreme Yin Moonlight for alchemy, tried his luck and sighed regretfully upon hearing this, murmuring quietly, "Maybe I will find another opportunity to search Moongaze Lake. Perhaps there might be more."
He rose from his seat, brushed his sleeves, and adjusted his shoes and socks under the curtain by the entrance before leaving on his own.
Yuan Tuan remained silent by the desk for a long while before slowly exhaling. She then awakened Li Xizhi, speaking gently, "Xizhi!"
Li Xizhi pretended to be confused, but with the Talisman Seed protecting him, he had been awake for a while. He had deliberately revealed some information, having heard the Azure Pond Sect's promises to the Yuan Family, and silently noted it in his heart.
The Li Family, Wutu Peak.
Li Yuanjiao let out a long breath, his cultivation gradually stabilizing. After months of seclusion last year, he had successfully broken through to the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Now, after half a year of silent cultivation, his progress was steady.
With a few more years of accumulation, he could easily break through to the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. With the help of the talisman pill, the Foundation Establishment Realm was within reach.
The past two years had been relatively stable, though there were still some devil cultivators in Mushroom Forest Plain. The number was not large, but the Purple Smoke Gate north of Lixia Prefecture began to suffer attacks from devil cultivators. The rumors seemed true; the group of devil cultivators who previously besieged Cloud Crowned Peak feared the Xiao Family's retaliation and dared not stay long, mostly moving north.
Many had died in Mushroom Forest Plain, but since it was the Yuan Family's backyard, they could not allow any devil cultivators to wreak havoc.
Yuan Licheng, the peak Foundation Establishment Realm ancestor of the Yuan Family, personally led four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to sweep out the devil cultivators, driving out the rest, and bringing stability back to Mushroom Forest Plain.
The Li, Yu, and Fei families behind Moongaze Lake, nestled between Lixia Prefecture and Mushroom Forest Plain, were shielded by the Xiao and Yuan families and thus suffered no losses. They even gained considerable benefits.
First, rogue cultivators, fearing the devil cultivators, retreated to Moongaze Lake or to Mount Dali to establish their own Dao lineages, or temporarily resided among the various families scattered around Moongaze Lake. Some rogue cultivators, after fleeing, grew tired of wandering and submitted to the Li Family as guest cultivators.
Second, the destruction of the Cloud Crowned Market left many rogue cultivators without a place to trade their materials. With devil cultivators rampant, travel became unsafe, forcing them to sell their goods cheaply to the nearest clans.
Li Yuanjiao's half-year seclusion saw many changes in the family. Li Yuanping visited Mount Wutu to sort out the family's affairs, reporting, "In Eastern Mount Yue, there are sixty-five Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators in total. They tend to the spirit fields, yielding 1,400 jin of Spirit Paddies annually, valued at about twenty Spirit Stones along with other spirit items."
"Our own Lijing, Huaqian, Huazhong, and Yuting Peaks have over seventy Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators. After deducting wages, they produce 1,600 jin annually, valued at twenty-five Spirit Stones with other spirit items!"
Li Yuanping, looking very pleased, continued with a smile, "Our family now makes a yearly profit of forty-five Spirit Stones. Over five years, that is two hundred and twenty-five spirit stones, enough to cover the tribute to the Azure Pond Sect!"
Li Yuanping, who had racked his brains to balance the family's income and expenses, was pleased to finally see the accounts balanced. His complexion looked much healthier now.
After all, the Li Family was now a large and prosperous one, and the expenses needed to maintain it were astronomical. This wave of rogue cultivators fleeing to them had helped alleviate the burden somewhat.
Li Yuanjiao also showed a hint of joy, and Li Yuanping continued, "There are ten unrefined Qi Cultivators of Mount Yue who do not possess much combat strength… They mostly handle transportation and errands within the clan. Five family cultivators and external unrefined Qi Cultivators have also been assigned to various positions. As for the Qi Cultivation Realm, we have an additional guest cultivator, also surnamed Li, named Li Qilang. He is at the second heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm. Originally, he was running errands in Mushroom Forest Plain, but upon hearing about the Li Family at Moongaze Lake, he came over to join us."
True Qi Cultivators among the rogue cultivators were few, so recruiting one was quite a success. Li Yuanjiao did not mind and set his sword down. Li Yuanping then continued, saying, "I have already sent people to the Yuan Family to purchase the spirit springs. Although it will cost some money, we can plant the Wanglin Blossom sooner and not delay it any longer."
