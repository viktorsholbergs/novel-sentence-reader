Is the 90-point spiritual energy enhancement really increasing exponentially? He can't sense it for the time being at his current level.
However, he has some understanding of strength. It's definitely not just 90 times the strength of an ordinary person or 90 times the strength of his current body; it's definitely more! But his understanding of his own physical strength is limited, and he hasn't carefully sensed it with body refining techniques yet.
He can only put it aside for now; no rush. There's no deep-seated grudge to settle, no inexplicable enemies wanting to come knocking...
And the Jade Spirit Scripture seems to have been repaired by spiritual energy enhancement, mutating in an unpredictable direction, like a large fireball spell.
Originally, it was to condense two-tenths of the spiritual energy within the body, but now it seems to be purifying the impurities within the spiritual energy.
"Could it be that spiritual roots also have a concept of purity? There's no such saying here..."
Chen Xun is still muttering to himself, saying some inexplicable things.
The big black ox immediately starts taking out a small booklet to record. Although it doesn't understand, Chen Xun is unconscious right now.
It's afraid that Chen Xun might forget when he wakes up, so recording it is the best, just like when they were learning medicine.
Days pass, and Chen Xun still shows no signs of waking up.
The big black ox squats in the distance, motionless, with a floating booklet in front of it, ready to record if he suddenly speaks.
They've heard about it in the Five Elements Sect. Senior cultivators who are cultivating in seclusion may spend ten or dozens of years, feeling no passage of time.
There's also a ridiculous joke: A senior cultivator emerged from seclusion, not knowing what year it was, only to find out in the end that his lifespan was running out!
He left today, and fellow cultivators from various sects came to offer condolences and have a feast.
Today, the sky above the Imperial City is extremely gloomy, with lead-gray clouds pressing down so heavily that people can hardly breathe, as black as ink.
Countless fallen leaves flutter around the cave, rustling.
"Moo~" The big black ox is completely focused, with only Chen Xun in its eyes. The defensive array around the cave has long been activated, so even if it rains heavily, it won't affect us here.
The low rumbling has never stopped, and the spiritual energy inside Chen Xun's body has officially begun to sublimate. The five spiritual energy chains around him become heavier and heavier, hovering around him.
The big black ox's eyes widened. After hundreds of years, they may have really found a treasure!
Although this kind of auxiliary technique may be a form of self-sabotage for other cultivators who know that they're immortals and that there's no end to the road ahead,.
Chen Xun is still wandering in the sea of spiritual energy. His brows furrow slightly, and there are major issues with this technique. It's definitely not something an ordinary person can cultivate.
Condensing two-tenths of the spiritual energy within the body, it's feasible in the Foundation Establishment stage, Core Formation stage, and Nascent Soul stage. This itself is a trap.
This will exponentially increase the difficulty of breaking through oneself, not just two-tenths. At that time, that old man didn't make it clear; the emphasis was on equal strength at the same level.
It's like you can break through with one Foundation Establishment Pill, but after practicing this technique, you may need several pills to break the shackles.
But for Chen Xun, this is not a problem. He's not lacking in spiritual herbs. His focus is...
Damn it, the auction! There must be a plant!!!
I bought it wrong!!
"Moo?!"
The big black ox's pupils shrink sharply. Why does the spiritual energy around Chen Xun suddenly seem a bit violent, with sand and rocks flying around as if it's angry?
However, there's still no sign of waking up. The big black ox completely understands. This is not a trivial spell that can be cast at will.
Days go by, and the championships have come to an end, quite splendidly. Among them, several individuals have risen.
And there's one person who came from a small sect, shining in the Foundation Establishment stage battle of elites, directly catching the attention of the Top Ten Sects, extending an olive branch.
They didn't really pressure others. They only asked if he was willing to come to the sect for cultivation. Behind the scenes, they even provided many cultivation resources to that small sect.
They said: Even if he is unwilling to come, nurturing such elites is a blessing to our Qian Nation. We should reward them.
The Foundation Establishment prodigy was deeply moved. Even the people from the sect urged him to go quickly, just come back whenever he has time; there's no deep-seated grudge to bear.
Later, he unexpectedly joined the Pill Cauldron Sect, saying he's willing to contribute to the Qian Nation and the major sects, and he threw himself into alchemy.
This event can also be considered a perfect ending to the battle of the prodigies.
Those small sects all praised the actions of the Top Ten Sects. This is true magnanimity and broad-mindedness, worthy of being called the best sects!
But the most exciting part is still the Flower Festival.
With celestial music lingering in the air and countless fireworks blooming, numerous flower lanterns flow along the long river. The fairies from the Moon-Embracing Pavilion come by boat, inviting countless prodigies to board the boats and enjoy the moonlight.
It can be said to be a gathering of talented men and beautiful women, perfect matches, making countless cultivators standing on the riverbank envious, almost grinding their teeth to pieces.
And the most extraordinary part is yet to come.
Ren Wei stood on the top of the Jade Tower; mists appeared, vague and enchanting. She wore a green veil, ethereal and unparalleled.
The sound of the music flows like running water, actually attracting spiritual birds to fly over and circle the Jade Tower.
Accompanied by a shower of flowers and enveloped in rosy clouds.
Mu Qing from the Purple Cloud Sect, on the other hand, furrows her brows deeply. She really can't lower her dignity and behave like this in front of so many cultivators.
External evaluation: Ren Wei is even better.
Behind is the entrance of the various prodigies into the Jade Tower. Outsiders can no longer catch a glimpse, only standing outside feeling regretful, why aren't they prodigies themselves!
Internal evaluation: Mu Qing's style is even better.
Now it's already been half a year since the end of the first auction.
...
Qin Immortal Mountain, Yellow-grade Cave.
Chen Xun finally showed signs of waking up. The big black ox still squatted in place, writing a few words in the booklet.
Most of them are losses, definitely losses. There's a big plant...
Boom!
Boom!
"Moo!!" The big black ox finally moved, standing up and continuously mooing loudly.
The surrounding scenery seemed to be affected by Chen Xun's spiritual energy, even the fallen leaves were shattered into powder, and the Crane Spirit Trees were inexplicably heavily damaged, suffering the most.
"Old Ox!"
Chen Xun suddenly opened his eyes and instinctively shouted.
Five spiritual energy chains emitted dazzling light of various colors, instantly being retracted into his body, and the terrifying fluctuations disappeared with them.
The sharpness on his body also gradually faded, returning to its original state.
"Moo~Moo!!" The big black ox kept mooing, rushing over, and rubbing against Chen Xun.
It even handed the booklet it wrote to Chen Xun, looking proud.
"Hmm!" Chen Xun patted the big black ox on the back with his hand and carefully checked it, not wanting to miss a word.
Recorded by the big black ox every day, every sentence he said was in it. It's been half a year since they calculated the days.
Chen Xun's eyes flashed with surprise. He unexpectedly didn't feel the passage of time much, this is the first time he's had this feeling.
Before, consolidating his cultivation base, practicing spells, he could always feel the changes in the outside world.
"Old Ox, thank you for your hard work.‚Äù Chen Xun sighed, and a gleam suddenly flashed in his eyes, "However, this thing is destined to me, so I'll take it first."
"Moo?" The big black ox instantly jumped away, its eyes wide with surprise,
"It's mine." Chen Xun's tone was indifferent, hands behind his back, holding the booklet tightly, "Please, don't..."
"Moo!"
Before Chen Xun finished speaking, the big black ox suddenly became furious. This is what it wrote, stroke by stroke. Black Ox charges! Black Ox collides! Black Ox presses down!
"Oh my god! Oh my god!! Oh my god~~!!!"
"Moo!!"
The cave mansion echoed with earth-shattering screams and fighting sounds, accompanied by screams, making the listeners heartbroken and tearful.
