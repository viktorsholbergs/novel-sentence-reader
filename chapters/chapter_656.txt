"A Grade Five Purple Mansion Realm cultivation technique—Radiant Essence Scripture." The weight of these words was immense. Even a fragment of this statement was enough to make one jump to their feet.
Li Xuanxuan's eyes widened as he asked in shock, "A Purple Mansion Realm technique?"
The Li Family wasn't entirely lacking in Purple Mansion Realm techniques. In fact, compared to other regions, Moongaze Lake, due to the Jiang Family's fragmentation, was one of the few places with an unusually rich and complete repository of cultivation techniques.
In other places, such as the Yuan Family's Mushroom Forest Plain or the various prefectures of Azure Pond, it was rare to even have one full technique up to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Even techniques for the Six Chakras of the Embryonic Breathing Realm are divided into six separate sections, forcing cultivators to progress step by step, tightly restricted at every turn. Only in Moongaze Lake, lacking a central authority, could techniques flow more freely. Elsewhere, strict regulation was the norm.
But this was a Purple Mansion Realm technique—a complete and cultivable Purple Mansion Realm technique! It wasn't a fragmented remnant, nor was it a lost art from ancient times.
Even in a world where techniques were tightly controlled, and even in the chaotic free-for-all of the outer seas, Purple Mansion Realm techniques remained the most closely guarded secrets. They were the keys to elevating a family to the status of an immortal sect—a path to ascendancy. No wonder the revelation left the three utterly shaken.
The elder's beard trembled as he hastily grabbed a bamboo slip from the table. The clatter of wooden cases hitting the ground echoed as he snatched up a brush with his other hand and urgently said, "Wei'er, come… write it down immediately!"
His tone was rushed, almost as if he feared the boy would vanish at any moment, adopting a coaxing tone as though speaking to a child. Li Zhouwei obediently took the bamboo slip and, with a small hand guiding the brush, began to write. As he worked, he murmured, "It is a shame… this technique only goes up to the early Purple Mansion Realm and condenses the first… so-called divine ability…"
"It really is a Bright Yang Purple Mansion Realm technique." Li Qinghong's expression showed a trace of envy. Her own cultivation method capped at the late Foundation Establishment Realm. No matter how great her talent, she had no opportunity to even attempt breaking into the Purple Mansion Realm. Her eyes lingered on the bamboo slip, and she softly remarked, "What a great opportunity…"
Li Xijun's face lit up with a joyful smile, his long-suppressed expression finally breaking free. The intricate plans in his mind, which had been disrupted beyond recognition, suddenly didn't matter as he laughed out loud and asked, "Is Ximing still in seclusion? He has got some good luck as well! We have been worrying so much for him, but now it looks like his path is set too."
"You are still thinking about him!" Li Xuanxuan chuckled, though his gaze never left the young boy in front of him. There was something familiar in the child's demeanor and movements, a feeling he couldn't quite place no matter how hard he thought about it.
Before long, Li Zhouwei had finished transcribing the cultivation technique. Li Xuanxuan took the completed transcription and read it carefully from beginning to end, then slowly sat down to the side. A wide smile spread across his wrinkled face.
Clutching the technique, he read through it again, slapping his thigh as he exclaimed, "What a marvelous Grade Five technique! It is truly the Golden Yang Radiant Origin! The Radiant Origin Pass!"
Li Xuanxuan slapped his thigh three times in quick succession, his face full of admiration. The sight made Li Qinghong smirk quietly. She leaned closer to Li Xijun and whispered, "It has been ages since the old man looked this happy. Honestly, I have never seen him like this since I was a child."
The aunt and nephew exchanged knowing smiles. After a long while, Li Xuanxuan finally seemed to snap out of his daze. Noticing the two of them and the child watching him with amusement, he hastily collected himself and spoke solemnly, "Come, all of you, take a look at this!"
Li Qinghong took the transcription and skimmed the earlier sections, focusing her attention on the final parts. These detailed how an Immortal Foundation could nurture and catalyze divine abilities, describing nine different methods, mantras, and the challenges to overcome in achieving them.
She couldn't resist reading aloud the poetic description of the divine abilities, "Flames surge within the heart, illuminating the inner and outer Yang. Thus, the Bright Yang Divine Ability forms. Its brilliance spans nine chi, purple flames flare outward, radiant clouds ascend and dissipate, golden armor and robes materialize across the heavens… The sun blazes red in the east, the earth erupts in the south, traversing the Great Void, refining golden lotuses…"
The Li Family had previously acquired a defunct cultivation technique known as the Aged Courtly Path Scripture, which was also of the Purple Mansion Realm. However, compared to the Radiant Essence Scripture, the Aged Courtly Path Scripture was far shorter in length and entirely lacked such vivid descriptions.
Li Xuanxuan glanced at Li Qinghong's face, which showed a mix of longing and admiration. He remarked, "So many people cultivate, so many reach Foundation Establishment Realm, but how many truly ascend to the Purple Mansion Realm? For such grandeur, only one in countless individuals can succeed."
Li Qinghong smiled faintly and didn't reply. Instead, she asked Li Zhouwei a few questions, confirming that he hadn't received the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra. She then commented softly, "It must be that the Bright Yang constitution conflicts with Supreme Yin. You will just have to cultivate diligently. Zhouwei is a sensible child. It is better not to tell your father about this—it could end up harming him."
As she spoke, her gaze remained fixed on Li Zhouwei's golden eyes, as though trying to gauge his emotions. The boy simply nodded lightly, his expression steady, and said quietly, "Wei'er understands."
He didn't elaborate, but there was a quiet authority in his tone that inspired confidence. Li Qinghong paused briefly, then nodded and replied, "Good." Turning to the others, she said gently, "Let us send Zhouwei down first. We should not keep Chengliao waiting."
Both of them nodded in agreement. Li Xuanxuan took a sip of tea and set his cup down. By the time he did, Li Qinghong had already returned from the hall as swiftly as a bolt of lightning. She stood by his side, her expression now serious.
"This trip back was not just for this matter," she continued in a low voice, "On my way through Green Pine Island, I met with Xizhi. According to news from Azure Pond, Li Encheng of Fuchen Peak is nearing the end of his lifespan and plans to attempt a breakthrough to the Purple Mansion Realm. He is now seeking assistance from our family."
Li Xuanxuan paused in surprise and asked, "That man… Does he even have a Purple Mansion Realm technique?"
Li Qinghong nodded, though her tone carried a trace of worry. "He does not. It is said he has been referencing similar techniques within the sect and concocting some pills on his own, risking everything for a last-ditch attempt before his death."
Li Xuanxuan's expression darkened with frustration. "We asked him to handle something for us, and he has not even finished the task. Now he is planning to die? What a waste of effort."
Li Qinghong nodded. She seemed to share his sentiment as she added, "Not just that. According to Xizhi, Li Encheng has not been of much help with family matters anyway. All this back-and-forth…"
From her sleeve, she produced a jade scroll densely packed with requests. "He is asking for rare medicinal herbs and spirit water, promising rewards after his breakthrough. But everyone knows the likelihood of success is slim to none. It is just a one-way trip."
Li Xijun accepted the jade scroll and read through it carefully. Items like Tongyuan Water and Changshan Spirit Stone were listed, totaling dozens of valuable resources. At the end, in small handwriting, there was an additional note, "If clues to Heavenly Pure Essence can be found, the rewards will be significant."
Li Xuanxuan glanced at the jade scroll and let out a derisive laugh, commenting, "If we truly possessed something as rare as Heavenly Pure Essence, would we simply hand it over to him? Preposterous!"
