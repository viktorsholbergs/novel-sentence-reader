“How is this possible?!”
“What kind of Nascent Soul is this?!”
The two were horrified as if they had just witnessed the most unimaginable scene. How could anyone's Nascent Soul be this large?
Little Red's body stiffened abruptly; his eyes widened in shock, speechless with astonishment. The Ghost Infant was already bizarre enough, but Brother Xun's Nascent Soul was even more outrageous.
So, this was Brother Xun's true strength. Fighting two at once, he completely overpowered them. Little Red let out a breath of relief, almost thinking they were done for.
“A mere mid-stage Nascent Soul, and you dare act all mysterious before me.”
A cold, indifferent voice suddenly sounded behind the two black-robed figures. Their souls flickered, and their Dao hearts trembled as they stiffly turned to look behind them.
“Damn it, we’re just fishermen! We haven’t provoked any of you!” Chen Xun stood between them, gripping their heads with both hands, and suddenly roared in fury, “Think carefully about how to properly cultivate!”
With that, Chen Xun forcefully pressed down in mid-air.
Whoosh!
BOOM!!!
The three of them plummeted like meteors. The earth resounded with the loud cracking of the ground and the sound of skulls shattering. The fractured ground even extended to the distant sea, forming two massive trenches.
The ground was instantly smashed into a large crater. The eyes of the two black-robed figures exploded, filthy blood splattering across the sky. Their magical power and Nascent Souls were completely suppressed, leaving them immobilized and in unbearable pain.
Little Red’s fur was blown wildly by the fierce winds, his eyes wide in utter shock at the sight before him...
“Moo!!”
The big black ox bellowed, and all the black-robed figures had already entered the formation. None of them could escape.
“Aaah!!~”
“Our master!!!”
From the sea, anguished cries echoed. They were trapped by chains of the Five Elements, the grand formation even burning their souls. Their divine tools were utterly useless.
“Old Ox, Little Red, set up the Ascension Formation!”
“Moo!”
“On it, Brother Xun!”
They soared into the air, taking their positions in three directions, with 108 incense burners encircling the area. All the black-robed figures had unknowingly entered the illusory Ascension Formation, completely unaware.
“Fellow Daoist... it’s our fault for not recognizing your greatness. Please forgive us!” The old woman, covered in blood, weakly cried out, “We are from the Hall of Lost Souls. Killing us won't bring you any benefit.”
Her expression was utterly grim. After cultivating for a thousand years, she had encountered such a terrifying figure. The sense of helplessness was like standing before the hall master.
“Forgiveness is the Buddha's business. We only send people to meet the Buddha.” Chen Xun sneered, holding two fingers before his chest. “Brothers, let’s do it! Send them into an eternal dream. Their weak flesh and blood shall ascend to immortality!”
The big black ox and Little Red both nodded. Spiritual energy surged within the incense burners, and they began chanting scriptures.
“Ah!!!”
Inside the formation, dozens of black-robed figures started to emit black smoke from their heads. Regret and terror filled their eyes. Why did they provoke these people!!!
The remaining flesh on their bodies slowly evaporated. As for the Ghost Infant, it seemed to be pierced by something, gradually dissipating.
As the three of them chanted faster, the screams of the black-robed figures grew louder and louder. They weren’t dead yet!
After exchanging a glance, they simultaneously unleashed their spiritual energy towards one point, shouting in unison, “Send these fellow Daoists to ascension!!”
BOOM!
BOOM!
All the black-robed figures exploded. No blood mist spread; nothing remained, as if everything had been completely obliterated. Their souls were absolved, leaving no chance for rebirth.
Little Red, quick on his feet, immediately collected the storage rings. Waste not, want not. He was still using a storage pouch, after all.
The big black ox waved its hoof, and a loud explosion echoed across the sea.
Five small boats were blown to smithereens. They had arrived perfectly fine, but now... there was no going back.
They sat back by the shore, enjoying the raging wind and rain on the sea, as if nothing had happened, each more relaxed than the other.
Little Red's admiration for his two big brothers was beyond words. They were so reliable, his sense of security was off the charts!
“Old Ox, are you hurt?” Chen Xun looked at the big black ox up and down. “You truly are my brother, handling three evil cultivators with ease.”
“Moo~~” The big black ox glanced at Chen Xun with pride. Of course!
“Brother Xun, Brother Ox, what do we do with these storage rings?”
Little Red stood on a chair, holding dozens of storage rings, but they were all sealed with restrictions, and he didn’t dare open them recklessly.
“Moo!” The big black ox waved its hoof. "Let me handle it!" After all, it had been a long time since the Five Elements Unsealing Technique was used—it was a specialist in breaking seals.
Before long, the seals on the storage rings were perfectly undone, releasing wisps of black smoke—clearly, these were not good things.
“Moo~” The big black ox's eyes widened. The seals on the storage rings were actually traps. If they had been forcefully broken, it would have caused an injury, and the storage rings might have been destroyed.
“Oh.”
Chen Xun had already extended his spiritual sense into the rings. Little Red set up a protective shield of spiritual energy around them, shielding them from the wind and rain.
Inside there were many sea charts, things that couldn’t be bought anywhere else, with detailed maps of various factions' island distributions.
Little Red pulled out a few cultivation techniques, his eyelids twitching madly. They were all techniques for using people to cultivate, such as refining a cultivator’s Golden Core and Nascent Soul or suppressing resentment and evil energy.
“As expected, they’re evil cultivators.” Chen Xun glanced at the techniques. “No wonder their cultivation turns them into neither humans nor ghosts. Only the vast sea could harbour such people.”
“Moo~~” The big black ox snorted, picking up a strange, sinister formation book and reading it with great interest.
The storage rings contained a significant amount of spirit stones and spirit herbs—there were over two hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones, most of them water-attributed. Who knows how many cultivators they had robbed?
“Brother Xun, we’ve struck gold!!” Little Red cried out in amazement. He had never seen so many spirit stones in his life. “There are so many spirit herbs and pill recipes too! This is unbelievable!”
“These Nascent Soul evil cultivators must have been in this sea for at least a thousand years. These are all their life savings.” Chen Xun chuckled as he continued sorting through the items. “Little Red, do you understand what it means to stand up for the weak and fight the strong? That’s our duty.”
“Got it, Brother Xun!” Little Red excitedly ran around in circles. He’d been around for a thousand years and had never had anything.
Upon hearing about the spirit stones, the big black ox stopped reading the formation book, its eyes widening in delight. It seemed they had indeed hit the jackpot—instant riches!
“Little Red, take out the booklet you made in the city and copy the sea charts.”
“Got it, Brother Xun!”
“Old Ox, go through these cultivation techniques and books. Destroy anything useless. These Nascent Soul cultivators likely have methods for tracking through divine sense or locking onto souls.”
“Moo moo!!”
The big black ox immediately got up and ran around, sorting out all the books from the storage rings.
Chen Xun, meanwhile, was examining five skull-shaped tokens. The Hall of Lost Souls—it sounded like a major evil cultivation faction, possibly with late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators.
Many of the spirit herbs inside were unfamiliar and unique to the ocean, so they decided to keep them for cultivation.
However, there was no information regarding the Soul Transformation stage. That realm was far beyond the reach of ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators.
Time passed as they continued sorting through the contents of the storage rings by the shore.
The sky had not yet brightened, with only a gray light over the eerily calm sea. The stormy winds and rain of the night felt like a mere illusion.
Suddenly, a distant light appeared in the sky. The clouds seemed to catch fire, and the reflection of the sun on the water was distorted by the waves.
On the shore of a deserted island, three figures continued their work, steadily sorting through the items from the storage rings.
Little Red occasionally let out bursts of laughter as he ran around. Even though the items weren’t his, he was overjoyed for his two brothers. The entire journey had been exhilarating.
The big black ox’s tail was wagging so fast it became a blur. It mooed and laughed heartily, deeply grateful for the evil cultivators' “gifts.” They wouldn't mind doing this a few more times!
Chen Xun sipped his health tea, his gaze fixed on the sunrise with deep thought.
He figured it was time to help Little Red improve his cultivation. It was rare to find such a kindred spirit, and Little Red had never asked for anything along the way.
Meanwhile...
In the vast western sea, there was an island covered by a grand formation. The island was eerie, surrounded by bones—both human and sea beast—radiating intense resentment.
At the center of the island, inside a gloomy ancient hall, a purple-haired man’s eyes blazed with fury.
“Who did this?!!”
His furious voice boomed like thunder, shaking the entire island. Five Nascent Soul cultivators had perished at once; their soul lamps extinguished.
What enraged him the most was that there was no trace left behind—no soul imprints, no clue where they had died. It was utterly infuriating!
The purple-haired man’s eyes flashed with murderous intent, and his aura became increasingly violent. No force could endure the loss of five Nascent Soul cultivators at once.
After a while, he gradually calmed down. This matter had to be investigated in secret. He had no idea which faction was targeting his Hall of Lost Souls, destroying five Nascent Soul cultivators without leaving any trace. Not even he could pull off such a feat.
