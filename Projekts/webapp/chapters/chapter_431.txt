A stream of light emerged from Xianyou Peak and streaked across the sky. After bidding farewell to the Xiao Family, Li Yuanjiao took Li Ximing home.
The youth stood with hands clasped behind him. Clad in a Daoist robe and a medicine pouch at his waist, he gazed down at the mountains below. In front of him, Li Yuanjiao, dressed in his usual black robe, steered through the wind.
"Only a portion of the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi has been gathered. Xijun has decided to take the Cold Pine Snow Qi instead," he said in a solemn voice.
"I see, I'm sorry that he has to go through that…"
Li Ximing's robes fluttered in the wind as he nodded, his fingers caressing the jade beads—Azure Manifestation— around his wrist. The corners of his mouth drooped, hiding a myriad of unspoken thoughts. Yet, he maintained a stoic expression.
Li Yuanjiao was a perceptive person. As he read Li Ximing's expression, discomfort flickered through him as he could not tell what was going through the younger man's mind.
They flew in silence until Mount Lijing loomed below.
Despite being away for several years, Li Ximing still found the mountain familiar. Upon entering the cave dwelling, Li Yuanjiao handed him the jade box containing the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi and a talisman pill.
"You can get the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual from your father," he said.
Li Ximing nodded and respectfully replied, "Ximing won't let everyone down."
As Li Ximing slowly withdrew, Li Yuanjiao remained seated in a daze, his brows knitting tightly together. After a long while, his expression finally softened as he exhaled.
"You've certainly grown up… So grown up that you hide even your mind from your family. If I can't read your thoughts, how can I entrust the Li Family to you?" he muttered with some sadness in his voice.
When they were all but children, I've always thought that Ximing was the affectionate one, while Xijun was the cold one… Now that they've grown up, they both seem impassive, though Xijun shows at least a touch of human emotion.
Li Yuanjiao had discussed the children from the generation of Xi and Yue with Li Yuanping on multiple occasions.
Li Xijun had the best character, and though Li Ximing was capable, he often appeared overly rigid, lacking any notable qualities and occasionally appearing distant.
If Li Ximing had not been the most gifted, blessed with innate talents in alchemy and born of Changhu's lineage, they might well have chosen to entrust the Li Family to Li Xijun instead.
Yet, seeing the brothers' harmonious relationship, they ultimately decided on Li Ximing since he was a gentle and reasonable child.
Now, observing his demeanor after years away, seeming distant even from his own kin, Li Yuanjiao unfastened his black robe, feeling a weary resignation as he approached the small well in the cave dwelling.
The water shimmered, showing the reflection of fierce eyes that seemed like it was about to pick a victim to be devoured, under eyebrows that were too close to each other.
Li Yuanjiao squinted as he stared at himself in the water for a while.
When I was little, I was Father's least favorite child… I guess he must have been frightened by my appearance.
He eventually looked away, settled down cross-legged, and began to cultivate in solitude.
Li Ximing descended the mountain and walked in silence. The spiritual qi of Mount Lijing paled in comparison to that of Xianyou Peak. Reflecting on his age, he realized he was already sixteen.
I'm at the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm… After taking the talisman pill, I'll reach the sixth stage. It'll take another two or three years to break through, so I should be reaching the Qi Cultivation Realm by eighteen.
Xiao Yuansi had reached the Qi Cultivation Realm at twenty, yet it took him nearly forty more years to break through to the next realm, at the age of sixty. Li Ximing understood the delay all too well.
It's definitely because the Xiao Family requires him to constantly produce pills.
Ancestor Xiao Chuting had been a Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist himself. Even with such a precedent, Xiao Yuansi was still severely hindered. Being a gentle person by nature, Xiao Yuansi dutifully refined pills without complaint.
What about me, then? I'm the only alchemist in the family. As soon as I ignite the Pill Flame, I can start bringing in profits to the family. Even if my family cares about me, I probably won't have much time to cultivate… And on top of that…
Li Ximing had received the letter from home as soon as he had just broken through to the Jade Capital stage and ignited the Pill Flame to refine pills. He tried not to be suspicious, but this timing still chilled his heart.
As he continued walking, he noticed a figure ahead who was standing with a sword in his arms. His eyebrows were sharp like blades and his eyes were bright as the stars—it was Li Xijun.
Li Xijun had already taken the talisman pill and reached the sixth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, making his strength a level higher than Li Ximing. He approached with his sword and said softly, "Brother, it's been too long since you came home. Why the long face?"
Li Ximing looked at him blankly, then suddenly took out a jade box that had flowing golden patterns from his storage pouch. He handed it over with a sigh of relief and said, "I think you should take this."
"The Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi?!"
Li Xijun was stunned, unable to find his voice for a while before he erupted, "Li Ximing! Have you lost your mind?!"
Li Ximing looked much more at ease and explained, "I've given it much thought. Our family needs a steady supply of pills and medicine, so I'll inevitably be spending a lot of time in alchemy. It'd be a waste for me to practice that Grade Four cultivation technique, so I was thinking of letting you have it instead. I'll use a less impressive technique and focus on alchemy. You should be the one overseeing the family."
He paused, then added, "I've observed many alchemists in sects and families being hindered by their craft. Achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm is rare among them… Perhaps I should follow the path my grandfather did. He specialized in drawing talismans instead of chasing after the Foundation Establishment Realm..."
Li Xijun sneered and shot back, "I see, you've thought this through… But your grandfather only focused on drawing talismans because he had no hope of attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm! You, however, clearly are more talented than the rest of us, yet you choose to dedicate yourself to alchemy?!"
He could feel a rising frustration as he continued, "How can a Qi Cultivation Realm alchemist even be compared to a Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist?!"
Gritting his teeth, he continued bluntly, "You're just scared, Li Ximing! The family has pinned so much hope and expectations on you, believing you could be another Xiao Chuting. Yet here you are, overthinking things and trying to escape from all of it!"
Li Ximing, stung by the accusation, flushed and retorted, "So what if I'm trying to escape? It all falls on me, everything depends on me… You speak without feeling the weight! Do you truly think everyone can become like Xiao Chuting? It's impossible to maintain such a pace of cultivation progress while mastering alchemy simultaneously! The world doesn't work that way!"
"I fear I can't juggle alchemy and cultivation simultaneously! What if I die trying to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm? All this precious spiritual qi would be squandered in vain! In that case, I wouldn't even make it as a Qi Cultivation Realm alchemist!" he added, his voice thick with distraught and frustration.
Li Xijun had said what he wanted to say. He shoved the Golden Yang Radiant Origin qi back into Li Ximing's arms and said, "Fine! You'll accompany me up the mountain. We'll tell Second Uncle about this and let him decide!"
Li Ximing slumped onto the ground, clutching the jade box in his arms, and fell silent. Li Xijun let out a long sigh and softened his tone.
"Brother, you shouldn't stress yourself out like this…"
"How can I not?" Li Ximing retorted weakly.
He caressed the jade box on his lap, his voice soft and wistful as he said, "Our high ancestor remained a mortal for twenty years before ultimately achieving the Foundation Establishment Realm. Likewise, our three great ancestors were amazing heroes too. Whenever I read our family history, I just find them so amazing… As a child, I always heard the elders say you are most like them. You are calm, composed, thoughtful, and ruthless," he spoke softly.
