The night was dim, with a drizzle casting a veil over the mountain road. However, Li Jingtian's side courtyard was still brightly lit.
She was bent over her desk, meticulously recording the daily information she gleaned from the elders in town. She paused to count the days.
"According to what the elder from the Chen Family said, Grandfather left home when Great Grandfather was thirty. Twenty-eight years later, upon his return, the Great Grandfather had already passed away... If that's accurate, then Grandfather advanced from a mortal to a cultivator of the Foundation Establishment Realm within twenty-eight years... That's truly remarkable! Even the Fourth Uncle, the most talented in our clan, took thirty years to attain that realm… It's astonishing how swiftly Grandfather progressed with his cultivation."
Li Jingtian recorded this entire timeline but furrowed her brow, feeling that something was amiss.
But if that's true, why did Father claim he began cultivating only at the age of fourteen? If my calculations are correct, he would have attained Profound Scenery Realm in just a matter of months... Perhaps I misremembered, she pondered silently.
Still frowning at the silk fabric page before her, Li Jingtian could not shake the feeling that the history of the past decades was shrouded in a cloak of deception.
Despite the short passage of time, too many crucial details seemed conveniently erased. Her grandfather, Li Mutian, had secluded himself on the mountain for decades when he was alive, leaving her at a loss for material to document.
"How peculiar…"
As Li Jingtian lowered her head in contemplation, a soft knock interrupted her thoughts. Hastily covering the documents with an overturned wooden box, she called out, "Who's there?!"
"It's me."
Li Tongya swept his sleeves grandly as he entered the courtyard, unaffected by the night drizzle. Standing before the house, he remained dry with his arms folded, his expression appearing troubled.
"Ah, Second Uncle, please, come in quickly!"
Startled by his sudden appearance, Li Jingtian hurried to welcome him.
Li Tongya waved her off, then gently but firmly pushed her back into the house. He followed suit and entered the room, settling by the desk. Picking up the wooden slips on it, he read them before nodding in approval.
"You've done a good job."
Li Jingtian lowered her gaze respectfully, awaiting further instruction. Li Tongya lowered his voice and said, "I've come to discuss an important matter with you."
"It's about our clan's history. Since it concerns confidential information, I want it to be split into two volumes—one will be called 'Internal History', to be kept in the ancestral hall away from the other disciples, and the other will be called "Family History", which you can document like usual. I will read the points out, and you'll write them down."
Li Jingtian nodded obediently and reached for her brush as Li Tongya began reciting the account.
As they worked in tandem, time seemed to blur. Li Jingtian's complexion shifted from curiosity to shock.
While she struggled with complex concepts such as the Reception Method and talisman seeds, the allusions to the schemes of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators left her trembling.
Finally, Li Tongya concluded, "...Chejing diligently cultivated and eventually reached the Foundation Establishment Realm. With his remarkable talents, he successfully condensed a sword intent known as the 'Celestial Moon'... With it, he defeated Chi Zhiyun, sending shockwaves through many sects. Even so, the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the Azure Pond Sect proceeded to send him to the great flood dragon of the southern border… where he was refined into a pill."
Relying on his own carefully reasoned deductions, Li Tongya pieced together a narrative that closely mirrored the actual truth.
Li Jingtian's brush faltered as she grasped the implications. Looking up in disbelief, she murmured, "Fourth Uncle…was refined into a pill?! T-That's…!"
Li Tongya watched her silently, waiting for her to wipe away her tears and regain her composure before continuing, "That was what happened. You must carefully craft the family history based on the internal history… Make sure you obscure any discrepancies. Do not divulge details about using the Reception Method to receive talisman seeds, and adjust the cultivation progress to appear more reasonable."
"Take great care in your writing, make sure there are no loopholes. Include the part about Jing'er's venture into the southern border, lest anyone grow suspicious," he instructed sternly.
"Understood…" Li Jingtian responded with a heavy heart.
Li Tongya rose from his seat and issued another instruction, "Draft a copy and deliver it to me first. For the time being, refrain from venturing outside. Jing'er's affairs need not be shared with others."
After exiting the courtyard, Li Tongya soared into the air and departed. Jingtian saw him off and bowed respectfully.
She waited in silence for a few moments, gazing up at the dark sky when only the sound of the whistling wind remained in the courtyard. She wiped the tears that had gathered in the corners of her eyes before slowly returning to her room, still in a daze.
Lu Sisi returned to Mount Huaqian only to find the foot of the mountain covered in red.
The banquet tables were so plentiful that they stretched all the way to the entrance of the village, and laughter filled the air as the children and grandchildren of him and his siblings indulged in the feast.
With not much remaining time to seek solutions for the Lu Family's plight, Lu Sisi's heart swelled with anger at the sight of his family members enjoying their wine and singing happily.
He landed at the foot of the mountain and saw a Qi Cultivator of his family, Lu Yuanlu, holding a beautiful woman in each hand. He was dressed in shimmery gold lavish clothes and seemed rather pleased with himself.
A man lay bloodied at his feet as he raised his wine cup high, singing loudly.
The music halted abruptly as soon as Lu Sisi descended into the crowd, and all eyes turned to him. They lowered their heads glumly at the interruption.
Lu Yuanlu cast a glance at him, then kicked away the servant at his feet.
"Welcome back, Old Ancestor. Would you like to join us for a few drinks?" he asked loudly.
Despite Lu Yuanlu's disrespectful demeanor, Lu Sisi suppressed his anger and remained silent. Yet, he could not help but feel a pang of sorrow.
This child has always been impulsive and arrogant. I don't have many years left in this world, and the family will have to depend on him. If I were to humiliate him now, he would surely hold a grudge. He might seek retribution after I'm dead and long gone, and that would make an ugly sight… I guess I'll go along with him for now.
Reluctantly, Lu Sisi forced a smile, his aging features contorting into an expression of false cheer.
"Sure, I'll have a few cups," he replied stoically.
Lu Yuanlu burst into laughter at the old man's response, and the music swelled with renewed vigor. Lu Sisi settled into his seat, but as the revelry continued, his heart ached with emptiness and bitterness.
He clenched his teeth in frustration as he silently blamed himself for such an outcome.
Go on, sing, and drink to your heart's content! How many more days of such bliss remain? It's all my fault for neglecting to guide you properly… I was too focused on cultivating in seclusion when I was young and failed to keep all of you on a tight leash. I always thought that I had hope in attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm and couldn't afford to waste any time. It was my neglect that raised all of you into such incompetent fools!
Waving away the well-wishers who came over with their wine cups, Lu Sisi lifted his head and stared at the sky for a while before murmuring to himself, "Who is that?"
As the music went on, three streaks of lights appeared in the sky and came to a stop above Mount Huaqian.
The assembled crowd watched in astonishment as a commanding voice echoed down from above.
"Get your ass over here, Lu Sisi!"
Startled, Lu Sisi snapped to attention, rising to the air to face the three visitors immediately.
Before him stood a young man dressed in brocade, flanked by a tall man and a chubby man. The young man shut his eyes and remained silent while his two companions glared at him, sizing him up.
"Ah, it's you, Young Master Yu! Apologies for not welcoming you on time!"
"So… you are Lu Sisi!"
Lu Sisi's heart sank at the question. He swiftly composed himself, forcing a gracious smile as he bowed, extending an invitation for the three visitors to land at the foot of the mountain.
However, Young Master Yu merely shot him a disdainful glance. With an air of superiority, he declared, "My Yu Family is newly affiliated with the Azure Pond Sect. We have not had the pleasure of meeting our neighbors until now… Our disciples have established themselves at Yuanwu Peak within the sect. So, my father thought it would be a great time to meet everyone. I hope you won't turn down his invitation, old man."
"I... I...," Lu Sisi stammered before letting out a sigh. His shock was palpable as he scrambled to ingratiate himself.
"The esteemed stature of a Foundation Establishment Clan is one that Sisi admires. Yu Family's wish is Sisi's comma-…"
Before he could finish speaking, Young Master Yu raised a hand to interrupt him. He rolled his eyes, shaking his head impatiently before saying, "From now on, the Yu Family will have the final say on Moongaze Lake! I have visited all the families surrounding Moongaze Lake, and they all defer to the leadership of the Yu Family. Does the Lu Family have any objections?"
"No, of course not! I dare not! The Lu Family will also follow the leadership of the Yu Family. I dare not entertain any doubts," Lu Sisi replied hastily with a smile, his tone deferential.
A small smile finally graced Young Master Yu's lips, betraying his satisfaction. The glares from his two companions were replaced by silent sneers.
"Excellent!" Young Master Yu exclaimed triumphantly.
His tone turned cold as he continued, "Since the Lu Family is so smart, I guess you know that this involves paying tributes as well. I understand that your family has a connection to Moon Lake Peak, so we won't do anything to you. Whatever tributes you submit to the Azure Pond Sect every five years, you shall submit the same to the Yu Family."
After a slight pause, Young Master Yu lowered his gaze and narrowed his eyes at the pale-faced Lu Sisi. He chuckled darkly and asked, "That won't be a problem, right?"
