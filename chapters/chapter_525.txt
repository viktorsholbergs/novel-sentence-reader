The Eastern Sea spanned thousands of li, with jagged rocks jutting out across its vast expanse. Waves surged endlessly from the boundless east, one after another, crashing upon each other. The islands scattered across the horizon were linked, their landscapes vastly different from those inland. The brilliant morning sun began to rise from the edge of the sky, casting rays of light in all directions.
It was Li Qinghong's first time venturing overseas, and she was deeply captivated by the sight. Unable to hold herself back, she asked, "Is this the end of the world… where immortals reside?"
Kong Yu stroked his beard with a smile and replied, "If you travel eastward all the way to the edge of the Eastern Sea, you will reach the Endless Void Abyss. There, the seawater reverses and falls into the abyss, descending slower and slower until it becomes vapor, rising back up and returning to the sea."
Taking a moment to recount the past, Kong Yu continued, "There is no air, no spiritual qi, nor the great void. That place is called Outer Heavens. In ancient times, cultivators and members of the demon race embarked on journeys to the Outer Heavens from the four seas, and none have ever returned."
Li Yuanjiao nodded. He had heard about this from Li Xizhi before and now asked, "If that is the case... why would anyone go there?"
Kong Yu sighed with a touch of sentiment. "When a cultivator attains the Golden Core Realm, they gain Fruition Attainment and can replace heaven's will with their own. Beyond that is the Dao Embryo, but what lies beyond the Dao Embryo? There is no path left to take...
"It is said that in the past, it was impossible to leave. The four seas were bound by a heavenly barrier. But during the immortal-devil war at Pingming Ford, the heavens lowered by three zhang, and the earth rose by nine chi. Since then, the four seas became unbound, and the practice of cultivation became unrestricted. It is said that those with Dao Embryos sense that the true path lies in the Outer Heavens, so they journey there."
Li Yuanjiao silently nodded, while Kongheng, who had been listening intently, spoke up. "So that is how the immortal sects view it… Our Buddhist sect holds a different perspective."
He had an awkward look on his face and apologized first for what he was about to say. "According to our scriptures, the battle at Pingming Ford is referred to as the Karmic Filth of Past Lives, marking the division between the previous and future incarnations of the Buddha. In the past, immortals and their laws ruled the world, with the Xia people reigning supreme. In the future life, the rise of Buddhism followed, as the Hu and Jie people replaced the Xia."[1]
Kongheng had spoken cautiously, yet the faces of the group still darkened. Kong Yu, however, seemed to reflect on it thoughtfully and remarked, "After the battle of Pingming Ford, the Wei State was destroyed, and the states of Qi, Liang, Zhou, and Yan rose and fell—all under the rule of the Hu and Jie people… Perhaps the Buddha's words were a prophecy of fate."
Kong Yu gave a wry smile and murmured softly, "Five hundred years ago, the southern immortal mansions still had dreams of reclaiming the northern lands. But after the fall of several immortal mansions, all that is left is infighting in their own small corners. The Buddha's words were not entirely wrong! Immortal law has collapsed, and what remains in the south are the paths of devils!"
The Profound Peak disciples behind them exchanged puzzled looks, and one of them asked, "Master's words do not make sense. We vanquish demons and eliminate evil, enjoying the freedom of the heavens and earth… How does that connect to devil paths?"
Kong Yu's face was filled with bitterness. He tightened his grip on the wooden staff and glanced at Li Yuanjiao before sighing. "All of you are still young… You do not understand the ways of the world yet. It is not just about vanquishing demons and eliminating evil. Take one wrong step, and you too will become a devil yourself. And as for the freedom you speak of... there is no such thing."
The disciples, some thoughtful, others defiant, remained silent. Kongheng chanted a Buddhist prayer, his face filled with compassion, as if deeply resonating with the sentiment.
Li Yuanjiao, observing Kongheng's demeanor, surmised that the Profound Peak Gate had likely either been coerced or willingly participated in some unsavory deeds during the devil plague. He shook his head slightly and said in a gentle voice, "Your gate has done rather well under the circumstances."
Kong Yu chuckled grimly and pointed ahead, changing the subject with a smile, "Up ahead is Splitreed Island, the first landing point of the Eastern Sea!"
The Eastern Sea was divided into five major regions. Beyond Lake Xian lay the Crimson Reef Sea, a region full of jagged rocks and home to countless islands. Looking ahead, the group saw a huge island rising in the distance.
This island was vast, covered with various pavilions and towers. Countless cultivators flew up and down, and in the distance, parts of the island were hidden within clouds and mist, its full extent unknown.
Kong Yu smiled and said, "This place is called Splitreed Island. The fire veins here are astonishingly active, surpassing even the volcanic deserts… It is one of the great wonders of the Eastern Sea."
The group was filled with awe, and the Profound Peak disciples bombarded Kong Yu with questions. The old man beamed with pride as he explained, "The island gets its name from Immortal Yingze of the Moonlight Origin Mansion. Legend has it that the immortal captured the Lesser Yang Devil Monarch here, known as Kuaili!
"This Devil Monarch had attained the Lesser Yang Fruition Attainment, becoming undying and indestructible. The immortal, unable to fully destroy him, forced him to reincarnate and start his cultivation anew. Using a white jade hairpin, the immortal divided him into three parts.
"One part was cast into a place known as Beiming, where it transformed into a woman known as the Empress Beiyao. Another part was thrown into the western Great Western Plains, becoming the Devil Lord Xiyan. The last part sank to the bottom of the Eastern Sea, where it was claimed by the Dragon Clan, now known as the Dragon Monarch Xiyang of the Eastern Sea."
Li Yuanjiao, both astonished and unsettled by what he heard, silently reflected on the culture of the Eastern Sea. Such stories would never be spoken of so openly in the Azure Pond Sect, yet here in the Eastern Sea, they were freely shared.
He could only ask, "Are all three of them Golden Core Realm cultivators?"
Kong Yu replied, "It is known that Empress Beiyao and the Dragon Monarch are both Golden Core Realm cultivators, but the one in the Great Western Plains is merely a legend..."
"If that is true... that means a single Lesser Yang Fruition Attainment was split into three Golden Cores, and all three became Golden Core Realm cultivators?"
One of the Profound Peak disciples then asked in confusion, "How is that possible?"
Kong Yu chuckled and answered, "What does a brat like you possibly understand? Back in the day, the nine offspring of the Converging Water Hornless Dragon were born from the dissolution of a single Golden Core into nine, each forming its own Golden Core… The mysteries of the Golden Core are far beyond the grasp of small cultivators like you!"
The group started chattering and discussing this. After a while, a female cultivator approached, radiating joy. She was dressed in a pale yellow-green feather robe and was riding on pink clouds. She first greeted Kong Yu as she cupped her fist, "Greetings, Clan Uncle!"
She then turned eagerly to Li Yuanjiao and said, "Brother Jiao, you are here! What a coincidence! Come with me, let's rest over there."
The group of young disciples followed Kong Yu and were led away for their training. Kong Tingyun glanced at Li Qinghong with surprise and admiration in her eyes. She then smiled and said, "So, this is Sister Qinghong... your reputation precedes you."
She exchanged a few friendly words, clearly taking a liking to Li Qinghong. The group landed at the Profound Peak Gate's station, where Kong Tingyun said, "Would you like to rest for a bit, or head quickly to the marketplace out in the deep sea? Situ Mo is treacherous and devious. If I stay away too long, something might happen..."
Li Yuanjiao and the others were just as eager to get moving, so they all agreed and flew off together. Li Yuanjiao, not wanting to miss a chance to gather more information, asked, "When Senior shared the story of Splitreed Island, he talked about Empress Beiyao and Dragon Monarch Xiyang as if they appear often… Do the Golden Core Realm True Monarchs often reveal themselves overseas?"
"They do not appear all the time, but they do show up occasionally… Overseas, we can speak more freely... They are unlike the Pristine Water True Monarch, who has not dared to show his face for over a century," Kong Tingyun answered as they traveled.
Kong Tingyun chuckled lightly and continued, "He is totally shaking in his boots! The Pristine Water Fruition Attainment is no ordinary one... Many are keeping their eyes on him."
