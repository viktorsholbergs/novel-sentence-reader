Xiao Xian left the courtyard quietly. The cold wind sobered him up instantly. He walked a few steps up the stone stairs, gusts of wind blowing all around him. In an attempt to curry favor, a servant stepped forward, saying, "You are truly devoted to Lady Qingxiao, Young Master Xiao. You even allow Li Yuanping to boss you around, all for her sake... Everyone can see it. Lady Qingxiao must be deeply moved!"
Xiao Xian nodded with indifference, inhaling the scent of incense wafting through the air in Lijing Town. He was a kind-hearted person, so he did not mind the servant speaking casually and using phrases like "boss around."
The servant, seeing him silent, could only follow quietly. He had indeed hit the nail on the head. Preoccupied with his own thoughts, Xiao Xian rubbed the jade ring on his finger absentmindedly.
Although he was indeed fond of Li Qingxiao, he did not feel that he was as devoted as everyone said he was. His actions were not solely driven by self-interest but were also in the best interest of the entire Mount Yu branch.
"Ancestor Chuchou was always kind toward our branch, but he died of old age last year. Our family lost its support, and my father has become increasingly worried... These years have become more and more difficult..."
Xiao Jiuqing was a charming man with many offspring, many of whom possessed spiritual orifices. Xiao Xian's talent was not particularly good, so he never mattered much to Xiao Jiuqing.
Accompanying Xiao Guiluan to the Li Family that year had changed Xiao Xian's fate. He returned home with two pieces of pastry, wet and sticky, and told his mother everything. Her sharp instincts, honed from years of fighting and scheming in the mansion, quickly identified key points to leverage.
She called Xiao Jiuqing and exaggerated the story to him, delighting him in the process. Caught between fear and uncertainty, Xiao Xian suddenly found himself unable to avoid the Li Family. Rumors began to spread about a fated connection between the two, and Xiao Xian felt compelled to visit the Li Family.
"What kind of fate is this..."
For the past few years, Xiao Xian had been diligent, unable to tell if it was due to family pressure or his feelings for Li Qingxiao. He smiled wryly. Without Xiao Jiuqing's many resources and connections, Xiao Xian, with his limited cultivation, would never have been able to obtain such secretive information to share with Li Yuanping.
As the evening breeze brushed past his face, Xiao Xian sobered up even more. He had not actually drunk much spirit wine, but being around Li Yuanping always made him uneasy, causing him to find an excuse to leave the courtyard after a few cups.
In the darkness, Mount Lijing lay silently. Xiao Xian turned to look at the mountain, which was coiled like a serpent dragon. A faint sense of fear rose in his heart.
The Li Family has the appearance of wolf leaders. They are probably crouching and hiding now, but they would never be content living under our Xiao Family or even the Azure Pond Sect... Our family's alliance with the Li Family might bring disaster in the end...
The servant, bending over to serve, noticed Xiao Xian's gaze fixed on Mount Lijing and said softly, "Young Master, this mountain's earth veins are shallow, and its spiritual energy is thin. It cannot be considered a famous mountain."
"Famous mountain?" Xiao Xian chuckled, shook his head, and regained his composure. He slowly walked away, uttering another simple statement to his servant.
"You never know."
Mount Lijing was illuminated from top to bottom with golden candlelight flickering throughout the mountain, making the darkness of the mountain less frightening.
High above in the clouds, Li Tongya stood in mid-air, holding a tightly wrapped long sword on his back. He stared expressionlessly at the person in front of him.
This person had a kind face but was plump with large ears. He wore a brownish-yellow robe and held a golden glowing monk staff in his hand. The golden rings on the staff clanged together, emitting a faint tinkling sound. He stared calmly at Li Tongya, a halo of colorful light swirling behind his head.
"Murong Xia has already left our territory. Even if you use your spiritual sense to search, you will not find him. Master Monk, you have been confronting me for a long time; you should be satisfied now!" Li Tongya spoke slowly, his tone still calm, although his heart was boiling with anger.
He had instructed Li Yuanjiao to let Murong Xia go out of sheer necessity. This Buddhist monk had been holding him back, and without using the mirror, he could not deal with them and was even at a disadvantage.
"Your generosity is greatly appreciated, Benefactor. Minghui is deeply grateful!" the Buddhist monk said as he nodded slightly, the golden light suppressing Li Tongya gradually fading. Li Tongya also retracted his mana, feeling a slight sense of relief.
Li Tongya had been cultivating on the mountain when Li Qinghong shattered the jade talisman for help, startling him. Although Murong Xia only displayed the power of roughly the sixth to seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Li Tongya genuinely felt threatened and was prepared to act. However, this unknown Buddhist monk had intercepted him.
Without another word, the monk raised his staff and emitted golden light, forcibly suppressing Li Tongya. After exchanging dozens of blows, Li Tongya felt his internal organs burning like fire and realized that he was not the monk's match. He had no choice but to hold the monk off until Murong Xia left the territory, at which point the tension eased.
"To think a Buddhist monk would protect a devil cultivator who eats humans... Master Monk, you have quite the heart!" Li Tongya mocked blandly.
Minghui, the monk, smiled softly and replied, "You are mistaken, Benefactor… Murong Xia merely removed these people's physical forms to bring them salvation. It is a great fortune for these two-legged sheep to enter the Euphoria Realm, a grand blessing that can only be achieved over nine lifetimes!"
Li Tongya sneered without responding. Minghui formed a hand seal and explained, "I am the top disciple of the Lotus Temple, ordered to escort Murong Xia south. If there has been any offense, please forgive me. There will be blessings in return.
"Murong Xia follows the Virtuous Benevolence Devil Dao, which is also part of my Virtuous Benevolence Zen Dao. He was ordered to go south and consume 106,756 people. Afterward, he will meditate in Linghai Prefecture to achieve enlightenment, become a Maha, and reform into the Virtuous Benevolence Zen Dao, bringing these 106,756 people into the land of blessings. It is a meritorious deed."
Li Tongya has heard of the eloquence of Buddhist monks and now experienced it firsthand. He avoided engaging further and replied directly, "The south is the domain of my immortal sect. Have your Buddhist sect obtained permission?"
Minghui nodded slightly and answered, "The immortal sect reclaimed Xu State and killed our Merciful Ones… This allowed Murong Xia to go south as an exchange. The Sword Immortal should be aware of this. If there has been any offense, I will personally go to the southern border to apologize."
Li Tongya, understanding why the monk was being so polite, realized it was due to Li Chejing's influence. While the immortal sect appeared mighty by reclaiming Xu State, it was merely an exchange of interests behind the scenes.
Despite his disdain for their methods, Li Tongya had to acquiesce.
"I see."
Minghui retracted his staff. Seeing that Li Tongya was a reasonable man, he smiled warmly. "I see that your clan governs benevolently, akin to our teachings. It must be fate! Why not let me stay here and spread our teachings…?"
Li Tongya immediately shook his head, wanting nothing to do with the Buddhist sect and hoping the monk would leave as soon as possible. He replied, "Your duty is to escort Murong Xia. Do not tarry."
His refusal was evident, but Minghui feigned ignorance and asked again with a smile, "Murong Xia has multiple monks escorting him; they do not need me. Your clan and our teachings are fated..."
"We are just a small clan, unworthy of hosting a great monk like you," Li Tongya had to refuse bluntly.
Minghui did not take offense, and instead replied, "Very well, then. However, I have one more question for you, Benefactor."
