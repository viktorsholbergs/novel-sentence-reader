The Miserable Barnacle’s End
* * *
Now, let’s go back in time a little.
Right after the 【Emi Cannon】 pierced through Barnacle Garozg’s shell and made the water giant disappear.
“Pyurururu!?”
Zaratopu hurriedly moved to the location where Emi fell to retrieve her, so it didn’t notice, but.
With a plop.
Something fell into the sea surface later.
<<<Ah, ah, agaaa…… it hurts, it hurts……!>>>
……It’s Garozg.
Despite having his shell smashed and most of his body blown away…… Garozg was still alive.
Using the remaining divine magical power, he desperately maintained his life, and although he was in tatters, his mind was still intact.
<<<It hurts, damn, aaah…… dammit……!>>>
And in his mind…… now that the obsession that had been dominating him was lost.
A new…… a new emotion was beginning to sprout.
Not something created by someone else’s obsession…… an emotion born from his own heart.
<<<How dare you, how dare you…… how dare youuu……!>>>
It was anger and hatred.
He was indignant.
About why he had to experience such pain, misery, and fear.
Originally, it was the fault of that jewel that happened to enter Garozg.
The obsession tainted on that jewel made Garozg desire domination.
Garozg was being manipulated.
He was a victim too.
It wasn’t his fault.
Yet.
Yet, why was he the only one suffering like this?
Unforgivable.
Unforgivable!
The absurdity of this world is unforgivable!
That isopod is unforgivable!!
The land creature…… is absolutely unforgivable!!!
Burning the flames of revenge in his heart, Garozg slowly, slowly sinks to the bottom of the sea.
He still has divine magical power left.
Eventually, he will be able to fully regenerate his body and remake his shell.
<<<When that time comes…… remember this……!!>>>
But, however.
To put it simply.
“That time” never came for him.
<<<Ugh……!?>>>
Garozg, sinking in the sea.
He suddenly felt a chill.
He resumed sensing his surroundings with magical power, which he hadn’t been doing to concentrate magical power on regenerating his body.
And he noticed.
<<<Wha!?>>>
He is currently surrounded by countless sea creatures!
They were various shrimp, squid…… and mullet.
<<<What are you guys…… what’s with those eyes! Towards me…… disrespectful! You are being disrespectful!!>>>
Garozg puts on a false show of strength and tries to 【Intimidate】 his surroundings, but.
“…………”
The shrimp, squid, and mullet are silent.
Of course.
There’s no way shrimp, squid, or mullet can talk.
They are just marine creatures.
Wild creatures that act on instinct.
<<<Tch, annoying! Scatter…… scatter!!>>>
Even when Garozg released 【Intimidation】 and swung his barely remaining cirri around.
They didn’t move away from Garozg.
On the contrary.
<<<Ouch!?>>>
……One of the mullets finally took the lead and bit Garozg.
Shaking its body, which was small from Garozg’s perspective, it tore off his weakened flesh!
And as if that was a signal.
Shrimp, squid, mullet!
They all started swarming Garozg’s body at once!
<<<Aaaaah!? It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!!!>>>
They don’t even pay attention to Garozg’s 【Telepathy】 screaming and crying!
They single-mindedly tear at Garozg’s body!
Many of them suffer from magical power poisoning and die from eating Garozg’s body that contains a large amount of magical power.
However, even seeing their companions die in such a way, they never stopped.
Gnawed, gnawed, gnawed!
Garozg’s body keeps getting smaller and smaller……!
<<<S-Stop, stooop!! G-Get away!!>>>
Garozg shouted!
<<<Even though you’re just small fry without intelligence!!>>>
He shouted!
<<<You are being disrespectful to me!!>>>
He shouted desperately!
<<<Even though I’m the king!! Even though I’m the chosen barnacle……!?>>>
Finally.
He spouted such nonsense at the end.
And immediately realized it was nonsense himself.
And without having time to think about anything else.
He died.
Losing his armor and being swarmed by enemies, he dies.
That.
From the perspective of a king, it could be said to be a spectacular end.
However, from the perspective of a marine creature, it could be said to be a relatively common end.
