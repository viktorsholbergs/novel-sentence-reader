As Li Xizhi pondered, someone arrived from below. This person wore simple clothes and had some snowflakes on his shoulders, and he appeared to be in a hurry.
He hastily brushed the snow off his body, first bowed to Xiao Guiluan at the top, then called out loudly, "Brother Zhi!"
Li Xizhi quickly stood up and walked over to greet him, asking, "Brother Cheng, what brings you here?"
Li Xicheng, covered in dust and wearing thin clothes without any accessories, cheerfully took out a jade pendant from his chest pocket and smiled. "I heard you are about to join the sect, so I found something good for you!"
He had not received the talisman seed and was oblivious to many family secrets. He only saw joining the Azure Pond Sect as an immensely beneficial thing and proudly presented the jade pendant, which glowed with a green light. He placed it in Li Xizhi's hand while explaining with a smile, "This is an Embryonic Breathing Realm dharma artifact, capable of condensing spiritual qi. Consider it a gift from your elder brother!"
Li Xizhi was momentarily stunned. His father was Li Yuanjiao, and his grandfather was Li Xuanxuan, the leaders of the Li Family for generations. He lacked for nothing of such trinkets, but seeing Li Xicheng's joyous expression filled him with mixed feelings.
Li Xicheng's father had no spiritual orifice, and his grandfather had died early, making their lives much harder. This jade pendant was a precious item to his elder brother, who forced it into Li Xizhi's hand.
Looking at his brother's simple attire without any mana light, yet still looking at him warmly, Li Xizhi held the jade pendant tightly as strong emotions surged in his heart. Feeling as if it were a burning coal and not knowing what to say, he stammered, "Brother Cheng... you shouldn't have!"
Li Xicheng, who had spent the past few months overseeing Spirit Paddies in the mountains, had gained some experience and spoke more confidently. He laughed and said, "Your elder brother now holds a position in the clan and receives stipends. Do not refuse my gift!"
His tone was warm, but Li Xizhi felt even more conflicted. He grabbed his brother's hand, having long wanted to speak with him, and said softly, "I heard that your expenses are tight, and your pockets are empty. The family's resources and your stipends are half given away and half lent to the clan brothers… Is that true?"
"Well..." Li Xicheng hesitated, stammering, "I'm just helping out the brothers... The clan has been going through tough times lately, and everyone is struggling."
"Oh," Li Xizhi had no idea what to say. He embraced his elder brother firmly in his broad chest as he jokingly reminded him, "You should be more frugal. Be careful, or the clan chief might accuse you of being a spendthrift and a big spender!"
Li Xicheng chuckled softly, but Li Xizhi wasn't sure if he heeded the advice. A servant stepped forward and respectfully informed, "Young master, the carriage has arrived."
Upon hearing this, Li Xizhi nodded slightly. He looked at Li Xicheng's beaming smile, and all his previous frustration vanished, now replaced by determination and anticipation.
Lijing Town.
Li Yuanjiao, clad in black, stood silently in the snow, his sword by his side. Snowflakes fell on him, only to slide off shortly after. Li Xizhi stood beside him, gazing absentmindedly at the horizon.
The Li Family members waited for a moment. Amidst the swirling snow, a Daoist in green robes arrived riding a deer. The woman appeared to be in her thirties, radiating an extraordinary aura.
The deer beneath her had pure white fur and was adorned with spots of green, and moved with grace and agility. Its eyes were lively. The woman on the deer wore fluttering robes, giving her a celestial appearance. Around her waist, a long ribbon was tied, fluttering constantly in the wind.
The ribbon had intricate patterns, light and transparent, clearly a fine dharma artifact.
"Members of the Li Family greet the Peak Master!"
The Li Family members greeted her respectfully as Yuan Tuan smiled and nodded. As soon as the white deer touched the ground and kicked its four hooves, it turned into a patch of white snow and disappeared.
This miraculous display left the Li Family and their guests in silent awe. Yuan Tuan responded, "No need for formalities."
Yuan Tuan, who was around the same age as Li Tongya, had reached the Qi Cultivation Realm at eighteen, even faster than his senior brother, Xiao Yuansi. However, for reasons unknown, after achieving the Qi Cultivation Realm, she focused on talismans and spirit plants, causing the progress of her cultivation to suffer.
At that time, their master, Si Yuanbai, was imprisoned, and her senior and junior brothers were all in the southern border. Yuan Tuan had to support Qingsui Peak alone, enduring much hardship. Fortunately, in the past decade, she made several breakthroughs and achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm. Life improved significantly for her since then.
"Please come inside, Immortal Master..." Li Yuanjiao said politely.
Yuan Tuan nodded gently and walked gracefully across the snow. The guest cultivators and other family members withdrew, leaving only a few direct descendants to accompany Yuan Tuan inside.
Her gaze lingered on the sword at Li Yuanjiao's waist for a moment, then she turned her head slightly, feeling somewhat uncomfortable.
"Is that the Qingche Sword..?" she asked softly.
"Indeed!"
Li Yuanjiao had replaced the sword at his waist, the Dragon Coiling Pillar, with the Qingche Sword. He removed its covering, proudly displaying it instead of hiding it like he usually did.
"This sword..."
Yuan Tuan's expression turned complex, and she said in a low voice, "I accompanied my master to acquire this sword for him. At the time, our peak was struggling, and we could only afford a peak Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact. Yet, Jing'er was overjoyed and thanked us profusely… Who would have thought that this sword, after slaying demons and absorbing sword intent, silently advanced and became a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact."
The Li Family members listened silently. Yuan Tuan raised her eyebrows, glanced at Li Yuanjiao, and asked, "Since you wearing this sword at your waist… you must be the head of the Li Family?"
Li Yuanjiao had rehearsed his response many times. He answered respectfully, "Lord Chejing had no descendants. I, a junior of the Yuan generation named Jiao, am considered his successor and thus wear this sword."
"No descendants, huh..."
Yuan Tuan barely maintained her expression, standing in place for two full breaths before following Li Yuanjiao's lead to the seat of honor. She silently scanned the faces of the crowd, and then asked warmly, "Why do I not see Daoist Tongya?"
Li Yuanjiao lowered his head slightly and said in a deep voice, "The ancestor is in seclusion and has yet to emerge."
"Oh…" Yuan Tuan nodded, then saw Li Yuanjiao signal with his eyes.
Li Xizhi stepped forward and said respectfully, "Junior Li Xizhi greets Senior!"
"Good!"
Yuan Tuan finally showed a hint of a smile. She scanned him with her spiritual sense, observing for a while, carefully examining his Qihai, Shenyang Mansion, and Juque Court acupoints, and then closed her eyes without saying a word.
This sight made everyone in the hall silently tense up. Li Xizhi forced himself to stay calm, feeling the Profound Pearl Talisman Seed in his Qihai acupoint, his heart pounding.
After more than ten breaths, Yuan Tuan finally opened her eyes and nodded.
"Not bad, you should join my Qingsui Peak!"
She then smiled brightly at Li Xizhi and said, "Good child, there is no need to be nervous."
With these words, everyone finally relaxed and felt relieved. Li Xizhi respectfully thanked her as Yuan Tuan looked at him with a smile and said softly, "Raise your head!"
Li Xizhi's face, similar to Li Yuanjiao's, showed a gentle and peaceful demeanor when he lowered his eyes. But when he raised his head, his ambitious look appeared, making Yuan Tuan smile lightly and say, "Your appearance does resemble your father… You have quite a fierce look and the potential to lead. It seems I have indeed picked up a treasure."
"Senior is too kind to my son..." Li Yuanjiao responded quietly and said, "Being able to join Qingsui Peak is a blessing for the Li Family."
"Yes…" Yuan Tuan nodded, then asked, "I heard your family has a young alchemist. Is he here?"
