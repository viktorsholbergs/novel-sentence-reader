Li Xicheng suddenly choked up, shaking his head helplessly. He took out the jade slip containing the sect system from his sleeve and handed it over to Li Xijun, then said softly, "The new system has just been established, and most of the positions are still vacant. However, Uncle Ping can still manage the family affairs for now. We should hold on to the current personnel… They will be reassigned eventually. You can see for yourself."
Li Xijun looked at his older brother in surprise, then took the jade slip and examined it closely.
"The Dual Clan System…" he murmured softly.
As he continued reading, he understood the peak and town counterbalance system described at the end. Going back to the front, he carefully read about the Dual Clan System again.
After a long silence, he remarked softly, "Clan Uncle... He's splitting the four lineages and planning to establish a government on a peak... Is this still a family?"
Li Xicheng, alarmed by what he perceived as a bold remark, asked in a deep voice, "What are you trying to say?"
Li Xijun's face turned gloomy as he replied, "With this approach, we'll become the Lijing Sect instead of the Li Family of Lijing! The harmony of a family is maintained through generational continuity… If the members are scattered among the various peaks, how can it still be considered a family?"
Li Xicheng cast a glance at him and asked quietly, "What do you propose?"
"Just a few modifications to be made," Li Xijun replied, looking again at the jade slip, feeling that something was amiss.
"This one only details the sect system, not the clan's system. External cultivators and those from the branch family can be distributed among the peaks, but not the major and minor sects," he added.
He swung his sleeves and rode the wind toward the central hall.
Meanwhile on Mount Lijing…
Li Yuanping had worked tirelessly for over a year, finally setting up numerous systems in place. As his workload gradually reduced and his efforts began to show results, he felt a sense of relief.
Big Brother has been cultivating in seclusion. I wonder how much longer before he'll emerge again and how confident he is to achieve a breakthrough…
Just then, a commotion erupted in front of the central hall. Li Xijun, who was dressed in white, hurried into the hall with a frown. He kneeled and bowed deeply, speaking in a solemn voice.
"Nephew greets the Family Head!"
He's here!
Li Yuanping had been waiting for him for a long time. With his current influence in the family, no one could contest the new law. Only the younger generation dared to voice objections, so he smiled and asked, "What do you think, Jun'er?"
Li Xijun's bright eyes met his clan uncle's gaze. He was not about to criticize the plan outright and embarrass Li Yuanping. Instead, he took a different approach to the matter.
"I have a request to make!"
"Go on," Li Yuanping encouraged him and listened attentively.
He enjoyed conversing with this nephew of his tremendously. Li Xijun always managed to voice his objections tactfully, without causing discomfort to anyone.
"My request is to rebuild the Snake Demon Cave Dwelling on the lake, fill in the lake to create an island, and establish a department there. We should move the direct lineage of the family, along with the most talented minor sect members, to this island to cultivate and use it as the headquarters of the Li Family."
He added softly, "Jun'er understands your vision. What I mean to say is… the Dual Clan System should not turn our family into a sect."
"Li Family on the lake and offices on the shore of the lake..." Li Yuanping smiled slightly and nodded.
Li Xijun then stepped forward, pointing to the map, and explained, "The lakeside will serve as a base for managing matters related to external cultivators and protecting the mortals. Meanwhile, the lake itself will house the cultivators from the four direct lineages of the family and the talented members of the minor sect...
"One day, when Moongaze Lake is unified, we can then move to the heart of the lake, where the marketplace ruins are. From then on, we'll become the exalted immortal clan of the lake, and the areas around the lake will become a prefecture..."
Li Xijun's ambition was evident in his firm gaze. Li Yuanping listened with growing excitement.
Li Xijun continued, "I have explored the cave. Although it is not suitable for growing paddies, it's quite spacious and rich in spiritual qi, making it ideal for cultivation! There's no formation protecting the cave, so our people have gradually withdrawn since the ancestor's death. Isn't it nice to be able to put it to use again?"
After making his point, Li Xijun lowered his gaze and added, "This is just my humble opinion..."
Li Yuanping shook his head with a smile and assured, "Humility is not needed here! My father has already sent word to Shanji Prefecture in the east and asked the cultivators of the Profound Peak Gate to move the mountain and build the island. He just wanted to keep it a secret to avoid any ambushes!"
Li Xijun was momentarily taken aback before he sighed in relief.
"So, clan uncle has had this plan all along… I was overthinking and speaking ignorantly!"
Li Yuanping laughed and asked, "Do you remember the Rui Family?"
He pulled out a vermilion brush, circled a spot on the map, and explained, "The earth vein of this mountain is weak, but the water vein is rich, and there is a spirit spring. I intend to ask the members of the Profound Peak Gate to move this mountain and place it on the lake to serve as our family's main peak!
"We can eliminate the influence of the Green Essence Copper and utilize this spirit spring directly, saving the family from having to purchase one. Not only that, isn't it wonderful to have another peak?"
The Li Family had acquired a Vein Searching Technique from the An Family years ago, known as the Earthly Court Detection Technique, which allowed them to thoroughly investigate the earth and water veins.
Li Xijun listened to the explanation and replied, "Can the earth and water veins still be used after the move? Will the spirit spring disappear? It's best we request the people from the Profound Peak Gate to assess whether these resources will remain viable after the relocation first."
Li Yuanping smiled and replied, "It's not really a big problem. Currently, twelve families on the eastern shore have pledged allegiance and are paying tribute to us. We can select the most suitable one and offer them some compensation for the relocation… It won't cost much."
Li Xijun sighed with relief, a smile spreading across his face. He stood up and said, "Uncle, you are wise! It seems like I was worried for nothing."
Li Yuanping's expression grew serious. He sighed and said softly, "Jun'er, there's something I would like to tell you… Your father passed away early, and the generation of Xi and Yue has more members in the minor than major sect. If anything were to happen to me, the family would rely on you. Xicheng is your elder brother, so I can't speak ill of him… Ximing has let us down too. As an elder, this is the best I can do for my family."
Having worked tirelessly for years, Li Yuanping's complexion had deteriorated, and his smile was no longer as warm and pleasant.
He continued in a subdued tone, "After this matter is settled, I will gradually step back from family affairs. You will need to take charge."
On Mount Yuting…
Li Ximing sat cross-legged. The true essence of the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Technique flowed around him, casting hues of gold and red in the dim room.
He slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a wisp of golden qi.
Perhaps due to lingering doubts about the divine abilities of the Man on Creek, the elders had imposed a surprisingly light punishment—just confinement. Everything else remained unchanged. He was still eligible to receive pills and resources from the family but he was no longer burdened by family affairs.
Although he was confined to this lonely little courtyard, any resources he required were promptly sent to him at all times. Li Xijun also visited him occasionally.
Li Ximing felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Feeling much at ease, his cultivation progressed rapidly too.
"This is the best," he murmured to himself.
He practiced diligently every day and studied alchemy texts in his spare time. Considerate of his needs, Li Xijun frequently sent spirit items for him to practice with and aptly named his residence the Alchemy Pavilion.
Free from the clan's affairs, Li Ximing focused solely on refining pills and cultivating, channeling all his guilt into his work.
