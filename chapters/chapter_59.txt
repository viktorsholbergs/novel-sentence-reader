Li Chejing wandered around the cave, tracing the faintly glowing golden runes of the formation at the heart of the hall with his finger. He spoke with uncertainty. “My master only taught me some basic talisman techniques. Most of my training in the sect focuses on swordsmanship, so my understanding of formations is rather limited. This pattern doesn’t seem to align with the typical formations found in Yue State, it appears to be designed to mainly gather and nourish qi.”
“The spirit eye releasing this qi appears to be a natural formation, later enhanced with a formation to stabilize it. With the spirit eye’s influence, the spiritual qi in this cave is about forty to fifty percent richer than the outside,” he added.
After meticulously recording the formation diagram, Li Chejing scrutinized the cave’s interior. Finding no hidden passages or secret chambers, he finally approached the stone table and studied the white cloth laid upon it.
Greetings from Chi Wei. The target has reached Moongaze Lake. The cultivators sent by our sect have surrounded the area. Please act swiftly. The requested Flaming Sunrise Technique manual has been dispatched to you. The Spirit Jade and Fire Crystals will be delivered to your cave after resolving this matter. Be wary of the target; they are formidable. Should you encounter them unprepared, retreat toward the Azure Pond Sect and alert us immediately.
Li Chejing pondered over the message for a moment with a thoughtful expression. With a conflicted look on his face, he mused, “This person was probably among those who sought to kill the disciple from the immortal mansion. He seemed to be aware of the risks involved in this and cleared out his cave dwelling... The great battle occurred at the foot of Mount Dali. I did some digging after joining the sect, but the records I found were surprisingly vague and provided only a few details.”
Li Xiangping’s interest was piqued.
“What did you find in the Azure Pond Sect?” he asked eagerly.
Li Chejing’s frown deepened as he replied solemnly, “In the seventh month of autumn, Li Jiangqun, a rogue cultivator, who claimed possession of the Moonlight Origin Mansion’s true art, declared that the immortal mansion had been destroyed. Consequently, the three sects and seven gates were ordered to besiege and kill him at Moongaze Lake.”
While Li Tongya and the others were still processing the information, Lu Jiangxian, who had been observing them from Mount Lijing, felt a chill run down his spine. He was left dazed and disoriented as if struck by lightning.
The moonlight in his mirror fluctuated, threatening to dim as his mind was rendered a complete blank.
“Li Jiangqun…” The name echoed in his ears like a shrill whistle, overwhelming his six senses. A blinding white light then flooded his vision.
“That name sounds so familiar!”
Visions of shiny swords, spells, talismans, flying arrows, and the brilliance of dharma artifacts danced before his eyes, overwhelming him until he collapsed in anguish.
The mirror, floating in mid-air, quivered before gently descending onto the stone platform.
In the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche, Li Xiangping’s brow furrowed in confusion.
“If Li Jiangqun really acquired the true art of the immortal mansion, why did he claim that it had been destroyed? And considering that he’s supposed to be the rightful successor, why would they come after him at Moongaze Lake?”
Li Chejing shook his head and said, “The situation is more complex than it seems, possibly a conspiracy between the three sects and seven gates. I fear that delving deeper into this matter could endanger our family. Let’s not discuss this any further."
He abruptly changed the subject and asked, “By the way, does our family possess any legacies in the hundred arts of immortal cultivation?”
“None,” Li Tongya replied, shaking his head. “Such legacies are rare. The Wan Family offered to trade a set of formation legacies, but it requires the use of our family’s mirror.”
After a moment of contemplation, Li Chejing retrieved a jade slip from his storage pouch. “The talisman technique I inherited from the sect is known as the Six Stems Talisman Art. I’m bound by the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath, so I cannot reveal it. Fortunately, my master also provided me with the legacy of a rogue cultivator for reference while he was teaching me the talisman art, which I’m free to share with my family.”
Li Tongya and Li Xiangping happily accepted the jade slip.
“It’s called the Spiritual Talisman Method, and it includes the methods for making twelve talismans of the Embryonic Breathing Realm and three of the Qi Cultivation Realm. They’re not very advanced but are useful common talismans,” Li Chejing explained.
Smiling, he took out some talisman paper from his storage pouch and continued, “To draw talismans, you will need three items—talisman paper, talisman brush, and spirit ink.”
“Talisman papers are usually made from spirit plants. I recommend looking for seeds and planting your own spirit plants so that you don’t need to buy blank talisman papers from the market. The talisman brush is a type of dharma artifact. I don’t have a spare one with me, so you’ll have to get one from the market. As for the talisman ink…”
Li Chejing clapped the brocade pouch on his waist, then pulled out a small jade box. “I have some to start you off. Once you’ve run out of it, you’ll have to get more from the market. If the prices are too steep, a mix of cinnabar powder and spirit blood can also be used to draw talismans.”
Li Xiangping accepted the small jade box and smiled wryly. “This talisman craft does seem costly. I fear our family lacks the resources for it right now.”
Li Chejing waved dismissively, then pointed to a white jade bottle and said with a chuckle, “The Fire Baleful Qi is considered a rare commodity in Yue State. Since it’s not useful for our family right now, selling it should cover your costs and leave some profit.”
Li Xiangping nodded in agreement and added, “I heard there’s a market on Moongaze Lake which could be ideal for this.”
“Given the Fire Baleful Qi’s value, if you two were to handle this, you might attract unwanted attention. Since tomorrow is a full moon, I’ll handle this personally as a disciple of the Azure Pond Sect.”
After a thorough discussion, the group finalized their plan. Aware that time was of the essence for Li Chejing, they promptly departed for Moongaze Lake.
With the Divine Movement Spell, Li Tongya and Li Xiangping conjured a breeze with each step. Li Chejing, however, was even more graceful, seemingly stepping on the wind itself, his speed surpassing that of his older brothers.
Watching him, Li Tongya and Li Xiangping could not help but feel a touch of envy.
As they progressed, the shimmering expanse of Moongaze Lake came into view. For Li Xiangping, it had been over a decade since his last visit.
“I remember coming here with Second Brother to collect the jade from the lake. We were barely fifteen or sixteen then. Now, we’ve started our own families and even have children of our own,” Li Xiangping reminisced.
Gazing at the stars above, a wave of nostalgia washed over him. The past ten years seemed like a dream, the memories floating like clouds in his mind.
It was as though he was back on that moonlit night, waiting in the reeds by the lake for Li Tongya’s return.
“How time flies,” Li Tongya agreed softly.
They scoured the lake’s edge. With their spiritual sense, Li Chejing and Li Tongya finally detected a spot on the shore where mana subtly fluctuated, matching the description in the Lixia Secret Note.
Following the instructions in the Lixia Secret Note left by Si Yuanbai, they picked up a pebble, cast the Golden Light Spell on it, and then hurled it toward the lake’s center.
The stone soared before plunging sharply, triggering the hidden spell formation in the air. A brief flash of silver light revealed the formation before it vanished.
“The formation’s activation should soon bring a boat to meet us,” Li Tongya said.
The three brothers waited in silence on the shore. As time ticked on, their anxiety grew.
“If we miss this chance, dealing with the Fire Baleful Qi will be a whole lot trickier.”
