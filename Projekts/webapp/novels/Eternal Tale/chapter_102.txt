"Old Ox, how about we find another snow peak and build a little cabin in the clouds?" Chen Xun smiled faintly, his eyes drifting as he gazed at the ever-shifting pure white sea of clouds nearby.
Just a moment ago, everything was calm, but now the winds and clouds were stirring, with billowing waves rolling in.
"Moo~~" The big black ox exclaimed with delight, thoroughly enjoying this magnificent scenery that surpassed their wildest imaginations. Truly, the path of cultivation was wonderful.
If they were still ordinary people, they would never dare to climb such a snowy mountain. And during their time in the Five Elements Sect, or South Dipper Mountain, there was always a safe flying distance. They had never experienced such freedom before.
But they had to thank the vastness of this world and the richness of the Qian Nation. Otherwise, they might have faced restrictions wherever they went.
Chen Xun lay down, hands behind his head, eyes lost in thought as he gazed at the clouds, his heart completely at peace.
Perplexed, the big black ox moaned a couple of times and then, imitating Chen Xun, lay down as well, flipping onto its back to gaze at the sea of clouds. It didn't have as many thoughts as Chen Xun.
The sunlight was exceptionally dazzling, shining on them as if they were made of gold.
"An omen... I've seen one before, but it shouldn't have been in the clouds," Chen Xun murmured, lost in thought. "What if we were to condense our cores here, above the clouds? Who knows..."
"Moo?"
"It's nothing, Old Ox; just look at you."
"Moo~"
The big black ox grinned, then turned its head to gaze at the sea of clouds again, simply enjoying the moment along with Chen Xun.
"However, with so many snow peaks around here, we must observe carefully to prevent any dirty tricks from ruining our grand plans," Chen Xun said, his gaze turning slightly cold. They had no background to rely on, only caution could ensure their safety.
He turned his head with a slight smile. "Old Ox, I'll teach you how to ski. I'll go make the skis, and we'll slide down from here."
"Moo?!" The big black ox hesitated for a moment, not understanding what it meant to slide down from here.
With a mysterious smile, Chen Xun summoned the immortal sword in an instant and flew off with the big black ox to gather materials.
The next day, under the same brilliant sunlight, on the Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun...
If one stopped to watch from afar, it would seem like two black shadows dragging long trails were plunging down from the summit, seemingly shouting something in their mouths.
If one stopped to watch from nearby, the two black shadows seemed to be tumbling down continuously, their words becoming clearer and clearer.
"Oh, damn it, Old Ox! Damn it!!"
"Moo!! Moo!!"
...
The two heart-wrenching screams echoed into the sky as they had made a mistake and tumbled down from the summit of the snow peak...
The towering snow ridges were covered in snow that had accumulated for, who knows, how long. The Snow Mountain of the Morning Sun had always been lonely, but today it finally had a bit of life and vitality.
Two days later, the weather cleared up.
Chen Xun and the big black ox had mastered the skill. They plunged down, feeling the cold wind whistling past their ears, as if they had forgotten everything else, just enjoying the moment.
"Wow! Old Ox, let's go!!"
"Moo moo!!"
"Hahaha."
...
The snow peaks were now covered in countless chaotic scratches, as if they had been painted from a distance.
Sometimes, Chen Xun would sigh deeply, as if, while gaining immortality, he had also lost some worries...
But accidents were bound to happen, and one shouldn't get too complacent.
An avalanche!
The massive avalanche shook the earth, and with a thunderous roar, a gigantic snow wave, like a tsunami, rushed towards them.
The frenzy of the avalanche continued to spread, erupting with thunderous sounds, relentlessly chasing after the duo of man and ox.
The snow wave instantly engulfed them, giving them no time to react.
In the midst of the anomaly, within the snow wave, a red light shone, and countless white snowflakes exploded, as if even the avalanche had paused for a moment. Two figures, riding their swords, shot out instantly.
With a mocking expression in their eyes, they shouted:
"Is this all you've got? Huh? Is this it?!"
"Moo moo moo?!"
"Old Ox, let's go!"
"Moo~!"
...
Snowflakes fluttered in the sky as the two figures departed gracefully, leaving only that mocking grin in the sky, before disappearing elsewhere.
But this incident also confirmed to Chen Xun one important fact: indeed, it was an uninhabited area, not even a mountain bandit in sight, not a single bird seen.
...
In the days that followed, Chen Xun finally fulfilled his promise, finding a good piece of land for the big black ox, with a small stream left behind by the glaciers nearby.
This is fertile land, lush and green, with a snow peak in the distance and fresh air.
The big black ox was almost moved to tears with excitement. Indeed, Chen Xun never lied to it. All the land here belonged to it!
They lived halfway up the mountain, building a small house. Chen Xun made a rocking chair and sat with books in hand, occasionally glancing at the big black ox plowing the fields.
One place, one person, and one ox were all they needed through the seasons.
Life finally slowed down, and Chen Xun felt profoundly at peace. He often sat in front of the house, emptying his mind, just sitting there.
In the morning, a gentle breeze carried a fresh, fragrant, and elegant scent of soil.
The big black ox ran off to play in the distance, while Chen Xun sat in front of the house, watching the sunrise in the east, his gaze gradually becoming deep.
He often looked into the distance, recalling the past, which was always filled with both beauty and sorrow.
"According to the passage of time, you should have left by now..." Chen Xun looked into the distance with a faint smile on his lips. "May all fellow cultivators be well and safe on the path to ascension..."
The long road ahead is all about the scenery; do not look back in thought.
He slowly stood up, hands behind his back, gazing into the distance. The vast mountains and rivers filled his heart with openness and melancholy.
"Old Ox, let's go!" Chen Xun picked up a hoe, put on a straw hat, and went to plant flowers. They had to add a sense of ceremony to their daily lives.
"Moo~~" The big black ox also wore a large straw hat, happily calling out as it ran around, circling a big circle before coming back to Chen Xun's side.
Days passed like this, and the lush land gradually became more colorful.
There were large tracts of fertile land and colorful flower seas. Whenever the snow wind blew, the flower sea undulated, swaying with the wind, dreamy and mysterious.
At night, Chen Xun and the big black ox would light a bonfire in front of the cabin and gaze at the stars.
Chen Xun would also tell stories to the big black ox, who surprisingly took notes with a small booklet, his eyes filled with seriousness.
By now, the big black ox had finally understood that their lives were the goal that countless people strived for and the regret of many others.
Carefree and fanciful...
Every day, they would climb mountains and cross waters, gradually learning more about their surroundings.
In Chen Xun's words, since there would be celestial phenomena when condensing the core, if there wasn't a hundred percent certainty, what was the difference between that and seeking death?
...
Years scattered like foam in the blink of an eye, unable to resist the desolation of the city, and ten years had passed since the snow avalanche.
Chen Xun and the big black ox finally confirmed the safety of their surroundings. Their state of mind seemed to have undergone a different kind of sublimationâ€”calm, quiet, and indifferent to the world.
On top of a certain snowy peak, Chen Xun and the big black ox had changed into fierce bandit costumes. They looked down upon the sea of clouds, which obscured all vision.
Five medicine boxes floated in the air, all containing elixirs with dan patterns and a unique fragrance.
"Old Ox, formation, prepare to condense the core and break free from the shackles." Chen Xun's eyes narrowed slightly, and the terrifying aura on his body continued to rise and spread.
Boom... Boom...
A low rumble echoed continuously in all directions. Chen Xun's black robe moved without wind, shaking the world. How strong is he now? Even he didn't know!
"Moo~!!"
The big black ox looked solemn, roaring loudly. Its hooves stomped downwards, causing the entire ground to tremble, and a vast amount of spiritual energy spread out suddenly.
The howling snow and wind around them seemed to be choked, beginning to stagnate.
Hundreds of formations were arranged in all directions. In this instant, the sea of clouds in front of him underwent a huge change!
Buzz... Buzz...
A mighty sound of breaking wind echoed at the summit of the snowy mountain. The remaining clouds rolled back, and streams of green light shot into the sky, exuding a chilling intent!
The entire ground trembled violently at the same time, with snow chunks and boulders rolling down the mountainside incessantly. Chen Xun and the big black ox stood still; their eyes filled only with endless coldness.
"Moo~!" The big black ox stood up, slowly supporting the large black coffin, exhaling a hot breath, looking at Chen Xun.
"Old Ox, it's up to you now."
A calm voice sounded, and the big black ox nodded heavily, finally showing a hint of fierceness in its eyes. It was time to get serious.
