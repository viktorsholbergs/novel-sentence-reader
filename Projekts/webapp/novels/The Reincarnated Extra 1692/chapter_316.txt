Pierce Through, 【Emi Cannon】!
* * *
<<<Wha…… Whaaaat!?>>>
Garozg unintentionally stopped his movement in surprise upon witnessing that incomprehensible action!
It ate it!?
It ate its companion!?
Why!?
Don’t tell me…… it’s trying to take in that land creature’s magical power by consuming it!?
However, that conjecture of Garozg’s was completely off the mark.
And the fact that he stopped moving here.
That was the turning point of his fate!
<<<Now, let’s go, barnacle monster!>>>
<<<!!>>>
Pulled by Zaratopu’s 【Telepathy】 and having his consciousness captivated by his thoughts for a few seconds, he hurriedly looked down.
What was there was the Great Sea Serpent with its cheeks greatly inflated.
What in the world is it trying to do!?
<<<Joint secret technique!! 【Emi Cannon】!!!>>>
The Great Sea Serpent glared at Garozg and…… shouted that in 【Telepathy】.
And the next moment!
From its mouth…… an ultra-high-speed water bullet was fired in a straight line towards Garozg!
<<<Oh, that’s what I saw you shooting at the shrimp earlier! Trying to surprise me……>>>
To defend against it, Garozg moved his arm that he had raised high to swing down into the trajectory of the water bullet and…… realized.
That water bullet…… wasn’t an ordinary water bullet!
The proof is that its color is black!
And!
“Raaaaaah!!!”
It’s somehow screaming!
That’s right, it’s Emi!
Inside that water bullet!
Emi, who had completely covered her body with 【Black Arms】 and turned into a pitch-black shell!
……Was contained inside!!
<<<Wha-What did you saaaay!?>>>
As Zaratopu had predicted, if it were just an ordinary water bullet, Garozg could take control of it the moment it touched the water giant’s body.
However, that didn’t apply to the pitch-black bullet filled with murderous intent moving according to inertia contained within the water bullet!
DOPPAAAAHN!!
A large circular hole was pierced in the arm of the water giant that was raised.
Because the bullet pierced through it, scattering spray, murderous intent, and black haze!
<<<Ooooh!?>>>
Garozg hurriedly raised his other arm, but the black bullet didn’t stop!
Zupan!!
Producing a smaller impact sound than before, that bullet easily penetrated the giant arm made by gathering seawater!
<<<Wait, wait, wait…… wait, wait, wait!?>>>
Looking closely, the shape of that bullet had changed from the beginning.
It had changed its shape from a circle to a more aerodynamic cone shape like a spear!
And!
“Raaaaaah!!!”
While letting out a scream of some sort…… it was rotating at ultra-high speed!
What’s going on!?
……It’s simple.
Emi, inside that pitch-black bullet, started twisting her body and spinning around and around!
GYURURURURUUU!!
Rubbing against the air and making a tremendous sound, the mass of murderous intent continues to advance towards Garozg!
<<<Don’t get carried away, land creature!!!>>>
However, being frightened and running away.
Garozg didn’t make such a choice.
Because he was a king.
His pride as a king unconsciously suppressed his fear!
He became enraged, roared, and…… manipulated the water giant’s body to create multiple walls of water to block the bullet.
The water giant’s body could change its shape in any way.
……But!
ZUPAN!
ZUPAN!!
ZUPAPAPAPAN!!!
Breaking through every single one of the defensive walls Garozg created, the bullet continues straight ahead!
Its momentum doesn’t wane at all!
Rather, for some reason, its speed is gradually…… increasing here!?
<<<Whyyyyyy!?>>>
It was undoubtedly the jet black magical power released from the back of the bullet like a jet propulsion that played a role in its fantasy behavior, but……!
Emi was desperate!
Unconsciously manipulating magical power and drawing out the best!
Garozg was also desperate!
There was no time for analysis!
Extra-sama was desperate too, and Zaratopu, who was looking up at this offense and defense from the sea surface, couldn’t understand the details either!
Therefore, no one!
No one could provide an explanation for the phenomenon currently occurring here!
But in reality!
Such a thing doesn’t matter at all!!
Anyway, what’s important now, here is!
That pitch-black bullet has already!
Broken through all the multiple layers of water defense walls!
And finally reached!
The thick, rugged shell protecting Barnacle Garozg’s body!
……That fact!!
CHUIIIIIIIIN!!!
Emi, who had turned into a bullet, spun at ultra-high speed and bit into Garozg’s shell like a drill!
A high-pitched sound like metal being scraped echoed throughout the surroundings, and sparks scattered!
On the other hand, Garozg desperately strengthened his shell with magical power!!
Determined not to let his armor be breached, he desperately increased his defense power!
“Raaaaaah!!”
<<<Ooooooh!!!>>>
DOOH!!!
The magical power jet propulsion that Emi continued to release from the back of the bullet further increased its momentum!
Creak!!
An unpleasant sound comes from Garozg’s shell!
<<<D-D-Don’t mess with meeee!! I, I am the king!!!>>>
Garozg no longer held back!
He consumed the divine magical power at a tremendous rate and further strengthened the reinforcement of his shell!
The damage to the shell, its progress, stopped!
<<<Tsubobo…… Tsubobooboboo!!!>>>
There was still plenty of divine magical power left.
On the other hand, this land creature that had turned into a bullet.
For some reason, it was strangely strong, but in the end, it was just a slightly strong land creature.
Surely this momentum wouldn’t last long!
It was different from Garozg, who had taken in the power of a god!
If that was the case, it was inevitable that he would win this endurance contest!
Garozg, who had regained a little composure, laughed scornfully!
<<<Give up, land creature! Perish, land creature!!>>>
Garozg mockingly spoke to Emi.
<<<I am the king! Don’t interfere with the king’s path! I am the one who will build a new world of barnacles! The one who will dominate everything in this world!>>>
It was decreasing.
The divine magical power was decreasing.
However, there was still plenty of room left.
There was no problem.
Therefore, Garozg continued to speak with composure.
He tried to continue speaking.
<<<Because…… because I……!!>>>
But, however.
Ah, how pitiful.
<<<I…… I……!?>>>
Garozg’s speech stopped.
Why?
He didn’t know.
While he was desperately fighting.
There was one more thing he had been consuming along with the divine magical power.
It was obsession.
What exactly was the obsession he had taken in?
It was the thoughts that had tainted the jewel’s magical power.
There was still plenty of divine magical power left.
But what about the obsession?
In the end, it was just the obsession that human kings had accumulated over thousands of years.
Compared to the entire divine magical power, the part that was tainted by it was only a small portion.
The supernatant that would quickly run out if used in large quantities.
That was the true nature of the obsession that made Garozg a king.
The driving force that gave rise to the desire for domination.
That obsession.
Before he knew it, it was gone.
He had used it all up!
The moment that happened.
<<<I am…… the king?…… Why?>>>
Garozg.
This pitiful barnacle.
<<<Dominate everything…… why?>>>
Lost his identity.
<<<A new world of barnacles…… what’s that?>>>
……He lost it.
A large hole opened in Garozg’s heart.
And the momentary gap that occurs.
“Raaaaaah!!!”
Creak…… creak creak creak!!!
That gap was fatal in the face of the bullet of murderous intent.
Taking advantage of the weakening of the magical reinforcement, the bullet began to damage the shell.
Along with an unpleasant sound, cracks began to form in Garozg’s armor that he had spent decades enlarging.
<<<Ah, ah, aaaah!? Stop, stop, stooooop!?>>>
Creak creak creak!
Creak creak crack!
The pitiful barnacle’s screams didn’t reach Emi, who had turned into a pitch-black bullet and was spinning at high speed!
Finally, despite his pleas, the barnacle’s shell began to shatter!
<<<Ah>>>
And finally.
With a cracking sound.
A small hole opened in the shell.
And at the same time.
The white jewel that this barnacle had been carefully keeping inside its shell.
Spilled out.
<<<Aaaaah!>>>
I can’t lose that!
The compulsive obsession firmly created by the obsession, which had not yet disappeared, drove the barnacle’s body!
He threw away his defense and unconsciously stretched his cirri towards the white jewel dancing in the air.
<<<……Huh?>>>
But.
Why am I doing this?
Realizing the irrationality of his own actions after stretching out his cirri.
The movement of the cirri stopped.
The white jewel didn’t stop.
It fell towards the sea.
And the bullet…… didn’t stop either!
“Raaaaaah!!!”
Crack!
Crack crack crack crack crack!!
As if delivering the final blow, the momentum of the magical power jet propulsion increased even further!
Emi completely destroyed the barnacle’s shell!
Opening a large hole!
And finally!
It pierced…… the barnacle’s main body!!
<<<Gugyaaaaaah!!!>>>
The barnacle’s scream echoed throughout the surroundings!
Emi, still in the shape of a bullet, broke through the other side of the shell and flew towards the other side of the sea.
The water giant’s body, losing the supply of the enormous magical power that maintained it, collapsed with a roaring sound, splashing.
What was left behind…… was nothing.
After the water giant disappeared, there.
There were waves.
The sky was blue.
The clouds were white.
In other words, simply.
The usual sea scenery stretched out.
