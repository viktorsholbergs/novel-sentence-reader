“Lan Chang'an, how many years have you been with the Mu Family?”
Mu Renlong's presence was formidable, his voice resonant and authoritative.
“Twenty years,” Lan Chang'an answered.
“It's been that long?” Mu Renlong couldn't help but sigh, “Over the years, you've made significant contributions to the Mu Family, and you're considered one of our own now.”
“If you fancy any girl in the clan, no matter who she is, I'll make the decision for you!” Mu Renlong's encouraging gaze carried a hint of dominance.
Without waiting for Lan Chang'an's response, he got up and headed to the auction.
Lan Chang'an understood the implication of Mu Renlong's words: he supported Lan Chang'an marrying Mu Xiuyun. Even if Mu Maode disagreed, he would have to comply.
After all, the Foundation Establishment Realm Mu Renlong was the undisputed authority in the Mu Family, even more domineering than the previous ancestor.
Mu Maode's face showed a trace of discontent, feeling disappointed.
His exceptional daughter, with her stunning beauty and superior-grade talisman skills, had been taken by someone who seemed like a harmless pig.
But on second thought.
If it was a marriage into their family, Lan Chang'an, being an outstanding talisman master with a distinguished appearance and steady conduct, was quite suitable. This way, both talented individuals would remain with the Mu Family, firmly tied to them.
Previously, he was blinded by his fatherly emotions. In contrast, Mu Renlong, with his broader perspective, was more rational, directly supporting Lan Chang'an.
...
The Bamboo Leaf Mountain auction was held near the mountaintop in a newly constructed hall.
The auction was of high standard, requiring participants to verify possession of two hundred spirit stones or items of equivalent value. This instantly ruled out some of the poorer wandering cultivators who were just there for the excitement.
The Mu Family, as invited VIPs, naturally didn't need verification and used a special passage.
“Brother Renlong! Your presence brings great honor to Bamboo Leaf Mountain." An elderly Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Huang Family greeted Mu Renlong warmly.
“Foundation Establishment ancestor of the Huang Family, Huang Changling." Seeing the elderly man with prominent cheekbones, Lan Chang'an recognized him. After all, he had been in the market town for years and had seen or at least heard of the important figures of the Huang Family.
The Huang Family had three Foundation Establishment members; Huang Changling's cultivation wasn't the highest, but his seniority was high, and had been guarding the Bamboo Leaf Market Town all year round.
Hosting this significant auction, the Huang Family certainly brought more than one Foundation Establishment cultivator.
The auction hall was semi-circular and very spacious. The floor was covered with mats, each maintaining a distance of more than two zhang(1zhang=3.33meter).
The Mu Family’s VIP stand resembled a floating terrace, accommodating ten people.
Besides the high-ranking cultivators, the Mu Family also brought two young talents to broaden their horizons.
Lan Chang'an sat in the VIP stand, enjoying the spirit tea and spirit fruits served by a female attendant.
He looked down at the auction hall, observing the details.
Lan Chang'an noticed Li Ergou, Zhao Siyao, and Lin Yi sitting on adjacent mats.
Li Ergou grinned, also seeing Lan Chang'an on the VIP stand.
“Lan Chang'an has really clung to a powerful thigh!”
Seeing Lan Chang'an sitting with Mu Xiuyun and the Mu Family's high-ranking members, Lin Yi sighed inwardly.
Lan Chang'an might marry the Mu Family’s eldest daughter in the future, even if he was to marry into her family, it was enviable.
“Worthy of being a big brother.” Li Ergou admired Lan Chang'an. Recalling when they, the immortal seedlings, had narrowly escaped death and first saw that gentle and elegant girl, she was stunning.
Marrying the Mu Family’s daughter, they didn't even dare think about it.
...
Half an hour later, the mats in the auction hall were almost all occupied.
Buzz!
A gentle beam of light descended from the sky, illuminating the auction stage as if it were daytime.
"Welcome to all the Daoists who have come to Bamboo Leaf Mountain to support the event. I, Guangcheng Lin, am honored to have been recognized as the host to preside over this auction."
An elderly man in a slightly plump feather robe, smiling widely, cupped his hands towards the top and the right and left side of the stage.
“First, let me explain the auction rules: no spiritual sense threats, no malicious bidding, no private collusion... Any behavior disrupting the auction order will result in expulsion from the auction hall if the crimes are light or abolishment of their cultivation if the crimes are heavy.”
“Without further ado, the first auction item is the Clear Qi Pill.”
“As everyone knows, the Clear Qi Pill is a breakthrough elixir for advancing to the mid-stage of Qi-Refining. We have five pills today, each starting at one hundred low-grade spirit stones, with a minimum bid increment of five spirit stones.” As soon as he finished speaking, a beautiful attendant in a green dress brought in a tray.
“Clear Qi Pill!” “The first item is a breakthrough elixir.”
Cultivators from all directions were excited.
Although the Clear Qi Pill was only a breakthrough elixir for the mid-stage of Qi-Refining, which sect or cultivator didn't have juniors? Such breakthrough elixirs were always in short supply.
“I bid one hundred and five!”
“One hundred and twenty!”
Bids came one after another from all directions in the hall.
In the end, the first pill sold for nearly two hundred spirit stones, equivalent to the value of a mid-grade magical weapon.
Subsequently, the remaining four Clear Qi Pills were all fiercely contested and sold out.
“Next is the second auction item, the mid-grade magical weapon Green Steel Mother and Son Swords...”
The elderly man in the feather robe raised his hand with a smile.
“Mid-grade magical weapon! A complete set of magic weapons!” Qi-Refining mid-to-late stage cultivators’ eyes lit up.
Lan Chang'an was tempted. The Green Steel Mother and Son Swords were more powerful than the flying shuttle artifact he obtained from Master Ge Yi, comparable to the black net. But ultimately, he didn't participate.
Having an additional excellent mid-grade magical artifact wouldn't significantly enhance his strength.
In this auction, he had his eyes on certain items and wanted to conserve his spirit stones.
Next, one auction item after another was presented, sometimes causing a wave of excitement in the hall.
“The sixteenth item in this auction is a first-rank Life Extension Pill, of which there are three, each extending lifespan by five years. I remind everyone that for such Life Extension Pills, only the first one of the same grade will extend life; subsequent ones will not.”
“A first-rank Life Extension Pill?” Young cultivators showed little interest, but older cultivators' eyes gleamed. Several drowsy old men suddenly perked up.
“A first-rank Life Extension Pill, the holy medicine for prolonging life! Starting at two hundred low-grade spirit stones, with each bid increase no less than ten spirit stones.” The elderly man in the feather robe announced excitedly.
“Two hundred and fifty spirit stones!” An impatient white-haired old man in the ninth layer of Qi-Refining immediately bid, increasing by fifty spirit stones at once. However, this bid did not deter other competitors.
“Two hundred and sixty!”
“Two hundred and eighty!”
“Three hundred!”
In no time, the price of the Life Extension Pill soared fifty percent above the starting bid.
“Three hundred and ten!”
“Four hundred!”
A young, incongruous voice joined in, causing a momentary silence among the bidders.
An increase of nearly one hundred!
“Brother Lan?”
Hearing the familiar voice, Li Ergou was stunned, looking towards the VIP stand above.
The Mu Family's high-ranking members, including Mu Renlong, Mu Maode, and Mu Xiuyun, were all surprised, looking at Lan Chang'an.
“Lan Chang'an, did you practice some secret technique that drastically reduced your lifespan?” Mu Maode coldly stared at Lan Chang'an, then glanced sympathetically at his daughter.
“Maode, Lan Chang'an is in his prime and has plenty of vitality, definitely not going to die anytime soon.” Mu Renlong chuckled, also curious.
“This junior's late introduction to cultivation led to a lack of potential. Purchasing the Life Extension Pill is to make up for the lost years” Lan Chang'an was prepared, answering calmly.
“Eh... Is that the reason?” The Mu Family members looked at each other, unable to refute this reason.
However, normal cultivators, unless nearing the end of their lifespan, wouldn't pay such a high price for purchasing the Life Extension Pill. With those spirit stones, it was better to buy precious elixirs to improve cultivation as much as possible.
Moreover, whether a cultivator could advance to higher realms was often determined in their youth. Losing or gaining five years wouldn't change much.
Lan Chang'an bidding for the Life Extension Pill was because the Evergreen Technique required drawing on the Qi of the passing years and using healing secret spells would consume lifespan.
Life Extension Pills, with the word longevity, were closely related to the Evergreen Technique. He wanted to test what effect the Life Extension Pill would have on him.
“Four hundred and ten!”
A cold humph came from a certain aged late stage Qi-Refiner, adding ten spirit stones.
No Foundation Establishment cultivators participated because most had already used the first-rank Life Extension Pill, rendering repeated use ineffective.
“Four hundred and fifty!” Lan Chang'an's bid was aggressive, indicating he was determined to win.
This scene made the elderly cultivators glance at him, their fierce gazes locking onto him.
A young man with no worries about lifespan competing with them, who had one foot in the grave, for Life Extension Pills?
The group was instantly outraged!
However, Lan Chang'an was too young, just a rash youth, likely not the main bidder, so it wasn't necessary to get angry with him.
This person was sitting in the Mu Family’s VIP stand?
“Mu Maode! What's going on with your Mu Family? Sending a young man to compete with us centenarians for longevity?”
“Mu Renlong! Your father and I were close friends. How can you disregard your Foundation Establishment status and be so ruthless, trying to force us old folks to die early?”
These white-haired elderly cultivators gritted their teeth, directing their anger at the Mu Family's high-ranking members.
