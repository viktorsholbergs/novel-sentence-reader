Li Yuanjiao watched as the three juniors composed their minds and began meditating. He then glanced at Li Xicheng, who sat at the side with his six senses still sealed off. He gently took his hand, leading him out of the courtyard and into a secluded area.
Li Yuanjiao gently tapped on the space between the boy's eyebrows to undo the mana seal on his senses, and the boy immediately awakened. Meeting his slightly confused gaze, Li Yuanjiao asked softly, "Xi Cheng, are you training with the spear?"
Li Xicheng obediently nodded. Li Yuanjiao continued asking, "Did Aunt Qinghong ever teach you the Wing Clipper Spear Technique?"
"No. Auntie said she took the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath so she couldn't pass it on to others, so she didn't teach me," Li Xicheng replied eagerly.
"I see," Li Yuanjiao replied thoughtfully. He retrieved a jade slip from his sleeve and handed it to the boy, explaining, "Your younger brothers are inheriting the clan's legacies. This Grade Three Wing Clipper Spear Technique shall be yours to inherit. Take the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath and memorize it here in this courtyard before you leave, and you must never speak of what has happened today!"
"Yes!" Li Xicheng immediately responded. He hastily took the spiritual oath and accepted the jade slip from Li Yuanjiao as if it were a precious treasure.
"Thank you, Second Uncle!"
Li Yuanjiao nodded then slowly exited the courtyard, closing the door behind him. The protective formation separating the inside from the outside hummed to life, and his expression betrayed a trace of complex emotions.
"At least we've compensated for it… We have no choice but to hide it from him…" he murmured with a sigh.
Li Yuanping, who had been waiting outside, shook his head slightly and replied, "The fewer he knows, the better. Apart from the family head and those who have received a talisman seed, no one else is allowed entry. This rule has been set long ago."
"You're right," Li Yuanjiao replied with a smile before continuing, "Still, it's a surprise that three of them received a seed… That's beyond our expectations. It's about time for us to check on the boys."
Li Xizhi guided the profound pearl according to the Reception Method's instruction. It descended through the twelve stories—his trachea—then settled at the Qihai acupoint. Instantly, warmth spread throughout his body and his sea of qi churned vigorously.
"This!"
As a direct descendant of the Li Family, Li Xizhi practiced the best Embryonic Breathing Realm technique in the family—the Supreme Jade Meridian Nourishment Technique. It was a neutral Grade Three technique that harmonized well with most qi cultivation techniques.
Despite the technique's minor drawbacks and potential lifespan reduction, the accelerated cultivation speed made it a worthwhile endeavor. Having dedicated many years to its practice, Li Xizhi had successfully condensed three Supreme Jade Spirit Chakras within his body, each glowing faintly with the luster of jade.
However, as the white pill entered his body, the two of the Spirit Chakras condensed by the Supreme Jade Meridian Nourishment Technique within his Qihai acupoint began to tremble slowly and gradually turned shiny…and brilliantly white.
The previously grayish sea of qi churned, gradually clearing under the white light, transforming into a clear and serene pool.
"W-What... immortal technique is this?!"
Among the six chakras of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, Li Xizhi had already condensed the Profound Scenery, Radiant Lure, and Celestial Whirl chakras. Now, the two of them within his sea of qi had transformed.
He hurriedly circulated his mana and examined the Celestial Whirl chakra in his Juque Court near his lungs. Indeed, it had turned bright white too.
Just as Li Xizhi marveled at such a phenomenon, an imposing and deep voice resounded in his mind.
"Here stands the disciple of the Li Family—who has forsaken his worldly attachments… To him, I bestow the Profound Light, initiating their journey in the path of Dao, transforming them from mere mortals to saints. They will begin with discipline and ultimately ascend to truth! I grant them a scroll of the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, along with the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual!"
Li Xizhi's mind was flooded with strange words and profound phrases, deeply imprinting themselves into his mind. He concentrated intently, maintaining focus for the time needed to burn a stick of incense before slowly opening his eyes.
The blurred scenery before him gradually sharpened into focus. Li Xizhi realized he was standing in a dim, mist-shrouded environment that seemed as ethereal as a celestial realm. Soft white mana lights bathed his surroundings, casting a gentle glow overhead.
Directly in front of him stood a tall, ancient stone platform that was adorned with intricate patterns and a dazzling light floating just above it.
"That's…"
A bluish-gray mirror hovered in the air, with wisps of moonlight flowing out of it and creeping up along his robes. Li Xizhi could not even register Li Yuanjiao's words. His gaze was completely fixated on the mirror above him as he gasped softly, "What's that, Father?"
Standing nearby, Li Yuanjiao solemnly replied, "There was once an immortal cultivator who underestimated this immortal object and attempted to capture it with his dharma artifact… He was swiftly reduced to nothingness by the Supreme Yin Profound Light, along with his artifact. If you do not fear death, you may continue gazing upon it."
Li Xizhi recoiled in shock and quickly averted his gaze, mumbling quietly but frantically, "Please forgive me!"
However, his excitement soon returned in a flash as he wondered aloud, "Is it a treasure?!"
"Perhaps even more."
Li Yuanjiao gently guided his eldest son to kneel beside him while waiting for the two younger boys to complete their reception of the Profound Pearl Talisman Seeds.
He continued in a hushed tone, "This immortal mirror has a long history, handed down through generations in our family. Anyway, what technique did you receive?"
Li Xizhi immediately understood his father's question and replied, "The Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual and..."
Observing Li Xizhi's astonished expression, Li Yuanjiao chuckled.
"I see you've realized that regardless of your previous Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivation technique, once the talisman seed enters your body, the chakras you have previously condensed will be instantly transformed into the Supreme Yin Chakras, aligning with the practice of that immortal sutra!"
Overwhelmed by this revelation, Li Xizhi was rendered speechless. After a good while, he shyly admitted, "I had thought the green and white immortal sword was remarkable enough… I never imagined our family harbored such a marvel! Even the rumored Frosty Absolute Sword of the Azure Pond Sect can't possibly be compared to this..."
While they were talking, Li Xijun and Li Ximing had already opened their eyes and looked on with wonder.
Li Yuanping approached and spoke to them warmly before his face beamed with happiness as he announced, "Brother, both of them have received cultivation techniques too!"
"Excellent!" Li Yuanjiao smiled joyfully but quickly lowered his voice and said, "We shouldn't be noisy here, let's talk outside."
In the much brighter side hall, two boys were writing furiously. Li Xizhi, the oldest and more skilled with his brush, had already finished transcribing the Cold Pine Dew Snow Technique Manual.
"The immortal foundation that can be established by this Grade Three technique is known as Snow On Pine… This technique harnesses cold qi to control rain and snow, and the manual also includes a qi gathering technique. It seems quite impressive," Li Yuanjiao remarked, nodding as he finished reading the manual.
"The qi is to be gathered during the snowy season in the pine forest on a high mountain, under a cloudless moonlit sky. One can obtain a wisp of it in three months. Ten wisps make a portion," he added.
"That won't be a problem," Li Yuanping responded with a gentle nod, "Mount Yuting is high and snowy; it should be a suitable place to gather qi. I'll arrange for someone to plant the pine trees there as soon as possible."
"There's no need to hurry. The northern coastal peaks are abundant with pine forests. A trip there will be sufficient," Li Yuanjiao said, setting aside the wooden slip. "Moreover, establishing a pine forest will take time, even with the help of spells and techniques. Besides, we can't predict the challenges that may arise with this technique…" he added with a thoughtful gleam in his eyes.
Li Yuanping immediately understood the meaning behind Li Yuanjiao's words and nodded. As soon as they concluded their discussion, Li Xijun presented another wooden slip.
"The Golden Temple Radiant Origin Manual," he announced.
Li Yuanjiao picked up the transcribed manual from Li Xijun and read it carefully. After a moment, he raised an eyebrow in surprise and exclaimed, "A Grade Four technique?!"
He continued flipping through the pages eagerly, mumbling to himself in marvel.
"Excellent…excellent!"
