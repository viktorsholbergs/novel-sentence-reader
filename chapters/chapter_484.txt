Snow fell heavily. The sound of the words my dear rang sweetly in the air, catching Li Xuanfeng's attention as his gaze lingered on the soft, graceful figure before him. He responded politely, "Hemian, is the Daoist Master looking for me?"
Ning Hemian gave a brief nod then shook her head, saying, "Someone from the grotto heaven has arrived. The Daoist Master has already returned to Azure Pond Peak to pay his respects."
Ning Hemian had been married to him for five or six years now. Initially, Li Xuanfeng had reluctantly agreed to the marriage, but in the blink of an eye, those years had passed. They had always treated each other with mutual respect. Ning Hemian's mind was mostly on her cultivation, so their relationship was pretty harmonious.
Li Xuanfeng slung his bow over his shoulder and walked alongside her. Ning Hemian was always courteous toward him. After all, they had shared the same bed for several years. To say there were no feelings at all would be untrue, yet there was always something unresolved between them.
Li Xuanfeng harbored deep resentment toward the Azure Pond Sect. The deaths of many of his close relatives were tied to the sect. His wife and child had also perished in a deal between the Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate.
Originally, after seeing Chi Wei's death, Li Xuanfeng had thought that the Azure Pond Sect was in trouble, with an outsider Purple Mansion Realm cultivator proving too powerful for them to handle. He had secretly encouraged himself, sensing an opportunity, as Yuan Su seemed disdainful of the Chi Family and eager to act. His mind was filled with calculations.
However, a few months ago, Yuan Su had summoned him. He was informed that the Daoist Master would be leaving Yi Mountain City to pay respects to another Daoist Master named Suiguan, sent by the Azure Pond Grotto Heaven.
Another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from Azure Pond Grotto Heaven… What is this?
The news that the grotto heaven had sent someone to the sect—a late-stage Purple Mansion Realm cultivator, no less—left him feeling dejected. This meant that there were likely more of them in the grotto heaven. For ten consecutive days, he vented his frustrations on demons atop the city walls, pacing through the snow in silence.
His mind raced with countless thoughts as snow continued to fall from the sky. Beside him, Ning Hemian followed quietly. After a moment's pause, Li Xuanfeng decided to ask, "Hemian, do you know the origin of this grotto heaven?"
Ning Hemian nodded and, with polite formality, replied, "My family knows a bit about it. I can tell you about it but you mustn't spread it out, my dear."
Seeing Li Xuanfeng nod in agreement, Ning Hemian softly went on to explain, "My father once accompanied the Daoist Master inside. Outsiders call it Azure Pond Grotto Heaven, but that is not quite accurate… Its true name is Pristine Cadence Heaven. Very few people have entered, and there are hardly any people inside."
She hesitated slightly, as if pondering something, then continued, "The True Monarch who created the grotto heaven had strange intentions back then. There is no sky, no land, no sun, and no moon inside—only endless turquoise waters. To be honest... it is not truly the property of the Azure Pond Sect."
"Oh?" Li Xuanfeng was taken aback by this and asked, "Then whose treasure is it?"
Ning Hemian smiled reluctantly and lowered her voice, "Whose..? Perhaps some True Monarch's. In this world, Golden Core Realm cultivators are already immortal. Maybe he is hidden somewhere within the grotto heaven, or perhaps he has left to seclude himself in the heavens beyond. In any case, the Azure Pond Sect cannot fully control Pristine Cadence Heaven…"
Ning Hemian continued, "Moreover, it is impossible to stay long inside Pristine Cadence Heaven. It is not just mortals—even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators who stay for a few days will dissolve into blood. Purple Mansion Realm cultivators who stay for a year or two will lose their minds, their divine abilities will be exhausted, and they will turn into mortals."
Ning Hemian's expression grew more worried, her voice softening further as she continued, "Occasionally, a Purple Mansion Realm cultivator from the sect makes a trip there on order. My father once entered due to his unique cultivation method... but there was no one inside. Yet, someone suddenly stepped out of such a grotto heaven, wearing fresh clothes, claiming to be Daoist Master Suiguan, bearing the surname Chi."
Li Xuanfeng pondered this deeply, feeling a chill down his spine. Ning Hemian whispered, "My cousin also saw this Daoist Master Suiguan. He could not tell which lineage or family he belonged to, nor did he mention any ancestral ties. He said his surname was Chi, and Chi Zhiyun would not dare question him."
Li Xuanfeng stared at her, dumbfounded, "Are you saying…"
Her smile seemed hollow as she spoke, "Every move the Azure Pond Sect makes comes from orders within the grotto heaven. I used to think they could not come out, but now it seems they simply did not want to."
Ning Hemian's voice dropped as she added somberly, "Perhaps the grotto heaven is not the property of the Azure Pond Sect. Maybe… the Azure Pond Sect is the property of the grotto heaven."
Li Xuanfeng opened his mouth, but before he could respond, Ning Hemian pulled him into the house. She shut the door tightly, and the barrier formation activated automatically. As she helped him out of his robe, she whispered softly, "I am telling you all this in secret because, truthfully, I have my own selfish reasons…"
Ning Hemian paused briefly and continued, "My dear, I have come to sense certain things after sharing a bed with you for so long... The Azure Pond Sect is a colossal force that brings despair, clinging to the void itself... Please, let go of your hatred…"
Li Xuanfeng sat down on the couch as Ning Hemian nestled into his arms, undoing her clothes as her eyes brimmed with tears.
"I know you hate it... My Ning Family did not have it easy in earlier years either. If it were not for a Daoist Master's achievements, I don't know how miserable things would have been for us now."
"Does the Yang Family not hate the Azure Pond Sect? What about the Deng Family? Or the Yu Family? Azure Pond once had only sixteen peaks… Now, it has thirty-six. The younger generation of these families take great pride in identifying with Azure Pond."
Ning Hemian observed his expression, trying to guess his thoughts, and continued, "The Deng Family endured such hardship, yet only a few direct descendants hold resentment. Does Chi Zhiyun not know this? He simply does not care… Among the Deng Family, who does not identify themselves with Azure Pond? Who truly represents the Deng Family?"
Li Xuanfeng clenched his teeth as he held her, watching as her delicate face flushed with a shade of pink. Ning Hemian's eyes were filled with affection as she looked at him, speaking softly, "Do you think that Li Xizhi and Yang Xiao'er's children will hate Azure Pond for some long-past grievance involving Li Chejing from generations ago? I may not know how you managed to deceive your family's ancestor, but I doubt everyone in the Li Family possesses such abilities..."
Ning Hemian continued, "Today, the Yang and Yu families could be the target, and tomorrow the Li Family. Otherwise, it could be the Qi or Deng families. This scheme of Azure Pond can break down family bonds, turn enemies into allies, or assimilate them into the sect..."
Li Xuanfeng's palm was so hot that it left a red mark on her pale arm. Ning Hemian gazed at him lovingly, but the man's sharp eyes burned with intensity as he stared at her.
"Those within the sect are not necessarily friends, and those outside it are not necessarily enemies," he said.
Ning Hemian chuckled softly, resting her head against his chest as she whispered, "My Ning Family is a friend of your esteemed clan. As for who the enemy is… you and I both know that well."
Li Xuanfeng let her nestle in his arms for a long time, his passion already stirred. Finally, he lifted her with a growl, grumbling, "Stop talking about 'my Ning Family'... You are already married to me—now we are one. No more talk of two separate families!"
"Mm!" Ning Hemian responded gently. For the first time, the distance between their hearts vanished. She lifted her head and smiled affectionately.
