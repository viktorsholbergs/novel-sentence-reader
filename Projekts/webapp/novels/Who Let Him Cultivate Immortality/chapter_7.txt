Chapter 7: The Humble Elders
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
After everyone left, Lu Yang and Meng Jingzhou anxiously stared at their toes, fearing Yun Zhi would reproach them for their intent to cheat. It was only after a long pause that Yun Zhi finally spoke.
“I didn’t expect both of you to pass the tests and become disciples of our Dao Seeking Sect.”
“Both of you ranked high in all three tests, especially the third, where one of you was first and the other second. Overall, you have the best results. However, this doesn’t mean you were the best performers in this batch. Behind you are others like Barbarian Bone from the ancient barbarian lineage, Peach Blossom Leaf with the Feathery Immortal Body, and Li Haoran with the Fire Spirit Root, who are no less talented than you.”
Meng Jingzhou, brimming with confidence, nudged Lu Yang, “The Feathery Immortal Body is rarer than the Pure Yang Spirit Root, yet the senior sister said ‘behind us’, showing her high regard for us.”
Lu Yang helplessly explained, “I think she meant they were physically behind us in line for the first test.”
“Although you performed well, don’t be arrogant or complacent. In your future cultivation, you must be diligent and humble.”
Taking Yun Zhi’s increasingly serious tone to heart, both quickly assured her they would be earnest and diligent in their future practice.
Seeing their sincere tone, Yun Zhi’s expression softened slightly. “Since you gave me a ride, I’ll grant you an opportunity. you possess the Pure Yang Spirit Root, abundant in qi and blood, a natural nemesis to ghosts and spirits. The third elder among the eight elders is well-versed in this path; you may take him as your master.”
Meng Jingzhou joyfully thanked her: “Thank you, Senior Sister.”
“Lu Yang, you have the Sword Spirit Root, a natural seed of the Sword Path. The best in our sect at the Sword Path is my master, that is, the Sect Leader. You should take him as your master.”
“But Sister, you just said the sect master doesn’t usually teach disciples…” Lu Yang said softly. He noticed that what the senior sister said to Meng Jingzhou was “you may take him as your master,” but to him, it was “you should take him as your master,” implying different meanings.
“Don’t worry, I can decide on behalf of the master,” said Yun Zhi casually, as if the sect master had no choice but to agree.
“I’m merely suggesting. Like other disciples, you have a month to adapt. After that, you can decide whom to take as your master.”
Yun Zhi then flew towards Heaven’s Gate Peak, where the sect master resided.
…
Heaven’s Gate Peak, Council Hall.
A clear water mirror hung in the air, displaying the entire process of the three trials under the influence of magic, visible from any direction.
The eight shadows of the elders either nodded or shook their heads, praised or scolded, expressing different opinions on the disciples who passed the trials. At the most intense moments, they almost came to blows.
There had been precedents before. Among the eight shadows, several were of a temperamental nature, resorting to physical fights when words failed them. What was meant to be a process of evaluating juniors and selecting disciples ended up as a display of powerful magic battles, much to the amusement of the entire Dao Seeking Sect.
For this reason, the true bodies of the eight elders were not present, preventing any actual fights.
“Barbarian Bone is good, a pure descendant of the ancient barbarian tribe, unbeatable at his level with sheer strength and a simple mind, ideal for my inheritance”
“It’s a pity he’s too simple-minded. The ancient barbarians perished for this reason. He needs focused training.”
“What do you mean ‘suitable for your inheritance’? My lineage in weapon forging has lacked a suitable successor for a long time. Barbarian Bone is dedicated, which makes him ideal for my teachings!”
The two elders almost came to blows as they argued, but instead continued glaring at each other with rolled-up sleeves.
The other elders ignored these two and continued: “The Feathery Immortal Body, immune to all laws, pure and unparalleled, a rare sight indeed. It’s been ages since we last saw one, back when we first joined the Dao Seeking Sect.”
“It’s unfortunate that the last person with this body was too impatient in cultivation and perished before making a name for themselves in the Central Continent.”
“Sixth Elder, you’re the most familiar with such physiques. Perhaps this girl is fated to be your disciple.”
“Fire Spirit Root Li Haoran is a promising candidate for alchemy and weapon forging, but he’s too impetuous and restless. In the third challenge, he was eager to surpass Man Gu, exhausting his energy too soon. Eventually, he was overtaken by others, becoming the last to pass.”
“As for the young one from the Meng family and Lu Yang, with their Pure Yang and Sword Spirit Roots, they are exceptional talents. Their unique way of passing the tests is admirable. Such talents… Elder Brother, why don’t you take them under your wing?”
“You’re right. You only have Dai Bufan as a disciple, and he’s already independent. Taking two more geniuses would add another great story to your legacy.”
“Get lost! You’re just shirking responsibility. With their methods, taking them in means no peace for the rest of my life. I just want a quiet retirement as an elder. Don’t bring me trouble!”
“Second Elder, will you take them?”
“Do you believe I’ll take you first?”
The eight elders were extremely humble, showing no eagerness to take in these two Single Spirit Root talents.
“Damn it, whoever takes them won’t have a peaceful life.”
“Look, Yun Zhi is suggesting one to be the sect master’s disciple and the other to be the Third Elder’s. What do you think?”
The focus shifted to the Third Elder, who sighed in resignation. Yun Zhi’s suggestion was fitting, as he was best suited to train Pure Yang Spirit Roots.
Among the eight shadows, Third Elder stood out the most. Although not tall, he was muscular and robust, his vitality as bright as a torch in the dark. He was clearly a physical cultivator.
It was said that when he was young, his vitality was so overwhelming that he often went to the spirit fields, pushing aside the ox demons to plow the land himself.
“Hasn’t it been nine years since the sect master last secluded himself?”
“It seems so.”
Everyone realized they still had a sect master, whose presence or absence seemed to make little difference.
“So, how will the Sword Spirit Root become a disciple?”
As they discussed, a graceful figure approached on a cloud. The mist dissipated, revealing Senior Sister Yun Zhi.
“Yun Zhi pays her respects to all the elders.”
The elders quickly stood up to greet her. Now that the Sect Leader was in seclusion, Yun Zhi acted in his stead, managing the entire sect, her status above the eight elders.
“Yun Zhi knows that each elder has their preferred disciple, but choosing a master is a significant matter. It cannot be forced, so please do not interfere excessively when they choose their masters.”
The elders agreed, chuckling. “Of course, of course. But about the Sword Spirit Root becoming the sect master’s disciple, is that his wish or yours?”
Yun Zhi’s brow furrowed at the mention of the sect master, replying coldly, “Does it make a difference?”
The elders fell silent. Indeed, there was no difference.
What a joke, a decision made by you, would the sect master dare to disagree?
