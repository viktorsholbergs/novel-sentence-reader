The mid-sized Five Elements Teleportation Array was massive, several times larger than the arrays they had previously used. It was unclear how many layers of formations the big black ox had added to it.
A circular array was set at the center, surrounded by colossal Five Elements Stones, each half a zhang high. The teleportation array was further protected by the Five Extremes Formation, the big black ox's proud creation.
Improved for both offense and defense, as well as concealment, even divine senses couldn’t penetrate it. Any forceful probing would trigger the backlash of the God-killing Wind!
Standing in the center, the big black ox waved the array flag. Instantly, the entire island trembled with a deep rumble.
Cold sweat slid down Little Red's forehead unconsciously. The commotion was massive, far more dramatic than when they had used a transcontinental teleportation array back in The Great Li Realm.

Five-colored divine light illuminated the surroundings as the Five Elements Stones stirred up fierce winds. Sand and rocks swirled, and a spatial pulling force emerged.
Chen Xun remained calm, glancing at the big black ox controlling the array with absolute trust in his eyes.
After the time it takes to burn an incense stick, their bodies tensed as the power of the Five Elements encased them like chains. Little Red's expression turned grim—the suppressive force on their spiritual energy was intense.
With a flash of the Five Elements' divine light, they disappeared.
After their departure, the Five Extremes Formation began to operate automatically, concealing the teleportation array completely. The desolate island returned to its eerie stillness.
In the Forbidden Sea, on an island hollowed out like a shell, dazzling light erupted from a mining pit, shooting skyward with breathtaking brilliance.
Three faint figures gradually appeared within the array, their eyes filled with shock and a sense of disorientation, they had returned just like that.
The surroundings were familiar; the massive, abandoned mining pit was their handiwork.
"Impressive... Old Ox," Chen Xun marveled, looking around. "It really worked."
The big black ox snorted triumphantly and stood up, exuding an air of dominance. A dream of many years had come true.
However, there was still much to improve about the Five Elements Teleportation Array—such as the excessive commotion and the lengthy transmission time.
The big black ox began jotting down notes in a small booklet. Personally, using the array was vastly different from using it with test stones, sparking new inspiration.
"Brother Ox, with this vast cultivation world, can’t we now roam freely?" Little Red's eyes widened. "Who can possibly catch us?"
"Hahaha..." Chen Xun laughed heartily, exhilarated. "Soon, we’ll return to the Tian Duan Plains and set up another teleportation array there."
"Brother Xun, I remember the way. Let me lead!"
"No problem." Chen Xun slapped the big black ox energetically. "Old Ox, let’s go—off to the Western Sea to fish and await the Heavenly Gate’s opening."
"Moo~" The big black ox snorted absentmindedly, still scribbling notes intently.
Little Red glanced over, finding Brother Xun and Brother Ox’s habits peculiar. Why were they always writing in their booklets? Weren’t cultivators supposed to record techniques and methods instead?
Chen Xun lightly pushed off the ground, a breeze carrying him towards the shore, trailed by the writing of the big black ox and a chattering little lion.
By the coast, Chen Xun waved his hand, revealing the faint shadow of a massive ship, which soon solidified. The Five Elements Crane Spirit Tree onboard awakened, swaying mystically.
Chen Xun stepped onto the ship and sat atop the pavilion on the deck, gazing into the distance. "Brothers, set sail."
"Moo!"
"I’ll scout ahead!"
The big black ox and Little Red sprang into action as the giant ship roared with power, propelled by its formations toward the Western Sea.
In the Forbidden Sea, many young cultivators still ventured deep aboard large ships, filled with fervor as they battled obstacles, sea beasts, and the will of the Forbidden Sea itself.
"Watch out beneath the waves!"
"Purple Qi remnants ahead—avoid it!"
"Ancient warship—it's over, the aura of an ancient warship is here, run!!"
The Forbidden Sea echoed with the cries of The Great Li Realm cultivators, waves crashing like drums, stirring the heart. Danger lurked everywhere, striking fear and awe.
Some protectors soared to counter the threats, while others fled, abandoning their comrades. Still, others unleashed devastating divine weapons with furious roars.

A massive ship hidden deep within the mist sailed toward them, cutting through waves of cultivators' vessels and layers of purple mist.
Chen Xun sat calmly atop the pavilion, watching the younger cultivators' battles with an unperturbed expression.
"Over a hundred years in this Forbidden Sea already… time flies," he mused, a faint smile appearing. Now a seasoned great cultivator, he remarked, "Time is truly fascinating, and so is this cultivation world."
Nearby, the big black ox and Little Red chatted, their low laughter carrying softly. No one knew what they were discussing.
Several branches stretched quietly toward Chen Xun, keeping him company without a sound.
The faint sound of wind breaking passed low over the sea, causing subtle ripples in the dark waters. The horizon began to glow faintly as daylight broke, piercingly bright.
Suddenly, a vast expanse of blue appeared. The endless azure sky, dotted with fluffy white clouds like lone sails drifting over the sea, stretched endlessly.
A golden sun shone brilliantly, lighting up the world.
"Moo!"
"Brother Xun, we've emerged!"
The big black ox and Little Red exclaimed. The dazzling morning glow reflected off the vast sea like a celestial veil, turning the ocean into a radiant spectacle.
"Wow," Chen Xun stood up, the sea breeze rushing in.
His bandit-style garb gradually faded away, revealing a gentle, youthful face adorned with a warm, reassuring smile. Yet, his dark, profound eyes glimmered with clarity and calm, and the subtle curve of his lips hinted at unshakable confidence.
"Brother Xun, so many Yu family fleets!"
Before Little Red could celebrate, it grew alert. These banners marked factions it had memorized during its time in the Forbidden Sea. "Looks like they’re searching for someone."
"Moo~" The big black ox's eyes glinted sharply. These cultivators clearly had no intention of entering the Forbidden Sea, instead scanning passing ships constantly.
"Blocking us?" Chen Xun sneered. "The Yu family truly isn't afraid of us going on a rampage. Do they expect their junior disciples to hide forever?"
"Moo!" The big black ox pawed at the ground, ready to sink these ships silently with just a word from Chen Xun.
"Brother Xun, we’d better be cautious. If we act rashly, a Nascent Soul or even a Soul Transformation cultivator might mysteriously show up," Little Red warned, uneasy about these Golden Core cultivators. "Such factions aren't individuals we can deal with; killing a few won’t solve anything."
The big black ox glanced at Little Red, impressed. Despite being in the mid-Nascent Soul stage, its junior still retained its cautious nature.
"True, Little Red’s right. Others aren’t fools, and the power of a Soul Transformation cultivator is beyond us Nascent Souls," Chen Xun nodded solemnly. "The Yu family's boldness only shows they don’t fear us. Our grudge with them is now set in stone."
"Moo!" The big black ox's gaze turned icy. The Yu family's actions had surpassed mere personal disputes.
"Brother Xun, what should we do?"
Little Red, indignant for its two elder brothers, seethed. The arrogance of these human factions was infuriating, thinking they could act with impunity just because they stood atop The Great Li Realm's hierarchy!
"No rush. These are just ordinary cultivators; they likely don’t even know the truth," Chen Xun said calmly, a flash of lightning in his eyes. "Stick to the plan. Every debt has its payer—don’t lose focus and fall into their trap."
Little Red exhaled in relief. Truly a seasoned cultivator, Brother Xun always acted with prudence.
"Moo~" The big black ox snorted softly, waved the formation flag, and the giant ship ascended. Its concealment formation remained active, ensuring it couldn’t be detected by these Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivators.
Buzz!
The ship soared through the clouds, leaving the dim mist far behind. The air grew clear, free from oppressive remnants, bringing an unprecedented sense of liberation.
