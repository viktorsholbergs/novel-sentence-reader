"I see," Li Yuanjiao murmured.
Back then, Kong Tingyun did not use a single spell to deal with Wushao. Although Profound Peak Gate may not match Azure Pond, she should have one or two spells as a direct descendant. She must have been wary of me and did not use her full strength…
After Li Xizhi had finished explaining, he glanced at his younger brother and said, "This should be the Kui Light spell we got at home. It's perfect for Eighth Brother's cultivation path and will be even more effective when you reach the Foundation Establishment Realm!"
Although Li Xijun was defeated in just a few moves, he did not show any frustration. Instead, a spark of curiosity crossed his face.
"Brother Zhi! What are the limitations of your spell?"
"I was just about to share," Li Xizhi nodded with a small smile as he elaborated, "Heavenly Glow excels at both striking and snatching. Excluding direct lineage secret legacies, Floating Light Gathering ranks among the best in Azure Pond. However, the effectiveness of this spell relies on the opponent's sword cultivation and the quality of the sword they wield."
"If you could unleash sword essence or wield a Foundation Establishment Realm dharma artifact, it would have been challenging for me to snatch your sword," he explained.
He paused, glancing at Li Yuanjiao, and continued, "If it were the Qingche sword, not only would I fail to take it, but I might also end up with my fingers cut and bleeding profusely. Additionally, if the sword's intent is still sealed within, I'd likely lose my cultivation along with two pieces of my flesh."
Li Yuanjiao nodded, feeling significantly reassured by this information, and asked, "What if an Azure Pond Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator casts this spell?"
"Well, it's a sword that belonged to the Sword Immortal, so it should be quite difficult to take," Li Xizhi replied.
He thought for a moment, then added, "But the tactics of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator are unpredictable, and we don't know their spell's grade. It could likely still create a disturbance, affecting the opponent's swordsmanship."
"I see," Li Yuanjiao replied thoughtfully and then asked, "Has Yu Muxian practiced this spell?"
Li Xizhi understood the concern in his question but replied respectfully, "I have no idea..."
Li Yuanjiao resolved seriously, "Then I hope I can keep the sword intent within the blade, in case one of my descendants is talented enough to comprehend it and become a sword immortal. At the very least, it can be used against Yu Muxian instead of being wasted…"
Li Xizhi sighed internally, bowing to his father as he said, "I have also been keeping an eye on Yu Muxian… He's been quietly refining dharma artifacts in the sect this year. But he's a genius, and he has already... broken through to the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm!"
As expected...
Li Yuanjiao showed no surprise. He pressed his lips together, remaining silent.
His son continued, "Fei Qingyi, the female disciple of the Fei Family who trained at Yuanwu Peak, has broken through to the fourth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm and mastered the Ni Water Pure Rite technique. She is well-liked by Yu Muxian and loyal to him. If this continues, it could spell trouble for us."
"Hmph!" Li Xuanxuan frowned, his anger palpable.
"The Fei Family hasn't sent anyone to visit in years! They've likely forgotten how my second uncle saved their family with his sword and liberated Glacial Cloud Peak!"
Li Yuanjiao remained unfazed and replied softly, "This is how the world operates. The Fei Family is defending Fei Qingyi, and there's nothing we can say about it. We can only focus on our own matters."
Li Xizhi cupped his fist slightly, refraining from responding. He then hurried to change the subject, sharing details about the creation of the dharma artifact with Cheng Jinzhu. After a moment of thought, Li Yuanjiao took out a piece of blue-and-white ore from his storage pouch and asked, "Is this Ni Water Cold Iron suitable for crafting that dharma artifact?"
"Oh yes, now I remember," Li Xizhi replied, realization dawning on him, "Yes, of course. This will reduce some costs... When it's finished, I'll have someone send it home."
Li Xizhi implied that he would cover the expense of making the dharma artifact. Li Yuanjiao studied him for a moment before saying, "I'll leave it to you then. When I return home, I'll have someone send the cold iron here."
Li Xizhi nodded and said, "I'll try to gather some news about Situ Mo in the market and report back to the family. Please take care of Huai'er…"
He glanced at Li Chenghuai in his grandfather's arms, showing a hint of reluctance in his eyes. Rolling up the hem of his feathered robe, he searched his pockets but could not find anything to leave for the child.
In the end, he could only blurt out a single sentence.
"I'll choose one or two dharma artifacts and send them home for him later."
"Of course," Li Xuanxuan replied, still cradling his grandson tightly.
Li Yuanjiao added, "Your mother also gave you a younger sister in your absence. She has already condensed her Profound Scenery Chakra. Her name is Li Yuexiang, and she shows promising talent… I'll send her to visit you soon."
"What?!"
Li Xizhi was taken aback, unable to hide his surprise. He smiled wryly and thought to himself, So much for complaining that I didn't write to you when my wife gave birth to Huai'er! You didn't even bother to tell me I have a younger sister! And she's probably already seven or eight years old now…
Despite grumbling internally, he was delighted by the news. Of course, he dared not talk back to Li Yuanjiao and merely responded politely. Li Xuanxuan beamed with pride, mumbling something about 'like father, like son'.
After bidding their farewell, they fetched Kongheng from the side yard and set off into the night.
Li Xizhi escorted his family out of the prefecture and when he turned around, the two old men approached him with fawning smiles.
Resuming his courteous yet distant demeanor, he asked, "Does the Golden Tang Gate run any business in the market?"
Li Yuanjiao and his group did not linger, hastily departing on the wind. As they headed west, he worried that Situ Mo might be lurking in the shadows while they were flying out in the open. He glanced at Kongheng and asked, "Master Monk, Situ Mo is likely colluding with Buddhist cultivators in Zhao State to plot against us. You're a Buddhist cultivator of true Dao lineage, do you know of any way to protect us? I don't expect us to remain undetected, but I would like an early warning if those in Zhao State manage to deduce our whereabouts."
"Benefactor..." Kongheng replied, looking a bit ashamed.
"The methods of Zhao's Buddhist cultivators and their power of deduction with the support of Maha's power surpass my own. I can only rely on my Dao lineage to protect myself from their schemes and deductions... There's little else I can do..." he sighed dejectedly.
"No need to blame yourself, Master Monk," Li Yuanjiao reassured him. It had been a casual question, yet Kongheng's kindness stirred feelings of shame over his own perceived incompetence.
Li Yuanjiao nodded thoughtfully.
At least they can't deduce Kongheng… there's still some room for maneuver.
The group rode the wind until they reached the vicinity of Moongaze Lake, finally allowing themselves to breathe a sigh of relief. Mount Qingdu was peaceful. Its grand formation was intact, and the territories under their rule seemed tranquil, basking in the sunset.
Li Yuanjiao exhaled, and a young man in black flew over from the distance. It was Li Wushao, who had sensed their approach through their spiritual connection. He cupped his fist in greeting, landing respectfully before them.
"Wushao greets Master."
Li Yuanjiao nodded slightly as Kongheng excused himself and returned to the island where he stayed. Li Xijun and Li Xuanxuan descended on the mountain together.
Li Qinghong flew out to meet them, clad in her jade armor and carrying a spear behind her. As soon as the siblings met, they fell silent, though both were eager to share their updates. They eventually took turns recounting what had transpired during each other's absence.
"Zhang Yun? Zhang Huaide?" Li Yuanjiao asked skeptically.
