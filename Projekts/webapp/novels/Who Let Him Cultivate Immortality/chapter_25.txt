Chapter 25: A Bizarre Exchange List
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
Contribution points in the Dao Seeking Sect functioned as an internal currency, essential for purchasing items within the sect, eating in the cafeteria, and conducting trades with fellow disciples.
Besides these uses, contribution points were also needed for special rewards in the Task Hall.
For instance, the extremely popular yet unaffordable “One-Day Sect Master Experience in Dao Seeking Sect” allowed the redeemer to act as the Sect Master for a day. This included attending meetings with the elders, handling sect affairs, being addressed as the Sect Master, and enjoying the privileges of the highest leadership position within one of the Five Great Immortal Sects…
The benefits were numerous, but the required contribution points were so high that no one had managed to redeem this reward yet. Some senior brothers had even thought about pooling their resources for the experience but ended up fighting over who would assume the role of Sect Master. They were all eventually carried off to the Pellet Cauldron Peak for healing, attracting a crowd of onlookers.
Now, these senior brothers were on long-term missions outside the sect and hadn’t returned for quite some time.
Another example was the “Medicine King Elixir,” touted as a unique treasure brewed by the higher-ups of the Dao Seeking Sect. It strengthened the body, enhanced vitality, solidified the soul, and consolidated cultivation levels. Despite its high cost, it was extremely popular among the senior brothers and sisters.
During combat, just a sip could replenish energy and accelerate wound healing. Those who used it swore by its effectiveness.
There was also the “Airship Accident Insurance” available for just one contribution point.
“Wait, why is there Airship Accident Insurance?” Lu Yang found this term somewhat unsettling.
The senior brother tasked with assigning missions explained as if it were the most natural thing. “It’s quite normal. No mode of transportation is 100% safe. Even the airships operated by the Land of Gold Commerce can encounter accidents, like colliding with a powerful being, mechanical failures leading to crash landings, or pilots striking for higher pay… These are common incidents, but fortunately, there have been no casualties. The chairman of the Business Association, realizing the risk, suggested that passengers pay a small amount into a pool. If an accident happens, the association would compensate the passengers from this pool.”
“If no accident occurs, passengers only lose a trivial amount of money. But if something happens, they receive compensation for the inconvenience.”
“The chairman dubbed this model ‘risk guarantee,’ or ‘insurance,’ and promoted it extensively in other businesses.”
“But don’t worry, our Dao Seeking Sect won’t let our disciples down. We’re generous when it comes to insurance. We’ve already purchased various types of insurance for you upon your entry into the sect, including airship accident insurance. The one for sale in the rewards section simply increases the compensation amount.”
The senior brother’s expression conveyed, “We’re a righteous sect, unlike those life-and-death demonic sects. We provide all necessary insurances,” showing reliability.
“Development in the cultivation world is indeed rapid, even insurance is available now.”
Lu Yang couldn’t help but cringe a bit, recalling from his memories that in his previous life, insurance originated from maritime transportation, not realizing that in the cultivation world, it stemmed from airship transportation.
He felt that this kind of thing was too ominous and preferred to buy something else. In the cultivation world, a bit of superstition is necessary.
The senior brother seemed to hear Lu Yang’s thoughts and added, “However, a powerful being who studied cause and effect argued that purchasing insurance might establish a causal relationship with risks, thereby increasing the likelihood of those risks.”
“The Business Association flatly denied this possibility, and both sides argued for a long time without reaching a formal conclusion.”
“This topic is of great research interest in the cultivation world. If it’s concluded that there is a causal relationship, that powerful being will favor you. If there’s no causal relationship, the Business Association will favor you. Either way, it’s a win-win situation.”
Lu Yang thought to himself that if he proved there was a causal relationship, the Business Association might want his head.
“One contribution point can be exchanged for a hundred low-grade spirit stones, and one hundred twenty low-grade spirit stones can be exchanged for one contribution point.”
“Blood Drinking Flying Sword, two thousand contribution points. The longer it soaks in blood, the more powerful it becomes. Why does this weapon sound so unrighteous?”
The senior brother explained, “It doesn’t have to be soaked in human blood; pig, cow, or duck blood works too. Recently, the owner of a Sichuan hot pot restaurant in our sect complained that someone secretly soaked a Blood Drinking Flying Sword in their duck blood hot pot.”
“After an investigation, the culprit was caught and punished by being forced to drink a pot of spicy hot pot broth. I bet he won’t want to eat hot pot for the rest of his life,” the senior brother said with a peculiar expression, recalling the scene.
Lu Yang continued browsing: “A bottle of Fasting Pills with any flavor for one contribution point.”
“Ancient Barbecue Recipe, one hundred contribution points.”
“The Sword Levitation Array,” for twenty-five contribution points, was a practical choice. This array could be engraved on a weapon to allow it to hover behind the back, eliminating the need for a scabbard and enabling quick access. It also included a protective array to safeguard the sword against the elements. Lu Yang bought it without hesitation.
This semi-invisible array, once applied to the ancient sword, vanished like a droplet evaporating in the air, leaving the sword floating silently behind Lu Yang. He moved around, and the sword followed seamlessly without any delay.
“That’s a great item.”
“Strength of Ten Bulls Pill” was priced at a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand contribution points for various stages from the Foundation to the Nascent Soul. Crafted by the renowned alchemist Wu Ming, it granted the user immense strength, allowing them to sweep through armies. Despite being a product of Wu Ming, known for mixing poison with his pills, the description promised remarkable effects in combat. Lu Yang decided to buy one to test its effectiveness.
“Sorry to bother you, Peach Blossom Leaf, but could I borrow five contribution points? I’ll repay you after the next mission.” He asked, knowing that contribution points could be transferred among disciples.
Peach Blossom Leaf, who needed a significant amount of points for her purchases, didn’t mind lending five.
“Okay.”
Lu Yang promptly acquired a “Strength of Ten Bulls Pill.” The senior brother handed him a small porcelain bottle containing a golden pill that reflected a bright light in the sun, clearly no ordinary medicine.
“Meng Jingzhou, I’ve already promised to celebrate my successful Foundation establishment. I’ve reserved a table at the Hundred Fragrance Pavilion. Let’s go for a meal; it’s all your favorite dishes,” laughed Meng Jingzhou, also inviting Peach Blossom Leaf.
“Peach Blossom Leaf, would you like to join us?” Meng Jingzhou, being Peach Blossom Leaf’s senior by ranking second in their entry group, extended a warm invitation.
Peach Blossom Leaf felt that despite Lu Yang’s fear of heights, his tendency to tell untruths, and his secretive poisoning of her room, they had completed a mission together and could be considered friends.
“Let’s go.”
