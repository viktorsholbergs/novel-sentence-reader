Qingdu Peak.
Li Yuanjiao was cultivating in seclusion, healing his wounds. However, the Blood Sun Fruit needed to be delivered to Li Xizhi in Wubu Market of Libu Prefecture. With uncertainties surrounding Situ Mo's movements, the Li Family decided to send Kongheng to fulfill the task.
Li Xijun briefly mentioned the matter, to which Kongheng nodded and solemnly put the treasure into his chest pocket. He was a man who took promises seriously, committed to fulfilling them even if they were at the cost of his life.
Li Xijun's eyelids twitched as he asked, "Master Monk... they can't trace you, right?"
Seeing Kongheng nod in affirmation, Li Xijun finally realized that his Dao lineage truly emphasized on keeping promises. He saw Kongheng off with an amused smile at the border.
Yet, as he watched him leave, he sighed.
"Those who cultivated the ancient method are simple and honest, but those Buddhist cultivators who practiced the new way are cunning... The two could not be more different."
With this thought, Li Xijun smiled wryly, adding, "Then again, my family is also known for our cunningness…"
Initially planning to fly back to Mount Qingdu, Li Xijun changed his mind.
"It's been a long time since I saw Ximing. I wonder if he's been fooling around and neglecting his cultivation… I better go remind him."
He made a sharp turn in mid-air and landed on Mount Wutu. The scenery was lush on Wutu, and outside the forest courtyard and Alchemy Pavilion, a woman awaited, dressed in white and wearing a veiled hat that was adorned with pearls and jade.
Upon seeing Li Xijun land, the woman quickly removed her hat and said softly, "An greets Senior."
Li Xijun paused briefly, recognizing her as An Zheyan's daughter, Li Ximing's new wife, and his sister-in-law. He lowered his gaze and replied, "Sister-In-Law, there's no need for such formality."
An nodded and said softly, "Since Brother-In-Law is here, I'll take my leave."
Li Xijun nodded and then stepped into the cave dwelling in the backyard. Inside, Li Ximing sat, swallowing a flame from the furnace. Upon seeing Li Xijun, he exclaimed with delight, "Come, come, come!"
Li Xijun's spiritual sense swept through the area, and he immediately understood the situation.
His voice was filled with astonishment as he asked, "You've... broken through to the eighth heavenly layer?"
Li Ximing laughed, waving his hands dismissively as he replied, "I've been accumulating my strength for a while, and just happened to break through on a whim!"
Though Li Ximing spoke casually and with pride, Li Xijun understood him and the effort behind his achievement. He was clearly waiting to be praised, so Li Xijun complimented him a few times, eliciting a laugh from him before adding, "Take another Talisman pill, and you'll be able to break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, and the Foundation Establishment will be just within your reach."
"Of course," Li Ximing replied with confidence.
With a serious tone, he continued, "Once Uncle Jiao emerges from seclusion, we can choose an island to settle down overseas! Leave the family to me; I can handle it!"
I know you're too lazy to go overseas, Li Xijun grumbled inwardly.
"I saw An waiting outside. While she has a good temper, you shouldn't take her for granted. The An Family members are talented; An Zheyan has worked hard and made significant contributions over the years. You can't let her down," he reminded Li Ximing.
"Yes... of course… I do treat her very well! I'm always nice. I couldn't meet her just now because I was refining pills," he explained.
Li Xijun nodded, hesitating for a moment before finally asking, "What about Meng Zhuoyun? How do you plan to deal with her?"
Li Ximing paused, suddenly looking a bit awkward as he replied softly, "I've tried to persuade her many times. She refuses to give up on revenge and stay with me… I guess I'll just send her away when the times come. There's no need for further discussion on this matter..."
Seeing Li Xijun frown, Li Ximing quickly added, "I haven't treated her unfairly! I've given her all the resources she needed and imparted all the alchemy knowledge she should know. When the time comes, everything will balance out, and we can part ways without owing each other."
Li Xijun shook his head in disbelief.
"You! You're truly heartless... I don't think that's what she's after!."
"That..." Li Ximing began, feeling a mix of shock and irritation from having his affair exposed by his brother.
"That's nonsense! Who do you think she is? Our relationship is purely physical," he said with a sigh.
Li Xijun glanced at him and gently reminded, "If you're going to let her leave, then make sure she doesn't take anything that has our family's seal away with her. We don't want trouble in the future."
"That's true," Li Ximing replied absent-mindedly. With no further comment, Li Xijun departed.
Li Ximing straightened up, noticing several paintings scattered across the courtyard. He picked them up, examined each one closely, and then set them aside.
He spat out Long Marching Fire Essence. Meng Zhuoyun caused only a brief flutter of emotions in his heart, which he quickly dismissed and quickly forgot.
Libu Prefecture, Wubu Market.
In just three months, Li Xizhi had established control over the entire market and organized its rules and regulations. He won over several shop owners who were rogue cultivators, then made things easier for the shops owned by Xiao, Yuan, and Yang Families.
"With Azure Pond's support, taking over this place is straightforward. No one dares to defy me."
If it were not for Azure Pond and the backing of three prominent clans, it would have taken Li Xizhi ten times longer to gain this level of control. Now, after giving just a few orders, he could focus on his own cultivation properly.
According to the sect's unspoken rules, he could now take over many marginal profits. Concerned about giving others leverage against him, Li Xizhi chose to hold off.
Due to this, visitors were rare in the market. Wubu was not a large market. The disciples from the peaks were wary of it, and direct disciples were not interested in it. Hence, only Li Xizhi and the relevant families were here.
The spiritual energy here is far inferior to that of Azure Pond, but we are free and relaxed here, without the need for constant worry.
As he pondered these thoughts, someone approached and cupped his fist respectfully.
"My lord, the records for Golden Tang Gate are here," he reported with a bow.
Li Xizhi took the document and flipped through it, quickly locating information on Situ Mo, the current apparent head of the Golden Tang's main lineage, who should be the last survivor of a lineage that had been wiped out long ago.
Originally, the Golden Tang Gate was run by the eldest son, Situ Li, who had marriage ties with Profound Peak Gate. After the founder, Situ Tang, died, his second son, Situ Nu, supported by the Golden Feather Sect, killed his elder brother and took control, achieving the Purple Mansion Realm.
After Situ Nu's death, the Golden Tang Gate fractured into several factions. In the end, control was restored to those in the first lineage, who were aligned with the Azure Pond Sect. Those in Situ Nu's lineage were slaughtered, leaving only Situ Mo as the only survivor.
How complicated.
Li Xizhi skimmed through the document. He could clearly see the traces of conflict between Azure Pond and Golden Feather. As for the repeated massacres and struggles with the Golden Tang Gate, that was merely a show between the two sects.
They were all forced to do this. Otherwise, they wouldn't have bothered to secretly shelter Situ Mo.
Li Xizhi felt a jolt of surprise and turned to his subordinate.
"Where is Situ Mo now? What mission has he accepted?"
"I heard he has taken on a mission to the Eastern Sea and may not return for several years," the man replied respectfully.
"Continue," Li Xizhi encouraged, and the man went on to explain, "According to the cultivators from the Han, Fu, and He families who visited the market, the Kong Family of Profound Peak has sent two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to an overseas market. They've taken control of two more islands and blocked the sea route, causing the Golden Tang Gate's population to dwindle by more than half."
"The relationship between Profound Gate and Golden Tang was once very good, with no conflicts. However, it has soured in recent years, leading to this situation. In response, Golden Tang Gate has dispatched Situ Mo," he added.
