"Oh," Li Xuanxuan responded somewhat dejectedly.
He straightened his sleeves and sat on the mountain for a while, watching the two juniors chat. Feeling a bit restless, he decided to resume drawing talismans. The two juniors saw him off as he left.
Li Ximing sighed in relief and said, "Grandfather seems to be in better spirits now…"
Li Xijun nodded in agreement and responded softly, "Although the old man's cultivation isn't high, he's experienced much in his life. He's able to answer our questions now, especially on matters we thought had been buried in the sands of time. Seeing him in good spirits truly brings us some relief."
The two walked side by side. Li Ximing, dressed in a lavish golden Daoist robe, paused for a moment before speaking softly.
"I've only heard that Second Granduncle is a phenomenal archer, unrivaled in the world. With his golden bow, he's capable of great feats. If he can return, our home will be well-protected."
"I think that's unlikely. It's not easy for anyone to leave the southern border permanently," Li Xijun replied with a hint of thoughtfulness in his tone.
By the time both of them were born, Li Xuanfeng had already left for the southern border. Since Li Xijun had never met him, his understanding of this Second Granduncle was based on family records and stories from the elders.
Unlike Li Xuanxuan, his joy mostly stemmed from the idea that the family might finally have an elder in the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Now that he had calmed down and his initial excitement had faded away, he began reflecting thoughtfully on the situation.
Li Ximing seemed to be doing the same and asked in confusion, "Since the Second Granduncle has left the southern border, why hasn't he returned to visit home…? Is he on some kind of mission?"
"It seems likely," Li Xijun said with a nod as he paused, then hesitated before continuing, "I've heard that someone from the Ning Family married him. After all these years, perhaps he has children of his own now… That would make those children on the southern border our elders…"
"As for why he hasn't returned... The adults likely have their reasons. Maybe his family is being controlled so he's forced to obey the orders of Azure Pond," he speculated.
Li Ximing nodded and replied, "That makes sense."
The two paused, reflecting on the matter for a while before Li Ximing returned to Wutu Peak to continue his study of alchemy. Li Xijun wrote a letter to his aunt, Li Qinghong, who was in seclusion, and another to send to Zongquan Island. Then, he settled down to practice quietly.
Splitreed Island, Azure Pond Market.
Li Xuanfeng circled the sea, familiarizing himself with the terrain and gathering detailed information about Splitreed Island before returning to the market.
The spiritual energy of the earth veins on Splitreed Island was peculiar, making it impossible to set up formations on the island itself.
The Azure Pond Market was located on the seabed not far from the island. Li Xuanfeng investigated the earth vein and learned that the spiritual energy here was not any better, as the market had only been protected by a high-grade formation.
Splitreed Island itself was abundant in spiritual qi and was teeming with treasures and strange terrains. The island had many straits, some deep underground and shrouded in darkness, with vast, boundless spaces. It was said that these remnants were left behind from battles that were fought by immortals.
The island—in its entirety—functioned more like a vast entrance, connecting multiple valleys and straits. Cultivators gathered qi here, while devil cultivators also roamed the gorges, engaging in killings and looting. The deeper one ventured, the more chaotic and dangerous the environment became.
Li Xuanfeng walked around the island but did not venture too deeply, and he soon returned to the market quietly. Upon arrival, he found an Azure Pond cultivator waiting by his cave dwelling.
"Greetings, Daoist. My master would like to meet you and has been waiting for quite some time," the cultivator said respectfully.
Li Xuanfeng immediately recognized him as Ning Heyuan's subordinate. He nodded and followed him to Ning Heyuan's cave dwelling. The door was open, and rich spiritual qi flowed out freely.
Inside, Ning Heyuan was drinking.
"Brother-in-law, you're here!" Ning Heyuan greeted him with a slightly flushed face, as though he had drunk quite a bit.
He filled a wine cup to the brim and gestured for Li Xuanfeng to sit.
"Speaking of which, fate really likes bringing me and the Li Family together…" Ning Heyuan hummed.
Li Xuanfeng nodded, but thought silently to himself, Why is this guy acting so friendly now? Does he have a favor to ask of me?
He stared at Ning Heyuan, who suddenly appeared quite humble, almost like a junior in his presence.
Ning Heyuan continued politely, "When I visited Moongaze Lake with my aunt back then, I had hoped to seek guidance on swordsmanship from your esteemed family. I traded a few blows with Daoist Qinghong while we sparred on the mountain, and we exchanged names. I was overpowered and that was when I truly realized the strength of your family's Dao lineage."
Li Xuanfeng was taken aback by how humbly he spoke. He knew that Li Qinghong, as a Qi Cultivator, would never have been Ning Heyuan's match. At best, she could only evenly match him with her lightning spell. Ning Heyuan's words were likely intended to flatter the Li Family.
Li Xuanfeng smiled and said, "Brother, there's no need to be so modest. I'm well aware of Qinghong's strength… She's certainly not your opponent."
Ning Heyuan responded humbly to Li Xuanfeng's comment. Since the man had said so, he stopped beating around the bush and stated his business.
"Brother-in-law, I've heard of your reputation even overseas. The Daoist Master trusts you greatly... In the past hundred years, only a few have been as favored as you."
Li Xuanfeng was well aware of the trust Yuan Su had placed in him and silently awaited the rest of Ning Heyuan's intentions.
Sure enough, after a brief moment of hesitation, Ning Heyuan said, "Once you return, could you help me find out... how long I must remain in this Eastern Sea?"
Li Xuanfeng lowered his gaze and remained silent. Ning Heyuan grew a bit anxious, but his tone remained polite as he explained, "I've asked several times... but the Daoist Master refused to see me. I understand my mistake now... When I was younger, I was foolish, thinking that because the Ning Family had been allies of the Chi Family for a hundred years, I could do whatever I wanted with those under my family's governance."
His voice grew heavier as he continued, "After spending so many years in the Eastern Sea, I've come to realize that without the Daoist Master, our Ning Family is nothing but a servant to the Chi Family... I truly understand my mistake now. Please, Daoist, I ask you to speak to the Daoist Master on my behalf."
Li Xuanfeng looked at him. Ning Heyuan was talented, had mastered many spells and techniques, and should have been at the level of someone like Ning Wan. However, spending ten years in the Eastern Sea had hindered his reputation and delayed his cultivation.
Now, with a gloomy and slightly decadent expression, Ning Heyuan was a far cry from the proud figure he had once been.
Li Xuanfeng responded softly, "This matter is not urgent… I still have a year or so before I return. Fellow Daoist, please think carefully about how to word your request. I'll take a letter back for you."
Ning Heyuan was momentarily taken aback. Instead of speaking on his behalf, Li Xuanfeng offered to bring his letter back. He smiled wryly, realizing that Li Xuanfeng was not a simple man.
I've been too impatient! I need to take a more measured approach… First, I must build a good relationship with him and win his favor through the connection with my sister. I need a long-term plan!
Ning Heyuan then apologized, took a sip of wine, and nodded.
"Indeed, there's no rush. If the Daoist needs anything in the market, feel free to tell me."
Li Xuanfeng nodded and said, "I've just come from the southern border, and some information is difficult to gather there. If there's anything I need in the future, I'll be sure to trouble you again."
Ning Heyuan nodded repeatedly and quickly saw him out. Once Li Xuanfeng left, he returned to his cave dwelling, sat at the jade table, and reflected for a long while.
"I thought he was just a tool for the Daoist Master... but I did not expect him to be a falcon tamed by the old man! No wonder... No wonder he's been so favored by the Daoist Master, and even married Sister Mian despite his insignificant family background!"
Ning Heyuan recalled Li Xuanfeng's attire, aura, and Golden Age Longbow that had been tempered countless times. Combined with some recent rumors, he could not help but sneer.
"An armored man with eyes sharp as a hawk… seems like someone's luck is about to run out!"
