"Senior Sister Ge Shuang!"
"Senior Sister Ge Shuang!"
Bordering another arena, many male disciples were also gathered, constantly cheering and shouting, spraying saliva everywhere.
On top of the arena was a woman with a cold face and a graceful figure. The long sword in her hand constantly hummed with cold light.
"She dances with the sword like a fairy. Pretty good looking, too."
Chen Xun chuckled and looked towards Ge Shuang. It was indeed worth the trip.
"Old Ox, isn't she good-looking?"
"Moo~"
The big black ox nodded repeatedly. Yes, she's good-looking. It didn't even turn its head and kept staring, probably indicating that Chen Xun should not disturb it.
_A few minutes later._
"Oi, oi. How did that junior sister over there lose? I had high hopes for her!"
"Moo~~"
"Oh, old ox, look at her. She's crying after being defeated, hahaha..."
"Moo moo moo~~"
"And why is that short guy pretending now? It’s not like someone stole your rice! What would you know about that!"
"Moo!"
"Look quickly! A spirit beast! It's amazing. Really amazing."
Suddenly Chen Xun's expression changed, and he slapped the ground hard.
"Moo?" The big black ox was startled. What's wrong with Chen Xun?
"Old ox, don't you feel something is missing?"
"Moo? Moo!"
The big black ox shook its head… then nodded. Now that it thought about it, something did feel missing.
"Sunflower seeds!" Chen Xun slapped the black ox’s hinds this time around, realizing he had forgotten something very important.
"Moo moo?"
The black ox responded with a nudge. Why didn't you bring sunflower seeds? No wonder something felt off!
"Darn!" Chen Xun appeared regretful. "Let's grow sunflowers this year. Then, I'll roast them with my secret seasoning."
"Moo moo~~"
The big black ox agreed, licking its lips. That sounded about right.
Back to the sect's grand competition.
After the first battle was over, participants could choose whether to continue fighting or postpone their next match to the next day.
Those who lacked confidence in their strength naturally wanted to continue fighting. The intensity of the battles on the second day would be much fiercer than today.
The stronger participants, on the other hand, were not in a hurry. They needed time to recover back to their peak condition. There was no room for carelessness.
The sect's grand competition became increasingly heated, and even Chen Xun and the black ox moved closer to get a better look at the fights.
Day after day passed, and on the fifth day, the inner disciples officially joined the competition. Their arrival pushed the competition closer to its climax.
Currently, a man and an ox were mixed in with the cheering crowd, doing their part.
"Who else carries the hopes of the outer disciples but Senior Brother Bai Shi! Go, go! Senior Brother Bai Shi! Go, go! You are the best!"
Chen Xun raised a wooden sign and cheered loudly. His words attracted the attention of the disciples, who gave him thumbs up in agreement.
"Hey, fellow junior, isn't Senior Sister Ge Shuang also a star of the outer disciples?"
Several people approached with aggression in their tone. They felt that Ge Shuang was being undermined and shadowed.
"What nonsense are you spouting!" Chen Xun shot back and patted the black ox.
The big black ox understood, raising another sign in the air.
"Go, go! Senior Sister Ge Shuang! Cut down your enemies with your sword!"
Shocked, the disciples felt their scalp tingle. When they broke out of their stupor, they couldn’t help but raise their thumbs in appreciation.
The looks they sent Chen Xun conveyed a single word: Impressive!
Chen Xun's lips rose into a cocky smile and he continued to cheer with the big black ox.
With fluttering sleeves, the inner disciples started to leap onto the many stages. They carried cold focused expressions.
Immediately, faint killing intent started to spread from the arenas. The ancient trees around them rustled in the cold wind, and a few yellow leaves snapped and fell down slowly.
The martial platforms fell into silence, and even the prominent figures in the viewing stands had expectant expressions in their eyes.
**_Hiss—_**
Countless disciples gasped. These were the true future leaders of the Five Elements Sect, the ones who would lead the sect in the future.
Even the disciples below felt the imposing pressure and their expression turned serious.
"Moo~"
At this moment, the pair’s excitement couldn’t be contained anymore. The black ox let out low moos of thrill. It was truly amazing.
Chen Xun was somewhat disappointed that no one started boasting and shit-talking.
**_Swish!_**
**_Swish!_**
A bell rang through the mountain peaks signaling the official start of the sect's grand competition!
Countless sharp whistling sounds filled the air.
With no delay, everyone in the arenas activated their magical artifacts and circulated their spiritual energy, causing a riot of flashing colors to erupt.
**_Boom! Boom!_**
Each platform erupted into a fierce battle. Some unleashed flying swords that shadowed the sky. Others used their physical prowess to raise clouds of dust on the fighting grounds.
Some used spells that filled the arena with fog, making it impossible to see what was happening inside, but the continuous sound of metal clashes indicated the intensity of the battle.
Some disciples controlled formation flags and released puppets to join the fray.
Sword energy and spiritual power were everywhere. Everyone gave their all and held nothing back.
A violent whirlwind swept by the watching disciples and they had to release their spiritual power to defend against it.
"Wow... wow..."
Chen Xun's pupils contracted dramatically as he shook his head repeatedly. These Foundation Establishment stage disciples were terrifying. They were completely different from ordinary cultivators.
"Moo moo!" The big black ox also nodded repeatedly, shaking its head as it watched the dazzling array of spells.
The decisive battles lasted for two days and nights.
Chen Xun and the big black ox sat on the ground. They were unable to tear their eyes away from the fights. When they got hungry, they ate some biscuits.
In the end, Bai Shi and Ge Shuang stopped at the top hundred, causing the outer disciples to sigh. The foundation of the inner disciples was truly beyond what the outer disciples could compare to.
Finally, it was time for the sect elders to distribute rewards. They didn’t forget to say a few words filled with clichéd words to encourage the disciples.
As the important figures and elders of the Five Elements Sect left, this year's sect grand competition finally came to an end.
On the way down the mountain, Chen Xun and the big black ox burst into laughter, tittering.
"Old ox, that one inner disciple was quite sinister. Why did he attack his family jewels?"
Chen Xun watched the big black ox's butt and couldn't help but laugh. The best part was that the person on the other side had really fallen for it. His appearance after the hit was quite amusing, to say the least.
"Moo moo~~" The big black ox also kept shaking its head, reveling in the success of their prank.
"Next year, we should participate as well and make it to the top five hundred. We can earn some contributions that way."
"Moo!"
"Alright, let's go. First, let's grow some sunflower seeds."
"Moo~"
They jogged together with their laughter echoing through the mountains.
Back in the Medicine Valley, they first tended to the medicine fields and then secretly harvested a few spiritual herbs. They would cultivate the seeds and replant them.
"Old ox, I'll leave the spiritual herbs to you. I'll go and study sword control techniques."
"Moo~" The big black ox nudged Chen Xun forcefully; cultivating spiritual herbs was its specialty.
Chen Xun nodded and headed to his cave. He took out his immortal sword from his storage pouch and his eyes lit up.
Whether he could fly on it or not would be decided today. Chen Xun calmed his mind and started cultivating.
One month later, on a clear morning in the Medicine Valley, birds were singing, and the air was filled with a peaceful atmosphere.
Chen Xun and the black ox stood on an open field, with an immortal sword in front of them and a backpack on Chen Xun's back.
Chen Xun had made two parachutes himself to ensure safety; safety first in all things.
"Control the sword to ride the wind, roam freely between heaven and earth!"
Chen Xun made a strange hand gesture, and his turbid and unclear spiritual energy poured into the immortal sword. "Rise!"
The immortal sword slowly lifted off the ground, hovering half a meter above it, stirring up a cloud of dust.
"Moo! Moo!" The big black ox jumped up in excitement, continuously mooing.
"Old Ox, get on... Wait no, not on me! On the sword!"
Chen Xun's voice trembled, and his heart was beating rapidly. He was already beginning to imagine flying with their sword, traveling through these beautiful mountains and rivers.
