Xiao Yongling's previously calm expression was finally shadowed by a trace of gloom. The Eastern Feather Mountain formed from spiritual energy in the clouds began to move slowly, suppressing the flow of mana and weakening the power of Tang Shedu's halberd. The long sword in his hand radiated dazzling brilliance as he moved to block the attack head-on.
The ancestor of the Xiao Family, Xiao Xianyou, had met his end overseas years ago, unable to even put the Xiao Family's signature spell into use. The Xiao Family, relying on past connections, had begged a Daoist Master from the Purple Smoke Gate to cast a spell that projected the image of a circular ring, using it to inquire everywhere, but to no avail.
Decades later, Daoist Master Yuanwu had wielded a dharma artifact shaped like a ring on multiple occasions. The Xiao Family dared not confront him, but they harbored silent suspicions in their hearts. Now, Tang Shedu's words were like grinding the Xiao Family's face into the dirt.
This veiled insult, half-hidden and half-revealed, was far worse than mocking the Li Family by referencing Li Chejing's assignment to guard the southern borders. Earlier, it had been agreed that Xiao Yongling would hold back Tang Shedu, so he decisively invoked his Immortal Foundation, wielding his sword to intercept Tang Shedu's advance with full force.
Meanwhile, Tu Longjian communicated through spiritual sense. The black-and-red token in his possession erupted with raging gray flames, scorching Yu Muxian's defensive dharma shields with a sharp, hissing sound. Yu Muxian formed a lotus hand gesture with one hand to resist Tu Longjian's golden hammer, while his other hand summoned back the golden shields.
As the golden shields retreated, the raging flames surged forward. Tu Longjian raised an eyebrow and focused his spiritual sense, First, destroy the Heavenly Golden Cymbal above his head! With that artifact in place, Senior Yuanjiao cannot approach him. Coming from a family of sword immortals, he must surely have talisman swords!
With his spiritual sense commanding the flames, they surged upward and twisted toward Yu Muxian.
Yu Muxian carefully observed the fire and understood immediately, Six Ding Merging Fire Token! A flame that shortens life and injures vitality, used to destroy artifacts and purge evil. It disperses, incinerates, and annihilates, balancing yin and yang within the grotto heaven. It must be countered with the Water Mansion System.
From his sleeve, Yu Muxian flung out a jade bottle. Changing his hand gestures, he formed a seal—pressing his ring finger for Ren and his middle finger for Gui—then flicked his sleeve, releasing a pale blue glow.
The jade bottle tipped in mid-air, spilling a single drop of jade dew. When it collided with the blue glow, it burst into a roaring cascade of seawater, pouring down from the heavens. The Six Ding Merging Fire Token clashed with the torrent, and Yu Muxian lightly manipulated his spell to seize the advantage in controlling the battlefield's formation.
However, the gray flames, being Six Ding Merging Fire Token, burned the seawater completely. A precious spirit item had been expended just to fend off a single attack.
Yu Muxian showed no concern as the golden ring in the sky spun rapidly, intercepting streak after streak of golden light that streaked across the air like meteors. Li Xuanfeng, already having one arrow trapped within the ring, released new arrows condensed from astral gold. These arrows were also ensnared one by one within the golden ring, where they were ceaselessly ground down.
Simultaneously, Yu Muxian's eight golden diamond-shaped artifacts rushed forward, clashing violently with Tu Longjian's golden hammer. With the support of the Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifact, Binding Ring, Yu Muxian was able to forcibly stabilize the confrontation, holding Tu Longjian's powerful onslaught in check.
Tu Longjian's golden hammer spun back toward him, and flames surged upward from beneath his feet. At last, he ceased concealing his Immortal Foundation, activating the Molten Fiend Fire. Baleful flames erupted from the golden hammer, streaking upward in curling plumes.
The flames burned bright at their core, while their edges shimmered hazily, like flowers seen through a mist. They spun individually, swirling and dancing around Tu Longjian's body. With the emergence of these flames, the surrounding balance of yin and yang was disrupted, tilting heavily toward yang. The lotus blossoms around Yu Muxian flickered faintly, dimming and brightening as the hammer hurtled toward him.
Boom!
A powerful jolt numbed Yu Muxian's palm, causing him to lose control of his hand seals. The lotus petals around him scattered like willow fluff caught in the wind. Tu Longjian's Immortal Foundation had disrupted the yin-yang equilibrium, seizing the advantage to shatter Yu Muxian's spell entirely. A hint of alarm crept into Yu Muxian's heart, Molten Fire… Merging Fire… Why are all of these flames meant to destroy golden artifacts?
Just as he began to move his fingers again, Tu Longjian's second hammer strike came in rapid succession, aiming directly at the Heavenly Golden Cymbal floating above Yu Muxian's head.
Yu Muxian's spiritual sense throbbed painfully. A glance from the corner of his eye revealed the gray Merging Fire closing in from behind at great speed. He immediately made a decision, Li Xuanfeng can no longer harm me, and the Heavenly Golden Cymbal cannot locate him. Better to abandon it than waste my strength maintaining it.
With this thought, Yu Muxian allowed Tu Longjian's hammer to strike the cymbal and focused instead on summoning the Binding Ring.
The Binding Ring, already sluggish from enduring over a dozen arrows, swirled with golden astral energy coursing through its circumference. Yu Muxian took advantage of this, directing the artifact downward to suppress the incoming Merging Fire.
In an instant, the Merging Fire and the astral gold clashed violently within the Binding Ring, creating a chaotic spectacle. Dense smoke erupted as gold and fire intertwined, scattering red-hot sparks and molten streams in all directions. Several bursts of thick smoke spewed out, leaving faint scorch marks on Yu Muxian's robes.
Yu Muxian's tactic was masterful. The Merging Fire and astral gold wore each other down within the Binding Ring, consuming each other's power. Without hesitation, he formed a new hand seal and summoned his six golden shields, redirecting them to intercept Li Xuanfeng's attacks.
Yu Muxian calculated the situation carefully, confident in his strategy. Xiao Yongling was no match for Tang Shedu. As long as he held the line here, the ultimate victor would undoubtedly be his side.
It all depends on whether the Six Gold Spirit Plate can hold firm against Li Xuanfeng! he thought.
However, his face turned slightly pale as the Heavenly Golden Cymbal above him shattered completely, breaking into fragments that dissolved into streams of light. Yu Muxian turned his focus to directing the golden diamond-shaped artifacts to hold off Tu Longjian, but his expression darkened again.
Tu Longjian, now enveloped in roaring flames, swung his hammer with overwhelming force. One of Yu Muxian's golden artifacts was struck and sent flying dozens of zhang away. The hammer struck again and again, scattering the other artifacts in all directions with unstoppable momentum. It seemed as though nothing could stand in its way.
To make matters worse, the sharp buzzing noise returned to Yu Muxian's ears, stabbing painfully and making him feel as though blood might begin to flow. He stepped back, raising the six golden shields for defense.
Boom!
A thunderous collision resounded as a heavy force struck Yu Muxian from the side. The shield covering his flank trembled slightly, seemingly withstanding the blow without major damage.
Yu Muxian wiped the blood trickling from his ears. Yet, instead of feeling reassured by the shields' resilience, his heart sank further. Scanning the situation with his spiritual sense, he was startled by what he saw.
Crack…
The shield staggered for only a moment before a sharp cracking sound echoed. A fracture line slowly emerged on its reverse side. Yu Muxian frowned in confusion, "This should not be possible… The attack was sharp and forceful, but it should not have been enough to fracture a Six Gold Spirit Plate with a single blow…"
However, the chaos on the battlefield left him no time to ponder further. He could only desperately fend off Tu Longjian's relentless assault, all the while glancing skyward. Overhead, the two Purple Mansion Realm spirit artifacts were locked in a fierce duel, seemingly determined to outmatch one another.
The Six Ding Merging Fire Token, requiring no direct control, continuously spewed out gray flames like a vast gray river surging forward. Meanwhile, the Binding Ring spun in mid-air, absorbing the Merging Fire as if it were a whale drinking deeply. The ring's surface had already turned faintly red from the intense heat.
Within the Binding Ring, alternating flashes of gold and red lit up intermittently. Black smoke erupted from time to time as the two spirit artifacts fought viciously, now beyond the control of their respective wielders.
