Chi Zhiyun noticed Duanmu Kui cupping his fist respectfully toward the clouds. Yet Chi Zhiyun saw no one among the clouds, leaving him both surprised and slightly confused. He then turned to Chi Wei and asked, "Ancestor, what's going on..? Could it be that a Golden Core Realm cultivator from another state has arrived?"
"Not at all." Chi Wei shook his head and activated his divine ability, glancing at the two vague figures in the clouds. He swept his eyes across them briefly, not daring to let his gaze linger, and turned to explain to Chi Zhiyun.
"To break through to the Golden Core Realm, the key lies in refining that indestructible metallic essence, and then using it to catalyze a divine ability to achieve the Golden Core. Duanmu Kui is adept in shamanic spells, and even if he can't form a Golden Core, he can still refine this metallic essence. Those two are emissaries of death, ensuring that should Duanmu Kui fail and his soul escape, the metallic essence won't transform into a monstrous force."
Chi Zhiyun, having read the scriptures within his sect, naturally understood that the metallic essence of the Golden Core was not the metal of the five elements, but instead symbolized the indestructibility of metal.
He was greatly puzzled and exclaimed, "Are there really such benevolent people?"
"It's a necessity." Chi Wei sighed softly and said, "You, being young, do not know how many spirit veins of mountains were broken and how many powerful beings—from Golden Core Realm to beyond—died in the ancient battles between immortals and devils… Those beings had all refined the metallic essence, turning into various fiends. Inflicting suffering upon the living is one thing, but these fiends retain traces of metallic essence... naturally, it stirs envy in others. So, the immortals established a supreme sect dedicated to capturing these creatures... Nowadays, it's one of the few upper sects that has never hidden away from the world, always shrouded in mystery."
While Chi Wei spoke, Duanmu Kui's five divine abilities in the sky had merged into a ray of colorful light, spewing invisible flames. Witnessing this, the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators stepped back in awe and were dumbstruck, while Duanmu Kui continued to refine his powers within these invisible flames.
"Duanmu Kui is taking the path of balancing water and fire, a method now rarely seen… Having received techniques granted by an immortal, he's more confident using these ancient methods," Chi Wei remarked while Zhiyun, not quite understanding his explanation, simply stared blankly at the radiant display of divine abilities.
On the other hand, Chi Wei nodded thoughtfully, focusing intently on the scene before him.
No one in the Wu and Yue States had achieved the Golden Core Realm for hundreds of years. The few known methods for breaking through the Golden Core Realm had led to the deaths of many Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, leading to an agreement among them to invite juniors to witness their breakthroughs—a mutually beneficial arrangement in the hopes of finding the right method for advancement.
Everyone watched intently, but one of the vague figures in the clouds shook their head.
In a high-pitched voice, the figure said, "He has the Locust Shade Ghost life divine ability, so he should have cultivated the Emperor's Mandate instead of Fool's Mountain Chase..."
"Exactly, Duanmu Kui likely has no hope left… Let's prepare to intervene."
As the two conversed, nobody below them could hear their voices. The invisible fire in the air blazed even fiercer, using the divine abilities as kindling, faintly condensing a bright point of light.
All the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators widened their eyes in envy as they watched the spirit light. Duanmu Kui pushed his palm forward, and the essence of the sun and moon surged toward that light.
Slowly, a few ethereal dewdrops appeared above the glimmering spirit light, shimmering beautifully and dripping down. The light grew even brighter, but suddenly, the dewdrops ceased. After about the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the five divine abilities had been fully consumed, and no more dew fell.
"Ah…" Chi Zhiyun watched, puzzled, while Chi Wei had already lowered his head in disappointment. The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators looked at each other, their hearts pounding as they gazed at Duanmu Kui.
Duanmu Kui paused for a moment, then inhaled sharply. Like a whale, he swallowed the entire spirit light into his belly. A complex expression flickered across his face before he burst out laughing. His voice was unexpectedly high-pitched, filled with triumph and satisfaction.
"I've succeeded!"
Chi Zhiyun looked up in shock to see Duanmu Kui's face streaked with fine lines, resembling a cracked porcelain doll. He shivered at the unnerving sight.
Meanwhile, Duanmu Kui continued laughing loudly. Witnessing this odd phenomenon, Chi Wei was greatly alarmed and immediately pulled Chi Zhiyun back by several li.
"Let's go!"
The other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators also quickly fled without looking back. The two figures in the sky appeared before him quickly, and the one with a sharper voice called out to him fiercely.
"Duanmu Kui!"
Duanmu Kui, oblivious, continued to rub his face. His skin was now flaking off in pieces and chunks, revealing the bone beneath. The spirit lights of his spells had faded, transforming into rising wisps of ghostly light instead.
"Duanmu Kui!"
The figure called his name out three more times before exchanging a glance with his companion. He then sighed softly.
"Who are you?!"
Duanmu Kui then looked up, his facial skin now grotesquely shredded, revealing an eerie, skeletal face beneath. He chuckled darkly and let out a piercing shriek that reverberated through the vast sky.
"I am… the Locust Shade Ghost!"
Li Tongya sat solemnly in a chilly secret chamber, holding a warm jade stone in his hand. He had been overseeing Mulu Town for the past few days, waiting to return home once order was restored. His spiritual sense occasionally swept over various locations, vigilant for any disturbances.
The Li Family had scavenged three Qi Cultivation Realm treasures from the entirety of Eastern Mount Yue, one of which was the jade stone in his hand. Known for stabilizing qi and enhancing concentration, it also expedited cultivation and was thus effective for Qi Cultivators. Hence, it was promptly sent to Li Tongya.
The other two items were a Qi Cultivation Realm longsword and a small shield which Li Tongya gave to Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanfeng respectively, providing Li Xuanxuan with a Qi Cultivation Realm dharma artifact.
"In addition to the spirit fields and manpower of Eastern Mount Yue, the family has also amassed a significant collection of spirit items and dharma artifacts over the years, much to the delight and benefit of the younger generations."
Li Tongya immersed his spiritual sense into his Qihai acupoint, where his cultivation at the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm manifested as a swirling mass of white qi.
Beneath the ethereal veil of white qi lay a calm lake, its water formed by his condensed true essence. Thanks to the blessing of the Deep Ocean Long Whale Talisman and River One Qi Technique, the lake was as vast as an ocean instead.
Li Tongya, who had yet to show signs of forming an immortal foundation, had read the River One Qi Technique back and forth over a dozen times, memorizing its crucial points.
He estimated that it would take about another decade for him to establish his immortal foundation. As he concentrated on his cultivation, a piercing scream interrupted his thoughts and cut through his silence. It was so loud that it echoed through his mind.
"I am… Locust Shade Ghost!"
Li Tongya, who was deeply engrossed in meditation, was immediately jolted from his state by the unexpected shriek. He instantly turned pale as he exhaled a frustrated and alarmed breath, his mind racing to discern the source of the disturbance.
Who was that?!
After briefly regulating his breathing, Li Tongya pushed open the stone door and ascended into the sky, where he saw several younger Qi Cultivators of the Li Family with grim expressions on their faces.
Chen Donghe, Li Xuanfeng, and others stood aloft in silence, looking westward.
Li Tongya looked toward the west, where dark clouds swarmed the sky and thunder boomed. Brilliant bursts of mana light flickered continuously from within the cloud, resonating with loud explosions.
This all caused his heart to skip a beat as he murmured, "This day has arrived earlier than expected… It seems that the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue might be breaking through to the Golden Core Realm. However… it's uncertain whether this phenomenon indicates success or failure."
Li Xuanfeng joined him, his expression grave. The Golden Age Longbow on his back glistened in the sunlight as he said to Li Tongya, "Judging by the days, it's likely that the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue is attempting to break through to the Golden Core Realm… However, given the current scene, it appears there may be a battle happening above."
"Mount Wu will disperse, and the territory of Mount Yue will fall into the hands of Azure Pond Sect…" Li Tongya paused, then added in a low voice, "As for why there is a battle, it might be that the Purple Mansion Realm cultivator of Mount Yue has enemies seeking revenge. These matters are common for high-level cultivators and are not of our concern. However, we should inform the Xiao Family of this news… Donghe, you fly to the prefecture and notify the Xiao Family."
"Understood," Chen Donghe replied with a nod before flying eastward along the Guli Road right away.
Li Xuanxuan, who had been standing nearby, nodded in response to the news, his expression tinged with worry.
"According to the Xiao Family, the territories of Mount Yue will be divided among the Mount Yue Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators aligned with Azure Pond Sect… However, it is uncertain which Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators adjacent to our family will take control. The situation on the lake is about to change again..."
