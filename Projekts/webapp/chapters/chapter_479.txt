Azure Pond Sect.
In the bamboo forest atop Qingsui Peak, a young man clad in feathered robes sat cross-legged. As a gentle breeze stirred, he opened his eyes, a smile slowly spreading across his face.
"I've mastered the Dawn Imperial Movement!"
The Dawn Dew Gathering Technique was a cultivation method perfected over five hundred years by the Azure Pond Sect. It came with a complete set of techniques and was considered one of the best among Grade Four techniques. Li Xizhi was one of those who practiced it, particularly the levitation technique it included.
Unfortunately, this method could only be cultivated to the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Every disciple of the Azure Pond Sect aspired to reach the Purple Mansion Realm. Since this technique offered no benefits in alchemy or smithing, very few chose to practice it.
Li Xizhi had often been looked down upon by his peers for following this path, but he never took it to heart, focusing only on his cultivation.
Rising to his feet, a six-colored aura of vibrant energy swirled beneath him, lifting him into the air. Clad in a black feathered robe gifted to him by Yang Xiao'er, he truly appeared like an immortal.
Flying above Qingsui Peak for a while, he felt quite satisfied with himself.
With the River Crossing Torrential Step for quick movement and the Dawn Imperial Movement for levitation, even a peak Qi Cultivator would have a hard time killing me. Once I master the Six-Colored Essence Evasion, I will hardly have to fear any danger while traveling outside with a few talismans on hand.
Looking at the swirling six-colored qi beneath his feet, he sighed regretfully.
Everything about this technique is excellent, except for its brilliance. It is far too conspicuous… Anyone can tell it is a mystical technique at a glance—definitely not discreet enough.
Li Xizhi chuckled at his own dissatisfaction and descended on the wind, only to see Yang Xiao'er flying toward him, holding a tiny storage pouch in her hand.
At the start, she had been anxious, but Li Xizhi had always treated her kindly, and over time, the girl had grown more at ease in his presence. She was now smiling radiantly, her eyes filled with affection for him.
"My dear, there is news from home!" Yang Xiao'er announced happily.
Li Xizhi quickly took the pouch, probing it with his spiritual sense. He found three jade boxes sealed within. After reading the small letter tucked inside, he fell silent.
Yang Xiao'er stepped forward and asked softly, "What does it say?"
Li Xizhi led her back down to the bamboo forest, taking her hand and speaking in a low voice, "Things at home have gone well. It seems I will need to make a trip to Fuchen Peak and see if I can make a connection there... After all, that person is a peak Foundation Establishment Realm alchemist."
Yang Xiao'er pursed her lips and said, "Li Encheng has a strange temper and has never aligned himself with any faction... Making amends is one thing, but it will not be easy to build a connection with him. You might end up humiliated instead…"
The Azure Pond Sect was a grand sect with a five-hundred-year history and a colossal presence in Yue State. It dominated the southern two prefectures and the Azure Pond Mountain Range, influenced the five gates to the east, and suppressed the thriving Changxiao Gate to the west. In border regions like Moongaze and Lixia, it maintained control through heavy taxes and bloodshed. Every territory was strictly governed, and the sect's stability was unrivaled.
However, within the Azure Pond Sect, factions flourished. The Yuan Xiu and Yuanwu factions were the largest, but many smaller factions existed as well. Peak masters, elders, and Daoist Masters were locked in constant power struggles, with Sect Master Chi Zhiyun barely managing to maintain a precarious balance.
"No, I still have to try."
Li Xizhi thought carefully and responded, "The Chi Family's numbers are dwindling within the sect. They have been relying on the Ning Family to control the various peaks, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to face the Yuanwu faction. Furthermore, the recent imbalance in the distribution of resources from the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven has only led to more provocations from Yuan Xiu's side… Chi Zhiyun has been sidelined for the most part and cannot manage everything."
With a slight pause, he continued, "If I want my family to have a foothold in Yue State through the Azure Pond Sect, I need to build a few connections here. At the very least, I want us to be seen as dogs, not just fodder. This is a great opportunity—I cannot afford to miss it!"
Yang Xiao'er gazed at him with concern, her ordinary features brought to life by the tenderness in her eyes.
"But… Master's Yuan Family belongs to the Daoist Master Buzi's lineage. My family's status is delicate; we have never dared to form alliances. If you go through with this…"
Yang Xiao'er hesitated and the rest of her words were left unspoken.
The Yuan Family's ancestor made a mistake in his youth and was exiled from the sect. His time is almost up now, and their influence within the sect weakens by the year. If there were any favors left, Master would have already introduced me to the people of Tianzi Peak!
Li Xizhi understood her concern. Yuan Tuan had hinted at this multiple times in private, but it was not something he could say aloud. Instead, he simply assured, "Do not worry. Master is also on the peak."
Hearing this, Yang Xiao'er realized that Yuan Tuan must have had a hand in this as well, so she said nothing more and simply nodded in agreement.
Li Xizhi flew off from Qingsui Peak, his thoughts running through everything twice over. "Granduncle has gained the favor of a Daoist Master in Yi Mountain City, and he already has the Ning Family backing him… But Daoist Master Yuan Su always keeps to himself in Yi Mountain City, never meddling in sect affairs…"
Li Xizhi knew that the Ning Family held his own family in high regard, but he still did not consider relying on them as the best option.
If I can establish a relationship with Li Encheng, everything will fall into place. My family needs a voice of its own in the Azure Pond Sect. Afterward, we can align with the Ning Family in a cooperative manner, rather than becoming their vassals…
He understood the vast difference in status between them. After drifting in the clouds for a while, he descended in front of Fuchen Peak. A young Daoist boy from the peak approached and asked, "May I ask if the immortal seeks pills? What guidance do you require?"
Li Xizhi dared not act with arrogance. He cupped his fist and said softly, "Li Xizhi of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake, I am here to pay my respects."
He did not mention Qingsui Peak but instead came under the name of the Li Family, subtly implying that if he could not even get past this gate, he might as well give up and leave.
The Daoist boy went up to report, and soon the clouds and mist of the formation parted. Li Xizhi landed on the peak and saw the ground covered in a crimson hue, not knowing how many fire veins lay buried beneath it. Jagged boulders were scattered about, and the palace ahead stood tall and proud, resembling a massive cauldron.
He entered the great hall respectfully. Seated at the head of the room was a tall, thin old man in white robes, his frame gaunt. He was holding a white jade wine jug, drinking to his heart's content.
Upon seeing Li Xizhi, the old man frowned deeply and spoke bluntly, "The Li Family..? I have never had dealings with your clan. What business do you seek with me?"
Li Xizhi noticed the man's impatience and his heart sank. Still, he kept his tone humble and deferential as he said, "Xizhi greets Peak Master. I have heard that a Mount Yue cultivator from Moongaze Lake often gathered precious herbs for you…"
Li Encheng paused for a full breath, then finally remembered, "Ah, yes… that is true."
Li Encheng's thin cheeks twitched as he frowned and drank. Li Xizhi continued, "That Mount Yue cultivator recently broke through to the late stage of Foundation Establishment Realm and became quite arrogant. A few days ago, he intruded upon my family's territory and was slain by my family in alliance with the Yuan Family. I have come to inform the Peak Master of this matter."
"And I thought it was something important!"
Li Encheng had nearly forgotten about this person. The smell of alcohol hung heavy around him as he waved his hand dismissively and said, "So, he is dead. It makes no difference, really. At most, it will just take a bit more time to find more herbs. You did not need to make this trip… Now, go back!"
Li Xizhi quickly responded, "My family feels deeply remorseful and wishes to make amends to the Peak Master…"
"Oh?"
Li Encheng then took a slow sip of wine, his eyes narrowing into a smile as he asked, "How do you propose to make amends?"
Li Xizhi kneeled and respectfully replied, "My Li Family resides by the lakeside, with Mount Dali behind us, the great desert to the west, Xu and Zhao States to the north, and the sea to the east. We have many opportunities to acquire various spirit treasures. If the Peak Master has any needs, my family would be honored to handle them on your behalf!"
