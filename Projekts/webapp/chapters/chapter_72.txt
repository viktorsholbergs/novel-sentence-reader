Li Tongya descended the mountain, pondering over Xiao Chuting’s words.
What did he mean? If the Xiao Family is aware that the Golden Tang Gate is advancing south, why does the Azure Pond Sect remain passive and allow the Golden Tang Gate to wreak havoc at the Mushroom Forest Plains?
Realization then dawned upon him, causing his heart to skip a beat.
“Oh no, if the Wan Family falls, the Ji Family will corner us at Mount Dali. The fate of our families are intertwined. I’m sure Xiangping will use the mirror to assist them. I wonder how things are now. I better hurry home. The Mushroom Forest Plain must be a battlefield by now, and a detour would take too long. It’s best to wait two or three days for a direct route back,” he told himself.
While Li Tongya slowly knitted his brows in deep thought, a familiar voice called out to him. “Brother Tongya!”
Startled, he turned around and saw Xiao Yongling hurrying toward him, grabbing his hand. “It’s been ages since we last saw each other! Why didn’t you look for me while you’re here at Xiao Residence? I’ve been hanging around near that tavern for days, but I didn’t see you or Brother Wan. Where is he anyway?”
Li Tongya sighed softly and replied, “When I left home to come here and passed by the Wan Residence, I noticed that Wan Yuankai wasn’t home. Then I heard about the Golden Tang Gate’s push southward. They might have already breached Mount Huaqian. I’m worried about Brother Wan’s safety…”
Xiao Yongling wore a sad expression on his face and sighed deeply. “Ah, fate is as unpredictable as the weather. There’s nothing we can do about it.”
As they chatted and strolled through the market at the foot of the mountain, Xiao Yongling broached the subject of cultivation. “I’ve heard Brother Tongya has reached the Jade Capital stage for years and is on the verge of breaking through to the Nascent Spirit stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. What technique are you planning to use for your Qi cultivation, and which spiritual qi of heaven and earth do you intend to absorb?”
Li Tongya let out a wry smile and replied, “To be honest, our family only possesses a Grade Two technique manual—the Heavenly Essence Qi Cultivation Technique, which uses Minor Pure Spiritual Qi. We lack the means to harvest this type of spiritual qi and will likely need to purchase it from the market. It’s quite a headache.”
Xiao Yongling was taken aback by his reply. Having grown accustomed to making schedules to consume pills, custom-made dharma artifacts, and freely chosen cultivation techniques ever since he was young, Xiao Yongling found Li Tongya’s situation beyond his comprehension, leaving him momentarily speechless.
Li Tongya did not seem to notice his reaction as he was mulling over the year’s yield. Taking out two hundred jin for tributes, he had a surplus of more than two hundred and sixty jin of Spirit Rice and seven White Essence Fruits, which totaled up to about four Spirit Stones in value.
Additionally, the three Wuzha Worm Worms at home had produced silk twelve times over five years, spun into three silk cottons worth half a Spirit Stone.
Despite studying the Spiritual Talisman Method manual left by Li Chejing for five years, Li Tongya had only begun to grasp some techniques and achieved success once or twice. Given the high failure rate, he still hesitated to waste the expensive talisman papers.
Li Tongya and Li Xiangping had always managed their household funds meticulously. They had learned that one Spirit Stone could purchase thirty talisman papers. Given that three talismans of the Embryonic Breathing Realm typically cost one Spirit Stone, they calculated that they needed at least one successful talisman out of every ten attempts just to break even on their investment in talisman paper alone, without even considering the cost of talisman ink. This led them to be extremely cautious about how they utilized their resources.
While Li Tongya was searching for a place to sell the spirit items he had in his possession, Xiao Yongling interjected with a look of concern on his face, “This Minor Pure Spiritual Qi is usually sold at about thirty Spirit Stones. Do you have enough, Brother Tongya?”
Li Tongya shook his head and answered, “Well, I’m not in a rush to get it. The cost of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi could deplete a few decades of my family’s savings. I’ll just slowly accumulate Spirit Stones. Since the lifespan of a cultivator in the Embryonic Breathing Realm is typically a hundred and twenty years, I have ample time.”
Xiao Yongling gazed at him in shock, then remarked softly, “Your talent is commendable, considering that you have condensed the Jade Capital Chakra at the age of thirty and are on the verge of attaining the Qi Cultivation Realm. It’s a shame that your potential is hindered by your family background… If you were born in an affluent clan, you’d surely excel far beyond me!”
Li Tongya raised his eyebrow, chuckling at Xiao Yongling’s sentiment, and replied, “Hahaha, what are you talking about? Life’s challenges are what binds a family together. Despite our family’s current hardship, it is our ancestors’ savings over centuries that offered us this slim chance at immortality. I’m not burdened by my family, instead, it’s more like my family’s legacy is what enables me to be here today.”
Xiao Yongling smiled and nodded. “That makes sense. I’ve learned something today.”
Li Tongya shook his head and smiled. He scanned the market stalls, then asked, “Brother Yongling, I’m curious about the price of these qi cultivation techniques…”
“For basic or common cultivation methods, you can find them at stalls for less than a few Spirit Stones,” Xiao Yongling replied, then pointed toward a nearby building and continued, “However, for techniques of second grade or above, you’ll have to go to shops. They are sold for a price between dozens or even hundreds of Spirit Stones. Some shops bundle the manual along with their required spiritual qi of heaven and earth, thus saving you the time to collect the qi, but it’ll be a lot more expensive. Of course, there are also ancient or secret techniques that come in fluctuating prices, depending on the seller.”
Li Tongya furrowed his brow and asked, “Ancient or secret techniques?”
Xiao Yongling smiled and explained, “All techniques stem from a single qi. Some cultivation methods become obsolete if the specific qi they require is lost or the environment producing such qi is destroyed, making the qi unobtainable. Such techniques, lacking the necessary qi, are deemed ancient techniques.”
Seeing that Li Tongya was listening intently, Xiao Yongling smiled and continued, “There’s also another type known as secret techniques, where families modify ancient techniques to work with available qi.”
Li Tongya nodded, feeling enlightened, and said, “That sounds like a great idea.”
Xiao Yongling shook his head and expressed his concerns with a smile, “But rushed modifications can lead to weaker techniques with potential flaws, they can never compare to those that are refined over centuries. Our Xiao Family has some such secret techniques. They’re either slow to cultivate or require continuous medicinal support.”
“I see.” Li Tongya nodded in understanding. “Regardless, I can’t afford any of them with my current resources.”
Xiao Yongling shook his head and replied earnestly, “Don’t underestimate yourself, Brother Tongya. Your discipline and your younger brother’s exceptional talent will surely elevate the Li Family's status in time.”
Li Tongya politely thanked him, yet his mind was burdened with heavy thoughts.
The Azure Pond Sect’s actions are concerning. There must be many secrets behind the ambush and murder of the immortal mansion’s disciple. I hope Jing’er remains safe in the sect and doesn’t get involved in anything bad.
