As one of the top five peaks of Azure Pond Sect, Yuanwu Peak towered twice as high as the nearby Qingsui Peak, overlooking various other immortal peaks below. Misty clouds swirled all around, and being the first peak for weapon forging, fire veins surged intermittently. Occasionally, cultivators ascended and descended, creating a lively scene.
In a hidden cave on Yuanwu Peak, the spiritual qi was dense, and a spirit spring gushed forth. The dark stones stood out vividly against the white spiritual mist while a crystal jade table sparkled with brilliance, holding a pot of wine and two jade cups.
On the left was a person dressed in white and wearing a jade crown. He had a handsome appearance and an ethereal demeanor, exuding an otherworldly aura. He held a jade cup, portraying a celestial elegance, and said with a beaming smile, "This Foundation Establishment Realm is indeed different. From now on, it will nourish life and extend my lifespan by three hundred years, granting me some divine abilities!"
The person on the right had an ordinary appearance. He nodded contentedly as he heard those words, paused, and said, "Muxian, you endured the pain of flesh and blood falling away for these twenty years, and finally, you have made it through."
"It was just a small ordeal…" Yu Muxian chuckled as he waved his hand dismissively, his expression resolute with a faint smile. "Senior Brother Tang, I only wish to cultivate divine abilities and seek the metallic essence. No matter how many hardships I face, I am willing to endure all of them. Although cultivating the Molten Metal Cave is painful, it directly points to the Dao of the Purple Mansion Realm… Nothing can replace it."
Senior Brother Tang nodded respectfully and spoke softly, "Since you have achieved Foundation Establishment Realm, should you send a letter home? I have not seen you contact the Yu Family for some time."
"No need!"
Yu Muxian's expression was cold, his aura of immortality imposing as he said sternly, "Chi Zhiyan deliberately told Yu Mugao some things to scare him. It has been years since he wrote to me. My big brother is always cunning and has probably seen through my words, no longer trusting me. Yu Yufeng is already dead, and the Yu Family has lost its influence on the lake. They can't provide me with Foundation Establishment Realm elixirs, and even daily supplies are becoming scarcer. The Yu Family has lost its usefulness… I just hope they do not drag me down."
Senior Brother Tang did not feel surprised at these words and only furrowed his brow, asking, "Why not uplift the Yu Family and scour the lake's resources for yourself?"
"No." Yu Muxian shook his head and replied, "Xiao Chuting is the best at scheming, and his immortal foundation is bizarre. I do not want to confront him. Supporting the Yu Family would only bring more trouble than benefits; it is something wise people would not do."
Senior Brother Tang suddenly understood as he took a sip of the spirit tea, and asked, "I see that you are thinking things through carefully. How do you plan to proceed? Just give the orders, and though I may not have a strong cultivation, I do have some connections."
Yu Muxian pondered for a few breaths and replied, "The situation on the lake must not change… This is the result of multiple compromises. The fate that Wrathful Maha wants to take is getting closer, and the eyes of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators are all focused on it. We should not make any moves. When Li Tongya crosses the river and the major matters of the Purple Mansion Realms are settled, I will stabilize the lake's affairs without major changes."
Senior Brother Tang fell silent for a moment and replied, "You mean we should bide our time for now…"
"Exactly."
Yu Muxian nodded slowly and continued softly, "The current Jiangnan appears bright, but hidden currents run deep. To the north is the Maha Reincarnate, and to the south is the shaman. Though the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators are respected, they are only small pieces on the chessboard in this great storm. We must keep our heads down and wait quietly."
Senior Brother Tang sighed. He took another sip of tea and shook his head. "It is a pity Yu Yufeng cultivated the Jade Court General and conflicted with that sword immortal. If this person had not died, he could still be of some use."
"He brought it upon himself!"
Yu Muxian's expression finally changed, showing some resentment as he said, "Daoist Master Shangyuan wanted to claim the Jade True Unified Void Essence. As soon as I heard the news after joining the sect, I specifically informed him. He still clung to luck, secretly conducting some blood sacrifice in the Yu Family! In the end, the truth came out. If I had not cleared myself quickly, I would have been dragged down by him!"
"After all, it is a matter of obstructing the Dao," Senior Brother Tang said as he sighed deeply.
Li Yuanjiao and the others kneeled quietly before the stone door of the cave dwelling. After a moment, a broad-shouldered man with a stern expression, carrying a sword on his back and appearing to be around sixty years old, stepped out of the cave. All the younger members of the Li Family immediately greeted him respectfully.
"Greetings, Ancestor!"
"Hmm," Li Tongya responded, holding two small letters in his hand. He glanced at Li Yuanjiao, who was kneeling below, and said warmly, "Not bad, you have already reached the fourth heavenly layer of Qi Cultivation Realm."
Li Yuanjiao had always been gifted. Since receiving the talisman, he continuously accumulated power within his body which increased with every passing moment. While Li Qinghong was still in seclusion trying to break through the third heavenly layer, he had naturally broken through to the fourth. He bowed his head slightly and replied respectfully, "All thanks to the power of the talisman qi."
Li Tongya sat down at the jade table inside the cave dwelling and took out two small letters from his sleeve. One of them was written by Li Yuanjiao, concerning Yu Muxian, which both of them were aware of and therefore skipped. The other letter came from Cloud Crowned Peak.
"Reporting to Second Uncle, Brother Ling has gone north for three months and has not returned. His jade talisman remains bright and intact."
"Uncle Xuanling… has gone missing?!" Li Yuanjiao cried out in concern.
Li Tongya nodded slowly, his face showing no surprise. He simply stared at Li Yuanjiao, asking in a low voice, "Indeed. What do you think?"
Li Yuanjiao hesitated slightly, pondering in his heart. He bit his lip and said solemnly, "Uncle Xuanling is missing, his safety unknown. I should not say this, but to speak honestly… there is likely a scheme involved!"
"Oh?" Li Tongya nodded, seemingly unaffected by his son's disappearance, and asked steadily, "Why do you think so?"
Li Yuanjiao cupped his fist and replied, "Uncle Xuanling has always been steady and reliable. It is unlike him to be gone for months without any news… If there has been no news for this long, yet the jade talisman remains undimmed and unbroken, it must be that he is intentionally being held. The intent is likely not about him but to lure the tiger away from the mountain or draw the snake out of its hole… It is either aimed at you, ancestor, or at Mount Lijing."
Li Tongya nodded approvingly and said gently, "If I continue to stay on this mountain and do not go north, within a few months, someone will bring a letter from Xuanling seeking rescue, forcing me to go there anyway."
Li Yuanjiao said hesitantly, "What if ancestor still refuses to go?"
"Then they will send his head."
Li Tongya shook his head and smiled. "The prominent figures have coveted my fate for many years. I have fought with them repeatedly, and now we are at the final move. If I comply, it will mean the deaths of both my son and myself. If I refuse, fearing death, it will be far more than just our deaths."
"So, it is the prominent figures of the Purple Mansion Realm or Maha…" Li Yuanjiao murmured, perplexed and frustrated.
"I just do not understand why they are after you, Ancestor."
"At first, I didn't understand either. I thought some member of the Purple Mansion Realm wanted to use my immortal foundation." Li Tongya chuckled and, staring into Li Yuanjiao's eyes, said seriously, "Later, when Murong Xia came and Minghui intervened to stop me, they hinted at the truth. After inquiring from multiple sources, I finally understood. The one who wants my life is not someone of the Purple Mansion Realm… but a Maha."
Li Yuanjiao frowned deeply, unable to hide his pain. Running his thumb along the Dragon Coiling Pillar sword at his waist, he asked in a low voice, "B-But… the Maha does not need an immortal foundation. What good does it do him to harm you, ancestor?"
Li Tongya took off the Qingche Sword, unwrapping the layers of cloth covering it. With a flick of his finger, the long sword extended a cun, its translucent green-white blade gleaming brightly, illuminating his eyes. His eyebrows arched, and his originally calm demeanor transformed, revealing a sinister, serpent dragon-like aura.
Gently gazing at the immortal sword of peak Foundation Establishment Realm, Li Tongya said, "Immortal cultivators consume qi, while Buddhist cultivators devour life. The Maha covets my Deep Ocean Whale Dragon Fate."
