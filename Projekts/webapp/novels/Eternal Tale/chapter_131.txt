Chen Xun was truly impressed this time, returning the booklet to the big black ox, who then let him go.
It kept grunting in its mouth, muttering angrily, looking at Chen Xun with quite an unfriendly gaze. Chen Xun had never taken anything from it before.
The big black ox sat against the cave wall, sulking, while Chen Xun continued to ponder the increase in his internal spiritual energy.
He furrowed his brows slightly, raising one hand as five colorful streams of spiritual energy surrounded him. "This spiritual energy feels so heavy, but it's only the first stage."
He interpreted the "Jade Spirit Scripture" as consisting of numerous stages corresponding to his various levels of cultivation. Now, he had completed the condensation of the Qi Refining Stage.
The spiritual energy in his body was gradually becoming stronger, not relying on the use of spells or spiritual energy enhancement.
Previously, the original strength of the spiritual energy in his body was 1, but now it is 2. With the addition of spells and spiritual energy enhancement, heh...
A smile appeared on Chen Xun's lips as he gazed at the towering mountains in the distance, as if they were all under his feet.
The world is vast, and one can go anywhere. If you are unable to, just run. If faced with a calamity of heaven and earth, if you can't escape, just endure it. After living for over a hundred years, every day is a bonus.
"Old ox."
"Moo?"
"Come over and practice cultivation. Hurry up, I'll explain the technique to you!"
"Moo~"
The big black ox instantly stopped sulking, quickly ran over, and even rubbed against Chen Xun.
Chen Xun began to explain, word by word, quite experiencedly. The big black ox sat beside him, nodding continuously, seeming to understand.
After half a day of explanation, the ox also began to meditate and cultivate outside, not daring to seclude itself in the cave for fear of collapsing.
Chen Xun stood by the river, his consciousness always focused on the big black ox. He took out the Northern Cold Radiance Furnace from his storage bag.
He squinted his eyes; this was quite an expensive purchase, the most expensive thing he had ever bought in his life.
Chen Xun began to carefully observe it. Under the sunlight, the icy blue furnace body was interspersed with purple, with countless unique patterns flashing by.
The furnace looked quite ancient but also exuded a beauty marred by the passage of time. It was quite damaged inside, with many mottled traces.
However, Chen Xun couldn't yet discern the material used to forge this furnace. He estimated that even if he disassembled it, he could still make a considerable profit.
He probed into it with his consciousness, inspecting it inch by inch, wiping away even the slightest residue. It had to be spotless.
There are many means in the cultivation world, such as seizing bodies, and attaching one's soul to an object. One must be careful.
The old man hadn't lied; this furnace's material was indeed well-suited for his consciousness, giving him a sense of acceleration without any blockage.
"Perfect, this furnace suits me well. Chen Xun began to stroke the furnace body, finding no issues. "If you're really good, I might as well turn you into a nurturing item for the Golden Core."
He chuckled, there were still vacant spots among the five Golden Cores, which was quite audacious.
If those Golden Core cultivators saw him behaving like this, he would probably become the enemy of the entire cultivation world.
"Go."
Chen Xun waved his hand, and the North Cold Radiance Furnace spiraled up into the sky, silently floating on the water surface as he immediately sat down.
Several Foundation Establishment stage spiritual herbs instantly entered the furnace, Chen Xun's finger movements were fragrant, and the fire in his body quietly emerged.
It was a vibrant flame, but without any warmth, appearing quite ordinary.
But the stream was greatly astonished! It was actually scared enough by this flame to part a waterway, seemingly unwilling to provoke it.
"This furnace... is indeed much better than a Yellow-grade alchemy furnace."
Chen Xun was quite satisfied; the power of the fire was also continuously deepening, and the liquid of each spiritual herb was rapidly refined.
Just then, the North Cold Radiance Furnace underwent a startling change, seemingly influenced by the abundance of qi; it sang out, and its color changed to purple.
The medicinal power inside the furnace did not dissipate at all; it was tightly condensed within, waiting only to form pills.
Chen Xun's pupils widened, his mouth slightly agape. After hundreds of years of alchemy, was this situation even possible?!
Previously, it was always due to insufficient fire control, consciousness, or technique, resulting in the inability to condense the medicine, ultimately turning into a pile of waste liquid.
But now, it was forcefully condensed. This furnace... was extraordinary.
"Could it be the power of my Five Elements Golden Core? Or perhaps the enhancement of spiritual energy after advancing in rank? Causing the fire to undergo a mutation again?"
Chen Xun fell into contemplation. He heard that this item had a long heritage. Could it be used by ancient alchemists with five-element spiritual roots?
"Heh heh, how could that be possible, it's all damn damaged."
Chen Xun quickly shook his head. How could such a good thing fall into their laps? They hadn't even encountered countless cliffs and caves.
However, there was still a hint of joy in his eyes. Living long enough might really change their luck. This possibility wasn't impossible.
On the other side, the big black ox had now returned to its original state, with its horns extremely sharp and hard and its dense fur adding a majestic aura to it.
Five chains of spiritual energy still surrounded the ox's body, exactly like the phenomenon when Chen Xun was cultivating.
Watching this, Chen Xun felt a bit envious. It felt so secure. He wondered how many female oxen it would charm if it ran into the herd.
By the stream, in addition to the alchemy furnace, there were also incense altars filled with crude wooden carvings made from crane spirit trees.
Surrounding spiritual energy surged, and green smoke rose. The altar-opening ceremony began!
"I'm opening the furnace for alchemy. I hope the gods and Buddhas bless me, give Chen Xun some face, and ensure prosperity in the future."
Chen Xun showed extreme piety and then took out various spiritual herbs for the Five Elements Pill, officially starting the alchemy process while still observing the big black ox.
The North Cold Radiance Furnace spiraled up into the sky, and one spiritual herb after another was thrown into it, emitting a fragrant aroma.
"This year, I missed a grand auction due to some business. Fellow cultivators, until the next century!"
Chen Xun issued another low shout, continuously exerting his spiritual energy, his consciousness wandering inside the alchemy furnace, and the pill fire became finer, far surpassing before.
...
Cultivation knows no age, and neither does alchemy.
The centennial event of Yuxu City finally came to an end, with countless sect cultivators leaving the city.
Many cultivators also ventured together into mysterious realms. Nowadays, West City remains bustling, and the upper echelons of the cultivation world seem to be collaborating on something big.
It seemed that the rapid expansion of strength and ambition had made these big shots restless, but it was unclear whether they were directed outward or inward.
Outside the city, giant ships roared, and countless flying spirit beasts soared in the sky.
Inside the city, countless cultivators from various countries remained. Yuxu City had returned to its usual calm, albeit with a bit more hustle and bustle.
Inside Qin Immortal Mountain, some cultivators passed away, some bought caves, and some left when their cave leases expired.
Although time moved a bit slower for cultivators, it still depicted the various states of life in the cultivation world.
Time is ruthless, but it still missed two bandits in the river of time, Chen Xun, and the big black ox!
"Ah, eternal life is good~~ it's wonderful~~"
"Moo moo~"
By the stream, Chen Xun and the big black ox sang their own adapted version of the "Eternal Life Song."
The big black ox had successfully cultivated a month earlier than Chen Xun, significantly faster. After all, it had no distracting thoughts and had also been taught many experiences.
Chen Xun also finished the alchemy, and the pill success rate increased by thirty percent. It really was an issue with the alchemy furnace!
They relaxed for another day, sitting by the stream, singing songs, watching the sunrise and sunset, imagining the future, combining work and rest, and achieving mental clarity.
