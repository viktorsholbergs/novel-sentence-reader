Li Xuanfeng bid farewell to Liu Changdie and left some money behind for Jiang Yunu, then rode the wind southward along the Guli Road for a few hours. The faint golden light dome enveloped in misty clouds of Mount Lijing appeared before him.
Landing on the mountaintop, he was greeted by the cheerful Li Xuanxuan.
Seeing Li Xuanxuan's contagious smile, Li Xuanfeng could not help but smile as well.
"Brother Xuan, what's making you so happy?" he asked with a grin.
"Second Uncle has acquired a treasure sword containing a footwork legacy from Lingyu Gate called the River Crossing Torrential Step, it's a Grade Three technique! Naturally, that's a cause for joy!" Li Xuanxuan replied with almost a chirp in his tone.
He handed over a jade slip before continuing, "Everyone at home has read and memorized it; Second Uncle has already entered seclusion to practice it… You should read it quickly!"
Li Xuanfeng laughed as he took the jade slip, scanned it briefly with his spiritual sense, and nodded seriously.
"Great timing! It's Lu and An families' turn to guard the mine vein, and there are no affairs at home that need attention… I'm also planning to enter seclusion to make a breakthrough. I'll take this jade slip with me and leave the home matters to you, brother."
Li Xuanxuan nodded in agreement, waving his hand dismissively to assure him.
"That's good news! You go ahead and focus on your seclusion."
With Li Xuanxuan and Chen Donghe both already having condensed the Jade Capital Chakra and attained the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, the family's safety should not be an issue for concern at all.
Li Xuanfeng nodded before pocketing the jade slip, then flew toward Meiche Peak to begin his cultivation in seclusion.
Li Xuanxuan descended the mountain only to be approached hastily by Li Xuanling, appearing to have an eager announcement to make.
"Brother Xuan! People from the Yu Family have arrived at the front yard, asking to see you."
"Not Qi Cultivators..?" Li Xuanxuan frowned.
Usually, when other families visited, Qi Cultivators would inquire from outside the formation; only messengers or disciples of the Embryonic Breathing Realm would send someone to formally announce their arrival.
"He's a Qi Cultivator who came down riding the wind. He specifically said not to disturb Clan Uncle Tongya, so I came up to report," Li Xuanling answered.
Li Xuanxuan nodded, puzzled. Nonetheless, he straightened his clothes and walked toward the courtyard. There, he spotted a middle-aged man in a long robe sitting on a chair, fidgeting with the wooden armrest—clearly uneasy. His aura was formidable, indicating he was at least a mid-stage Qi Cultivator.
"Li Xuanxuan of the Li Family greets the elder," Li Xuanxuan greeted as he announced his presence, cupping his fist.
The middle-aged man returned the gesture right away and upon realizing the visitor was not Li Tongya, looked visibly relieved. He carried a sword on his back and looked rather stiff. He then introduced himself politely.
"Yu Family's Yu Mujian."
Yu Mujian lost face in the spar on the boat and got severely reprimanded by Yu Xiaogui upon returning home. Coinciding with the Yu Family's market opening, Yu
Xiaogui sent him to apologize to Li Tongya and also to extend an invitation to the Li Family to attend the opening ceremony.
All the way, Yu Mujian felt aggrieved, fearing that Li Tongya would think he had come to reclaim the sword.
Heaven pity him! All this talk of "Sharp Qi" and "control it at his will" left Yu Mujian utterly confused.
He did not understand even a single word of his.
He thought he grasped the essence of swordsmanship, yet he failed to comprehend Li Tongya's words. Ashamed to meet Li Tongya, he chose to follow the process for Embryonic Breathing Realm cultivators when visiting the Li Family.
Upon inquiring with Li Xuanling, he learned that Li Tongya was in seclusion and not receiving guests, which was a relief for him.
Even heaven couldn't bear to see me embarrassed further…
He could not help but blush sheepishly to himself at the thought.
However, when he met Li Xuanxuan and introduced themselves, Li Xuanxuan realized who he was and could not contain his surprise.
"So, you are Senior Mujian!"
His exclamation hit Yu Mujian like a bolt of lightning. Realizing he had made a complete fool of himself to the extent that even people across the lake had found out, he gulped and asked awkwardly, "You've heard of me?"
Seeing Yu Mujian's expression, Li Xuanxuan quickly changed the subject, smiling.
"Elder Tongya, my second uncle, told me that among the families around the lake, only Young Master Yu Mujian's swordsmanship can truly be called the way of the sword! The rest are merely hacking with swords."
Though the comment was meant as fickle flattery, the simple-minded Yu Mujian took it to heart, delighted. Recalling his provocations on the boat, he felt deep guilt, sighing as he looked up at the sky.
"Li Tongya is truly a gentleman! I am the lesser man."
Li Xuanxuan was stunned, unable to keep up with his train of thought. Yu Mujian sighed before handing over the invitation to Li Xuanxuan. "Once Senior Tongya emerges from seclusion, I must personally visit to apologize!" he said solemnly with a grim smile.
While still muttering words like "Sharp Qi" and " control it at his will", Yu Mujian disappeared into the distance, leaving Li Xuanxuan and Li Xuanling looking at each other in bewilderment.
"This person..." Li Xuanling was at a loss for words, and even Li Xuanxuan was somewhat puzzled as he opened the invitation card.
The Yu Family had already informed the families about the event on the boat but made a special effort to deliver a formal invitation to the Li Family, both as a gesture of respect and as an attempt at goodwill.
After reading the invitation, Li Xuanxuan made up his mind and instructed, "Brother Qiuyang is good in his way of handling things… Sending someone with his cultivation will not make the Li Family appear too ostentatious as well!"
Time flowed like a river, and over the past year, with not much happening at home, Li Xuanxuan diligently practiced while keeping an eye on the movements of various families. However, mastering the complex and profound 'River Crossing Torrential Step' from Lingyu Gate was not a feat that could be simply achieved in a day or two.
Lifting his brush, Li Xuanxuan drew a talisman on the paper in one fluid motion. Having practiced for about ten years now, his success rate in talisman drawing had finally become profitable, adding yet another source of income to the family.
The sunlight from the window bathed Li Yuanxiu in a golden glow. The boy, now four or five years old and having just returned from school, stood quietly in the sunlight, watching his father.
Li Xuanxuan looked up and caught his eyes.
"What's wrong?" he asked gently with a smile.
"Father, it's been a month since you last visited Jiao'er," Li Yuanxiu spoke. This comment startled Li Xuanxuan, who narrowed his eyes in suspicion.
"Who told you to say that?"
"Nobody," Li Yuanxiu replied as he pressed his lips tightly together, looking a bit afraid of Li Xuanxuan's serious demeanor but still meeting his gaze defiantly.
"Alright," Li Xuanxuan finally sighed as he nodded and picked up his son. He headed out, feeling rather emotional.
Li Xiangping had died in Mount Yue's territory. Although the Li Family was not aware of the details, they had suspected the involvement of Mu Jiaoman and Mount Wu but had to let it go in order to maintain peace and avoid Mount Wu's attention.
When Mu Yalu came to propose marriage, Li Tongya and Li Xuanxuan valued her ancient Mulu bloodline, planning it as a chess piece for future control over Mount Yue—to avoid trouble when great changes occur in the mountains.
However, since Mu Yalu is Mu Jiaoman's clan sister, Li Xuanxuan— despite not saying it aloud, could not help his feelings of resentment. This affected his feelings toward Li Yuanjiao.
Hearing his son's words now, he began to ponder his actions.
For the sake of the family's stability in the next hundred years… I must not show favoritism.
As they approached the courtyard, Li Xuanxuan set Li Yuanxiu down gently, who cheerfully ran away to find his younger brother, Yuanjiao.
Soon, Mu Yalu's joyful voice was heard from a distance.
"Xiu'er, you're here! Come sit!"
Li Xuanxuan laughed and entered the courtyard to see Mu Yalu, who was startled to see him. She paused for a moment before quickly regaining her composure and bowed politely.
"The family head has arrived."
Li Yuanjiao, holding a wooden toy, looked up and called out, "Father!"
"Mm," Li Xuanxuan nodded at Mu Yalu and sat aside, watching the children play. The sunlight at the foot of the mountain was even brighter now, making Li Yuanjiao's eyes appear a brownish hue as he smiled toward Li Xuanxuan.
"Jiao'er, come here," Li Xuanxuan's voice trembled slightly. Mu Yalu, sensing something was off, looked up worriedly.
When Li Yuanjiao walked over, puzzled. Li Xuanxuan examined his face but found no trace of brown in the shadows.
Sighing, Li Xuanxuan stood up, his gaze wandering. "I have matters to attend to on the mountain. I must leave now," he said solemnly.
With that, he left, leaving Li Yuanjiao and Li Yuanxiu playing in the courtyard. Mu Yalu watched him go, sitting quietly in the corner.
