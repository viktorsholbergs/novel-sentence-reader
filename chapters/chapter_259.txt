An Zheyan, having completed his meditation, slowly got down from the rock atop the mountain. Before him sat a middle-aged man with a head full of gray hair, appearing at least ten years older than An Zheyan.
The man was meditating silently, but as An Zheyan approached, he opened his eyes and greeted, "Senior."
An Zheyan merely nodded, his expression somewhat downcast. The middle-aged man raised an eyebrow, and his once stern face softened with a hint of a smile as he asked, "Could it be that you were driven out by your wife again?"
An Zheyan shook his head and sighed, replying with a mix of amusement and exasperation, "It is not something to laugh about, Brother Youdao! My wife, Feiruo, is perfect in every way, except for her domineering personality..."
Tian Youdao chuckled softly. He had a certain fondness for this former head of the An Family but kept his distance due to the presence of many prying eyes. He simply responded, "Feiruo is both capable and ambitious."
The Li Family had attempted to arrange a marriage for An Zheyan in the town several times. Many children with spiritual orifices were already betrothed; even Li Yuanyun almost could not marry one.
It was even more challenging for someone like An Zheyan, once infamous for his brutality, to find a match. Eventually, he ended up marrying Li Feiruo.
Li Feiruo had previously married westward to Mount Yue, accomplished feats there, and also managed Lichuankou Village. She was not only beautiful but also carried an aura of nobility.
An Zheyan, despite being a Qi Cultivator, had been through many ups and downs, which had softened his temperament. Li Feiruo completely dominated him, but despite his complaints, their life together was fairly harmonious.
An Zheyan chuckled, avoiding the topic. "I see that Brother Tian is troubled… What worries you?" he asked politely.
Tian Youdao sighed deeply, his old face drooping as he replied, "At over fifty years old, I have enjoyed what pleasures I could and barely reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm before sixty. What troubles could I have... except for the fact that my children and grandchildren are disappointing."
Such a topic of conversation made An Zheyan's slightly uneasy. He said softly, "Brother Youdao need not worry… Sometimes, there is a blessing in ignorance. Having children and grandchildren that are too outstanding might not always be a good thing…"
Tian Youdao remained silent. The two sat on the peak when a figure climbed up, dressed in a long robe with a sword at his waist and a composed expression—it was Chen Donghe.
Chen Donghe appeared travel-worn, indicating that he had just returned from somewhere. The two men stood and cupped their fists in greeting. Chen Donghe returned the salute, and An Zheyan laughed, "Donghe, where have you been?"
Chen Donghe shook off the dust from his robe, and then stood proudly, now clean and neat. He answered softly, "My wife and daughter are in Lijing Town… I always miss them and have to go back to see them."
Chen Donghe sat by the stone table and took a sip from a jade cup. Looking puzzled, he asked, "Upon my return, I heard that Tian Zhongqing volunteered to lead a group of Tian Family members to Eastern Mount Yue and accepted a quota of six hundred jin of Spirit Paddies. Uncle, what is the meaning of this?"
Tian Youdao simply shook his head, muttering, "It's a long story… the children are just disappointing."
Chen Donghe saw that Tian Youdao was reluctant to elaborate and paused before speaking gently, "Allow me to say something. The high-born children are indeed arrogant; perhaps this ordeal is a good thing for them..."
Tian Youdao raised his eyebrows, indicating for Chen Donghe to continue. Chen Donghe nodded and continued in a low voice, "Every day I see the children of the Tian Family in the town cockfighting, racing dogs, and acting arrogantly. I was always secretly worried for you, Uncle! Although today's incident caused a setback for the Tian Family, it might have helped avert a greater disaster in the future; it is truly a fortunate event!"
These comforting words eased Tian Youdao's mind considerably, but he still frowned and sighed. "You are right, Donghe. Zhongqing is still decent enough, so I can rest assured about him… But those useless ones like Tian Rong, they can always stir up trouble!"
Tian Youdao then waved his sleeve and stood up, seeming to have made a decision. He then said in a deep voice, "I shall now enter seclusion for a breakthrough, no more preparations are necessary. Lingering on this mountain always leaves me uneasy. The sooner I break through and descend, the better I can oversee them!"
After saying this, he cupped his fists to Chen Donghe and An Zheyan and turned to head toward the spirit spring cave dwelling. As the stone door closed heavily, Chen Donghe set down his jade cup and looked at An Zheyan, who sat there dumbfounded. He chuckled lightly as he spoke warmly to the man.
"Feel free to resume your cultivation."
Yu Yufeng flew on the wind for a while. The speed of a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator was swift, and almost in an instant, he had left the territory of the Yu Family, passed over the long and flat An Family's lands, and flew past the Li Family's territory.
Below, the smoke from cooking fires rose slowly, and the crowing of roosters and barking of dogs made the early morning scene particularly lively.
Yu Yufeng felt greatly moved as he calculated, quietly formulating a plan. He muttered slowly, "The Li Family's method of rearing mortals is truly excellent! The land around Mount Dali is not particularly fertile, yet they manage to support so many mortals. If I used them for my consumption, it would not just heal the wounds on my hands, but it might even help me advance further!"
Yu Yufeng's heart was filled with agitation, but he knew better than to act recklessly. He gritted his teeth and said harshly, "If it were not for that sword immortal's protection, how could such delicacies slip away from me? For now, I should seize this opportunity... Once I break through to the Purple Mansion Realm, I will immediately join the Azure Pond Sect. Who cares about a mere one or two hundred thousand mortals?"
With these thoughts, Yu Yufeng felt a surge of joy within him, quickening his pace as he swiftly flew over the Li Family's territory, heading west along the Guli Road. The mystical guidance in his heart became increasingly clear.
Yu Yufeng was greatly excited, and as his mana increased, the sword scars carved on his palms began to ache faintly, almost making him howl in pain.
Unaware of his abnormal reaction, Yu Yufeng descended upon the small hill. Suddenly, a buzzing noise exploded in his ears as beams of light shot up instantly, enveloping the sky in a pristine barrier.
Yu Yufeng's mind went blank as he shouted out angrily, "Who dares block my way?! Who dares steal my opportunity?!"
"Hah!" A cold laugh echoed from above him, a thunderous voice ringing in Yu Yufeng's ears.
"Your death is imminent, and yet you are unaware that you've been ensnared… Yu Yufeng, you are truly worthless!"
These words exploded like thunder in Yu Yufeng's ears, clearing his muddled eyes instantly. He felt as though he had just woken up from a long dream. Shivering coldly, the events of the past half-day flooded his mind.
Yu Yufeng murmured, a hint of anxiety creeping into his voice, "I am the ancestor of the Yu Family, connected with Yuanwu Peak. Yu Muxian from my clan is cultivating there, and he's grand disciple of a Daoist Master! You better consider your next actions carefully!"
However, no one in the formation responded. Three figures slowly rose, and Yu Yufeng, startled, quickly scanned them with his spiritual sense. Terror engulfed him completely. He stepped back, realizing that the formation had enclosed him entirely.
Finally, realizing the magnitude of his foolish actions, he muttered, "Spell…? No, divine ability…! Which Purple Mansion Realm cultivator seeks my life?"
