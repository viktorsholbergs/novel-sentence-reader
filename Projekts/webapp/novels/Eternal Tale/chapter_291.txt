"Then it seems we won't be able to roam the city together anymore, Brother Chen."
Yu Jingxin's once-distracted pupils slowly regained focus, his warm smile still intact. "I never expected us to be enemies. Truly, fate toys with people."
Chen Xun took a slow sip of his health tea, his gaze growing colder by the second.
Despite this, neither man exuded any visible tension nor killing intent.
"I never would have guessed, Brother Yu, that you were such a greedy person. It seems my eyes deceived me," Chen Xun remarked coldly, devoid of emotion. "After cultivating immortality for so many years, this is the first time I've misjudged someone. Heh, people are not what they used to be."
Yu Jingxin remained silent, raising his cup and downing it in one gulp. The real Yu Jingxin was long dead, and he was no longer who he used to be.
"This place is the Yu family stronghold. You cannot escape, even if you are a Nascent Soul cultivator."
He rose slowly, his expression solemn, hands clasped behind his back as he turned away from Chen Xun. At that moment—
Boom!
A thunderous roar erupted as a grand formation activated around them. An overwhelming and unyielding pressure burst forth like a mountain torrent, its killing intent surging skyward. It was a trap year in the making.
Chen Xun suddenly felt a tremendous oppressive force piercing his soul. However, as his cultivation was not rooted in spiritual energy, the formation's effects were negligible.
In the distance, two figures' gazes sharpened, their eyes gleaming like tangible entities. They controlled the formation from the shadows, with the intent of trapping Chen Xun.
Yu Jingxin's palm glowed with light, forming a mysterious symbol in the air before him. As soon as it appeared, waves of oppressive energy emanated from it, enveloping the surroundings.
"Brother Chen, surrender. I won’t kill you. This formation has been prepared for you for many years."
"But I will kill you."
Chen Xun's icy voice rang out, his entire body surging with lightning, entirely unaffected by the formation.
In an instant, an unimaginably powerful aura erupted from him, tangible and overwhelming.
The two late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators controlling the formation felt their hearts tremble violently. Their faces turned pale as paper.
This aura was too strong. Even with Yu Jingxin's cultivation, he had only just perceived its intensity.
Yu Jingxin's mind reeled. He had been unable to see through Chen Xun's cultivation back in the mountains, and it clearly wasn’t due to the influence of that black artifact from the forbidden seas years ago!
And the overwhelming pressure behind him—it was an aura, the likes of which he had never encountered. Just a fleeting glance left him consumed by terror.
Yu Jingxin's brows furrowed deeply as he spun around abruptly. "Chen Xun, who are you really?!"
"The one who will kill you."
Chen Xun's expression remained cold and detached as he spoke. Three formation flags appeared in his hand, instantly creating an intricate formation that enveloped the pavilion. The speed was blinding, executed in the blink of an eye.
Yu Jingxin was utterly shocked. Was this teleportation formation?
But how could a teleportation formation be constructed as easily as an ordinary array? And with flags, no less! This man was the renowned formation master from that massive ancient ship!
In a flash, Yu Jingxin pieced everything together—Chen Xun intended to escape!
"Big Brother! Second Brother!"
Yu Jingxin's booming voice echoed across the heavens, shaking the very earth. This man was beyond his ability to suppress and had exceeded all his expectations.
All this transpired in mere moments.
Yu Jingxin was shaken to his core. A colossal spiritual pressure blanketed the heavens and the earth, even causing the carefully prepared killing array to waver and tremble!
"An ancient spiritual pressure?! Chen Xun, are you a descendant of the ancient clans?!"
Yu Jingxin's eyes widened in disbelief as if recalling some horrifying truth. He involuntarily roared, "Impossible!"
Golden streaks of light flickered across his body, and a massive vortex materialized on the ground beneath him. This vortex brimmed with the endless power of the five elements.
"Teleport!"
Chen Xun raised two fingers together, his gaze cold and abyssal as he locked eyes with Yu Jingxin, as though pulling him into an endless void.
"What is this?!" Yu Jingxin's eyes snapped toward Chen Xun. His entire body froze in place, unable to move an inch.
Yet his heart pounded violently, as if on the verge of bursting. His spiritual energy, primordial spirit, and divine sense were simultaneously suppressed!
In an instant, both Chen Xun and Yu Jingxin vanished from the spot, leaving the small pavilion shattered into fragments. The speed was so incredible that no one had time to react.
"Ancestor!"
"Ancestor!!"
Two agonized cries rang out from the distance. What kind of formation could forcibly suppress teleportation?!
Boom!
With a deafening rumble, the peak of the mountain erupted with turbulent winds and roiling clouds. Two transcendent figures appeared atop the mountain, their treasures hovering at their sides. Their expressions were grave as they stood, seemingly awaiting something.
"This isn't good. The speed was too fast. Third Brother is in grave danger."
"The direction of the Forbidden Sea—it's them!"
The two Yu family ancestors exchanged glances, their overwhelming auras surging outward. In a flash, they turned into streaks of light and vanished into the horizon, racing toward the Forbidden Sea.
Their faces betrayed a trace of unease. To forcibly teleport and escape—it defied the conventions of the cultivation world.
Tonight was destined to be sleepless.
The entirety of the mountain seemed to awaken. Deafening commotion erupted as cultivators from all directions mobilized. Streams of vibrant magical light streaked through the sky amidst the chaos.
Not only that, but the entire Feiyun Prefecture was also alarmed. A Yu family Nascent Soul ancestor had been forcibly teleported!
"Who dares?! To target a Nascent Soul powerhouse?!"
"Forcible teleportation? That's impossible!"
"The three ancient cultivation clans have all been stirred tonight. A great upheaval is upon us—do not get involved."
...
News spread like wildfire. Cultivators in every city were abuzz with speculation. A battle involving Nascent Soul-level powers had surpassed their comprehension.
In the heavens above, beams of light from teleportation formations shot skyward. Numerous Yu family disciples mobilized to call for reinforcements. This was a Nascent Soul ancestor; the fall of one would shake the entire Great Li Realm!
...
Jiang Family Ancestral Grounds.
Two elders were struck with overwhelming shock. How could Yu Jingxin have failed? Who was that Forbidden Sea cultivator? And how could they achieve such an impossible forced teleportation?!
"Brother, something major has happened."
"The direction of the Forbidden Sea."
An elder with a head of snow-white hair spoke in a low tone as he performed a divination. His eyes trembled as he said, "A dire calamity. We must act."
Buzz!
A surge of boundless energy erupted from the Jiang ancestral grounds as two beams of white light shot into the sky. The clouds in the heavens scattered under the immense power.
On the ground below, the Jiang family members looked in shock. Both ancestors had taken action—an event of this magnitude was unprecedented.
The Yao family also received the news.
A graceful woman with an elegant demeanor emerged from seclusion, her bright, intelligent eyes shimmering like water. She treads the skies, rapidly heading toward the Forbidden Sea.
Meanwhile, the Two Sacred Palaces remained embroiled in their standoff with the Great Li’s Buddhism, declaring their inability to intervene in the matter.
The five great ancient sects each had ancestors emerge from seclusion. Whoever dared to target the Yu family's Nascent Soul ancestor had to be a formidable figure. They were also deeply intrigued by the formation capable of forcibly teleporting a Nascent Soul powerhouse.
Throughout the Great Li Realm, undercurrents surged as one great power after another streaked across the night sky. They left faint afterimages under the moonlight, their auras imposing and unstoppable.
Ordinary cultivators watched in awe and fear, realizing that something monumental had shaken the highest echelons of the Great Li Realm’s power structure.
