Li Tongya rode the winds westward, crossing the Big Fish Creek that marked the boundary between Eastern Mount Yue and the Li Family's territory. He flew over Shamoli's palaces, venturing deeper into Mount Yue territory.
As he journeyed west, the jungle thickened. The villages appeared more desolate and dilapidated now, their dirt roads strewn with abandoned skeletons.
The living—emaciated to the point where their skin was tightly stretched over bones—crawled on the ground, boiling the white bones in broken pots to make a grayish soup. They were surrounded by howling and hungry jackals, waiting for the people to fall.
Li Tongya observed silently as he flew over the vibrant Lijing Town, the nicely renovated homes of thousands of households in Eastern Mount Yue, then to the lands of Mount Yue where bones littered the ground and where beasts devoured humans.
He glanced briefly at the skeletal, emaciated people who looked up as he passed, then continued westward on the wind.
Several dozen li westward, where human settlements became slightly more frequent but equally dilapidated, he finally caught sight of a dark mountain with what seemed like a temple built atop it.
Li Tongya landed before the mountain, noticing many blackened heads impaled on stakes. As soon as his feet touched the ground, the eyes of the mounted heads snapped open, and those that still had their mouths intact began wailing.
"Living people! Living people!"
Li Tongya waited quietly until a man in simple robes, his hair disheveled and eyes pale, approached. The man, a Qi Cultivator at the sixth heavenly layer, squinted at Li Tongya. Then, with relative politeness, he cupped his fist and greeted him before saying, "Please follow me up the mountain."
Li Tongya shook his head, smiling, "Your master's curse is truly bizarre… I dare not ascend. Please have him come down."
The man with pale gray eyes removed a head from a stake with a grin before heading up the mountain. The remaining heads closed their eyes, dead once more.
After a few moments, a figure dressed in elaborate clothes with a storage pouch tied at his waist descended from the mountain. He wore the attire of a cultivator but bore the features of a Mount Yue native, and he was holding a dark gourd.
Glancing at Li Tongya, he exclaimed in surprise, "Li Tongya? You have achieved the Foundation Establishment Realm?!"
"Greetings to you, Senior Fei Luoya!" Li Tongya greeted as he recognized the man in front of him.
This person was indeed the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator from Mount Yue who, years ago during the division of Mount Wu, had been compelled by the Xiao Family to cede parts of Eastern Mount Yue to the Li Family.
Upon seeing Li Tongya's successful advancement to the Foundation Establishment Realm, Fei Luoya became significantly more polite.
"I expected no less of a sword immortal clan. To establish your foundation in just a few years is indeed enviable."
While he spoke courteously, it was evident that Fei Luoya was still preoccupied with the old grievances between their families, his expression somewhat strained. However, given Li Tongya's background and newfound strength, he dared not show open displeasure but instead forced a smile.
"You flatter me, Senior," Li Tongya said as he cupped his fist, adding, "It has been many years… I deeply regret any offenses from the past, and I am grateful that you bear no grudges, for which the Li Family is thankful."
"Haha." Fei Luoya laughed dryly. Li Tongya continued with a few more pleasantries, easing the atmosphere significantly, making Fei Luoya continue politely, "So… What brings Brother Tongya here?"
Li Tongya nodded and replied, "Living next to each other, our families should have had a better relationship… However, we have not interacted due to long-standing issues, and I deeply regret this. Senior's capabilities are formidable, and I, Li Tongya, hold deep respect for you and wish to ease the tensions between us."
"Oh, you're flattering me," Fei Luoya replied as he raised an eyebrow, his expression having improved significantly.
Li Tongya then continued, "I have a good friend who needs a spirit herb to collect its properties… Despite offering a hefty reward, I have yet to find the desired item. Considering the spiritual richness within the Mount Yue territory, Senior, you must possess many such precious spirit herbs, which could earn you a handsome profit."
Fei Luoya laughed heartily, believing that he understood Li Tongya's intent. "I see Brother Tongya is eyeing that substantial reward, planning to mediate and take a cut for yourself."
Li Tongya smiled faintly and nodded in response. "Senior is insightful. Indeed, it is a way for us both to make money. With the abundance of precious spirit herbs in Mount Dali and Mushroom Forest Plain, I sought out the Senior rather than others… Is this not also a gesture of goodwill?"
Upon reflection, Fei Luoya found Li Tongya's words rather sensible. He indeed had several precious spirit herbs lying around, unused.
Li Tongya then added, "This is a long-term deal, not just an affair of a day or two. If Senior wishes to mend ties with my family and earn this money, then let us collaborate."
Fei Luoya laughed loudly and replied, "Since Brother Tongya has put it this way, where is there any reason for me to refuse?"
Li Tongya, having previously forced Fei Luoya back, had already noticed that this man spent his days cultivating in Mount Wu, not mingling with the secular world. He was someone fierce on the outside but tender-hearted, and having been frightened by the joint efforts of the Xiao and Fei families, he was actually terrified of Li Tongya.
From creating something out of nothing, inverting right and wrong, Li Tongya had turned a situation where he had no choice but to ask for help into a mutually beneficial, relationship-smoothing opportunity.
He thought to himself, This man is skilled in curses and is a Mount Yue native; he probably doesn't even know the prices of most spirit herbs. However, he is a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator, and it wouldn't be right to deceive him. Spirit herbs are priceless; purchasing them at market price and planning for the future to use as favors or for disciples to consume is indeed a good strategy!
Acting briskly, Fei Luoya pulled out five or six wooden boxes and displayed them for Li Tongya to see. Li Tongya picked one up to examine closely. Each exuded a strong aura and sparkled colorfully.
Upon closer inspection, he recognized none of them but remained composed, using a spell to carefully examine the smallest fruit.
Fei Luoya was momentarily embarrassed and whispered, "I am afraid to say this for fear of being laughed at, but brother… I do not know what this is either. Thus, I have never used it and have stored it here for many years. The medicinal power is about to dissipate. If Brother Tongya had not come, I would have no trustworthy acquaintances in this area to turn to. You're truly solving my urgent dilemma!"
Li Tongya cupped his fist and said with a smile, "Since brother is being so honest, I will not mince words. The fruit matches the specifications required by my friend, and although the size is a bit small, it will just about do."
Fei Luoya nodded before gritting his teeth. "Brother Tongya… do you think this fruit is worth a hundred Spirit Stones?" he asked rather awkwardly.
"A hundred Spirit Stones?!"
Li Tongya let out a laugh, and although he didn't know much about it, he was aware that spirit herbs couldn't be bought for merely a hundred Spirit Stones.
He replied in a straightforward manner, "I will give you two hundred Spirit Stones for now. I will take this item, and if I find out its price, I will return for the excess or compensate for the shortfall and bring it to you!"
"Two hundred Spirit Stones?!" Fei Luoya was instantly shocked.
Li Tongya's honest way of speaking gave him a new perception of Li Tongya, earning much of his trust. Meanwhile, Li Tongya thought to himself with glee, As for when I'll find out the price, and when I'll return or compensate, that's all up to me to say. Fei Luoya is truly an honest man!
Fei Luoya nodded repeatedly as Li Tongya counted out two hundred Spirit Stones. Watching him joyfully accept them, Li Tongya then took out the jade box he had retrieved from the ruins of the Moongaze Lake market to store the brightly colored spirit fruit.
Fei Luoya glanced reluctantly at it, but then suddenly became startled, greatly alarmed. Far more knowledgeable about formations and curses than Li Tongya, he found himself transfixed by the intricate patterns on the jade box, continuously scrutinizing its exquisite details.
Li Tongya, ever so sharp, quickly thought of a witty response and casually said, "This jade box was a gift from that friend of mine so that I can collect the precious medicine!"
The more Fei Luoya looked, the more amazed he felt, murmuring, "This could easily hold treasures of the Purple Mansion Realm... This friend of yours..."
Li Tongya laughed heartily and replied, "He was introduced by the Sword Immortal, a Daoist Master of the Purple Mansion Realm!"
