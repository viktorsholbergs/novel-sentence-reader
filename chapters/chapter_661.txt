At Mount Qingdu.
Li Xijun stepped out of the hall, where a middle-aged man whose Daoist robe was embroidered with intricate patterns had been waiting.
Liu Changdie’s eyebrows rose as he appraised him and said softly, "Congratulations on reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm, nephew."
Li Xijun nodded and responded politely, "Greetings, uncle."
Liu Changdie examined the young man in white. Upon closer inspection, he felt that Li Xijun carried himself with the grace and calmness of falling snow. It was somewhat different from the youth in his memories.
He could not help but sigh inwardly, It seems the Dao of Frost and Snow truly suits the Eighth Young Master… Compared to the person I knew in my previous life, Li Xijun has shed some of that cynical coldness and instead gained a restrained sharpness that lies hidden beneath the snow. He may not have the reputation of his past self, but his temperament has grown.
A faint trace of delight flickered across Liu Changdie's face. When he thought about it, the only young master he had yet to meet was Li Ximing. He wondered what the young man looked like now. He estimated that Li Ximing should have reached the Foundation Establishment Realm as well.
While Liu Changdie was lost in thought, Li Xijun's gaze briefly swept over him.
Li Xijun thought, My family mentioned that this man might be carrying a thread of fate within him. Judging by his appearance, that seems to be true.
Liu Changdie was a rogue cultivator, yet he wore feathered robes. Li Xizhi was the only one in the Li Family who could afford similar attire, but that was only due to his marriage to the Yang Family’s Yang Xiao'er. It was clear from a single glance that Liu Changdie was no ordinary person.
Realizing his absentmindedness, Liu Changdie returned to his senses and smiled. "Young nephew, the grand formation has been fully set up. We are only waiting for the nobles to inspect it."
Li Xijun signaled him to proceed with a discreet gesture. As they walked, Liu Changdie continued with a grin, "This formation contains all five types of spirit water of the Water Virtue. It arranges these waters into formation points using ten formation platforms scattered across Mount Qingdu. Thus, the Five Waters can be controlled to block enemies. I call it the Heaven-Guarding Formation of Five Waters."
"As long as your esteemed clan activates this formation, it will tap into the water veins of this lake and Mount Qingdu to support its defenses. The formation will manifest five layers of water barriers that are capable of withstanding cultivators up to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment Realm."
Li Xijun and Liu Changdie rode the wind into the sky until they stood above the mountain’s peak. Liu Changdie took a small flag from his sleeve and gently waved it.
He turned to Li Xijun with a smile and said, "This formation is the culmination of my life's work! I dare say that every formation master at the Foundation Establishment Realm in Jiangnan would have to bow their heads before me. Even if Wan Huaqian clawed his way out of his grave to achieve the Foundation Establishment Realm, he might still be a step behind me!"
It was no wonder Li Changdie boasted so boldly. In Yue State, the name Wan Huaqian was often mentioned when it came to formation masters. He had created countless simplified formations that were now spread throughout Yue State. His reputation was only a little less widespread than Li Chejing in his prime.
However, Liu Changdie’s mention of Wan Huaqian sent a sudden thought sparking through Li Xijun’s mind. Where exactly did the Wan Family’s formation inheritance end up?
The Wan Family’s downfall had been personally recorded by Li Tongya. The Li Family had gotten their hands on the Ji Family’s legacy, yet nothing related to the Wan family’s formations had ever surfaced.
Perhaps Ji Dengqi delivered it to the Golden Tang Gate, thought Li Xijun.
But as he continued to conjecture, the spiritual energy over Mount Qingdu suddenly shifted. Ten streaks of cold light shot into the sky, weaving a brilliant blue barrier that descended from above.
Liu Changdie explained, "This is the first water manifestation: Pristine Water. It is called Morning Mist."
He gently formed a hand seal. A gray mist began to rise rapidly from the surface of the lake, cutting off any spiritual sense probing as it shrouded the area. The mist was as fine as silk as it crept upwards and began winding around Li Xijun’s robes.
A hint of surprise appeared on Li Xijun’s face. He lightly flicked his sleeve, dispersing the mist, but it crept back like a malignant parasite. He activated his perception technique, and everything became clear to him in an instant. It was clear that the mist had no real effect on him.
Li Xijun was not particularly surprised. His perception technique was enhanced by talisman qi, so it would have been stranger if he had failed to see through it.
Meanwhile, Liu Changdie continued, "As long as this first water manifestation stands, no number of Qi Cultivation cultivators would be able to break through!"
He formed another hand seal and softly uttered, "Serpent Stream."
The lake surrounding Mount Qingdu began to churn violently. Numerous agile water serpents rose from the lake. They twisted across the surface of the water with fierce and menacing expressions, weapons in hand.
Liu Changdie explained, "This is also meant to defend against Qi Cultivation cultivators. The water beasts summoned by the formation can hide within the mist and attack enemies while guarding the formation."
Liu Changdie proclaimed, "Pure Essence."
Another layer of water manifestation unfolded as a green-gray radiance shimmered over Liu Changdie’s body. It made him appear lighter, as though his entire body had become more agile. It was clearly a formation art meant to bolster his allies.
This particular layer was not especially impressive, since it lacked the striking impact of the first two water manifestations.
Liu Changdie seemed to understand this as well, so he did not dwell on it and swiftly changed his hand seals. "Grounded."
The wind beneath Li Xijun’s feet suddenly grew heavy. His footing suddenly grew unstable, and he was forced to channel his mana to steady himself. However, the sinking pressure was peculiar; it seemed to intensify with time, continuously draining his mana.
Liu Changdie’s face lit up with pride as he grinned. "It's all thanks to this rare spirit water from the Water Mansion system! This spirit water actually possesses some properties of Inferior Water, which is how I could enhance this anti-flight restriction to such a degree! Even Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators would need to think twice when facing this level of drain!"
Li Xijun’s eyebrows rose in surprise. Since this spell intensified with time, it was indeed different from ordinary anti-flight techniques.
He thought to himself, I heard sister-in-law provided this spirit water from the Water Mansion system… She didn’t say much, but this is clearly a rare treasure… It must be a high-grade spirit water from the Water Mansion system. It seems I owe her a favor…
Liu Changdie was in high spirits. Without pausing, his hand seals shifted again, summoning the final layer of water manifestation.
He laughed as he declared, "Layered Flow."
The surface of the lake surged violently. Waves rapidly rose and climbed up the mountain until it enveloped the entire brilliant blue formation, and by extension, Mount Qingdu in a thick layer of dark gray-black water. The water seemed steady and unyielding, giving off a sense of unwavering defense.
Li Xijun carefully observed every detail until Liu Changdie finally released his spell. The layers of water manifestations quickly dissipated, restoring the area to its original state.
Only then did Li Xijun let out a sigh as he said, "Uncle, my family hesitated and delayed, yet you bore no resentment. Instead, you poured even more effort into crafting this formation! How can I accept this without feeling ashamed?"
Li Xijun was well aware that what his family had provided was far from sufficient to construct such a formation. Liu Changdie must have quietly added a significant amount of his own resources. The sheer magnificence of this formation made it clear that it was no ordinary Foundation Establishment Realm formation.
He sighed inwardly, reached into his sleeve, and took out a storage pouch, intending to offer it as additional compensation.
However, Liu Changdie waved his hand firmly and said in a low voice, "I’ve been through many years of hardship. I’m not that fool from back then anymore! There are countless eyes watching me from the shadows… I know my limits! No matter what, don’t speak of favors. In the end, I won’t become a burden to your clan."
Li Xijun stiffened slightly.
Liu Changdie’s words rang true. After years of venturing and exploring, Liu Changdie was no longer the reckless young man he once was. He could tell that the Li Family was trying to avoid owing him a favor and be entangled in future troubles. It was a ruthless move, but Li Xijun now found himself at a loss for words at Liu Chandie’s broadmindedness.
Liu Changdie said warmly, "This is my repayment to Yuanjiao. I understand many things. If your family still has faith in who I am, please, do not keep forcing me to take any more of your Spirit Stones."
His eyes was clear, and his voice open and sincere. His request had firmly blocked any further offers of payment from Li Xijun.
Liu Changdie smiled lightly and swiftly shifted the topic. "I have had the chance to meet all the young masters, except for nephew Ximing… I wonder…"
Li Xijun smiled politely, though he felt a tinge of sorrow in his heart. He replied, "How unfortunate…Ximing is currently in seclusion to attempt a breakthrough."
Liu Changdie could only nod, a trace of regret in his expression. In his past life, his daughter had been Li Ximing’s concubine. Thus, he had some personal ties to Li Ximing. Even Ximing’s son, Li Chenghui, had studied formations under him.
When he thought back to his disciple, Liu Changdie felt a wave of nostalgia and said with a smile, "I once heard that the Bright Yang Dao Lineage is the most fertile. I wonder if that is true. May I ask how nephew Ximing’s descendants are faring?"
Li Xijun, however, was troubled precisely because of this matter. Ximing’s eldest son had recently undergone a root bone assessment, only to reveal he possessed no spiritual orifices. This had cast a shadow over Li Xijun’s mood.
So he merely waved his hand and said, "I believe that is merely a rumor. Ximing’s offspring are few, and his son has no spiritual energy."
These words left Liu Changdie stunned. His heart sank, and a cold dread crept over him. He worried that he might have unknowingly caused some disaster.
He thought to himself, How could this be… How… Meng Zhuoyun is from the overseas Meng Family, and the Li Family are descendants of Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators… How could this have happened…
The image of his disciple’s obedient face appeared in his mind, making his chest tighten with unease. His heart skipped a beat, and he could not resist asking, "Forgive this old man for prying… May I ask who Young Master Ximing’s wife is?"
"Madam An," replied Li Xijun.
Madam An!
Liu Changdie slowly closed his eyes.
Li Xijun noticed that Lie Changdie’s questions were becoming rather strange. Still, he had answered naturally due to the man’s earlier sincerity.
