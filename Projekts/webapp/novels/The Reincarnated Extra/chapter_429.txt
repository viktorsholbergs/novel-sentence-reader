Kobdaroze’s Desperate Struggle
* * *
<<<UOOOOOOOOOHーーー!!!>>>
Kobdaroze charged towards the monster with a deep roar!
At a tremendous speed!
If you saw him swimming, splitting the thin fog, from a distance, you would surely describe him as a ‘bullet’!
“…………”
Of course, the monster isn’t just going to watch this charge with her fingers in her mouth.
She gracefully moved a tentacle extending from her shoulder, and then shot it out towards Kobdaroze like a spear!
<<<Hah!!>>>
But Kobdaroze sees it!
He’s currently in a state of extreme concentration!
The monster’s movements…
And the trajectory of the tentacles she unleashes!
He can see them clearly!!
He leaned back slightly and dodged the spear-like tentacle with minimal movement!
“…………”
Even seeing that, the monster’s expression remained unchanged.
She just calmly shot out a second and third tentacle.
<<<Hah! Aaaah!!>>>
Kobdaroze dodged them, dodged them!
Swaying slightly from side to side, he narrowly avoided the tentacles!
But, however!
“…………”
This time, the monster shot out several tentacles simultaneously towards Kobdaroze!
An overwhelming attack with a wall of tentacles!
There’s no opening to dodge!
He’s doomed!?
<<<AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHーーー!!!>>>
But it was at that moment.
Kobdaroze’s entire body, letting out an especially loud roar, was enveloped in a dazzling red light!
This light…
Is proof that he’s using 【Body Strengthening】 beyond his limits!
Now, at this moment, Kobdaroze…
To protect his ‘little sister’…
Clan Chief Kobdalian… he surpassed his limits!
He wasn’t taught how.
He had simply… followed his instincts!
He converted his soul into magical power, and circulated that power throughout his body without a second thought!
But this is dangerous.
His body can’t withstand such a reckless enhancement, and all his bones and muscles are screaming.
The erosion of his soul is also a problem.
But Kobdaroze doesn’t care about any of that!
He doesn’t think about what will happen after the battle!
Just to defeat the enemy!
He swims straight ahead… straight ahead!
Clang!!
Finally, the monster’s tentacle collided with Kobdaroze’s hump, and was repelled with a metallic sound!
Clang!!
Clang, clang!!
The other tentacles that followed were also repelled by Kobdaroze’s body, unable to pierce him!
Countless cuts appeared on Kobdaroze’s body, but none of them were even close to fatal.
He’s alive!
<<<UOOOOOOOOOHーーー!!>>>
Kobdaroze broke through the barrage of tentacles, like a horizontal downpour, splitting the fog, and appeared in front of the monster.
“!!”
The monster, whose vision was blocked by her own tentacles, was delayed in reacting to Kobdaroze, who broke through them.
But she still has some time.
To show respect to this brave warrior, and to crush him with a single blow, she poured a vast amount of mana into her small fist, preparing for a sure-kill strike… 【Magic Strike】.
She’s proficient in this attack method, and doesn’t need even a second to prepare.
And to counter Kobdaroze, she quietly pulled her right foot back to get into a better punching stance.
At this moment.
Yes, at this very moment…
Heaven… sided with Kobdaroze…!
The bottom of this Eserem Sea of Fog is humid.
It’s only natural, since it’s a place filled with fog.
Therefore, the ground is always wet.
The bedrock is slippery.
So…
“!?”
Even if the monster, at this very moment, accidentally slipped and lost her balance… it’s not strange at all!
<<<OOOOOOOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAAHーーー!!>>>
The warrior Kobdaroze wouldn’t miss that opening!
Towards the monster, who lost her balance and almost fell to one knee…
He made the fastest and strongest charge of his fish life, exceeding his full strength!
Charging is his specialty.
He has crushed countless enemies that stood in his way, charging and smashing them with his tough hump.
That’s why he’s called ‘Kobdaroze, the Crusher’.
And this is his charge… surpassing his limits.
No matter how monster it is…there is no way it can be hit by that and be unscathed!
“G-Ooh…!?”
Kobdaroze definitely heard a groan of pain escape the monster’s mouth at the moment of impact.
And along with that voice, a liquid, probably gastric juice or something, fell onto Kobdaroze’s dorsal fin, sizzling and dissolving it.
He felt pain.
<<<AAAAAAAAAAAHーーー!!>>>
But Kobdaroze wouldn’t stop!
Because the monster is still alive!
Kobdaroze wouldn’t stop until he crushes his enemy!
Because he’s a warrior!
Because he’s ‘Kobdaroze, the Crusher’!
Kobdaroze continued his charge, his hump buried in the monster’s belly.
The monster’s light body floated slightly, bending into a V-shape, carried through the sea of fog by the red-glowing bullet.
And at the end of that charge?
…Is a sheer cliff!
ZUGAAAAAAAN!!
The next moment, Kobdaroze crashed into the cliff, taking the monster with him.
Zuga!
Zugagagagaga!!
And that’s not all.
Even after hitting the cliff, Kobdaroze continued his charge.
Kobdaroze and the monster’s bodies pulverized the cliff, burrowing deeper and deeper!
Gagaga!!
GAGAGAGAGAGAAAAAAAAAAA!!
And as a result…
The cliff collapsed.
Rocks fell from above one after another, burying the spot where Kobdaroze and the monster had burrowed.
<<<O-Onee-chan…! KOBDAROOOOOOOOOOZE!!>>>
Clan Chief Kobdalian was powerless against the rocks that crashed down on Kobdaroze and the monster.
All he could do was scream.
By the time the rockslide subsided, the surrounding fog had thickened again, and all he could see was the faint, blurry shadow of the cliff, its shape changed by the collapse.
<<<Aaaaah… AAAAAAAAAAAH!!>>>
His grieving figure, his heart-wrenching scream… which he, as the ‘Strong Clan Chief’, can never show the village warriors…
…Were all hidden by the deep fog.
<<<Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!!>>>
Kobdalian, after crying for a while…
<<<AAAH!!>>>
…Slammed his hump against a nearby boulder with all his might, shattering and blowing it away!
And then…
<<<…Huuuu…>>>
…He took a deep breath.
<<<Oh, our god, Godkob! Guide the soul of this brave warrior to the Mother Sea…! >>>
He said the words of mourning, his voice trembling, towards the collapsed cliff, and closed his eyes.
And he offered a silent prayer.
A deep, heartfelt prayer.
But he can’t spend too much time praying.
He’s the Clan Chief.
They’re currently on a march.
He has to catch up to the horde of warriors and lead them.
<<<…I’m going.>>>
When he opened his eyes again, Kobdalian’s voice was no longer trembling.
<<<‘Kobdalian of the Raging Flames’, the Strong Clan Chief, will surely destroy our wicked enemies!! Wait for me in the Mother Sea, Kobdaroze!!>>>
After declaring that, he solemnly bowed towards the cliff, then turned around and started swimming towards the warriors who had gone ahead.
His entire body was overflowing with fighting spirit… and in his eyes, the flames of determination burned.
His overflowing mana transformed into sparks, crackling and brightly illuminating the surrounding fog.
