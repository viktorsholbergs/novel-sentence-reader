Chi Wei's divine ability flared brightly in the sky until it burned out, leaving only a tiny, translucent point of light pulsing rhythmically, accompanied by the cries of a newborn.
Chi Wei's now youthful, handsome face showed resignation and relief as he murmured softly to himself, "This is the end."
BOOM!
Before he even managed to finish speaking, his body crumbled, disintegrating into particles that scattered as white and gray dust, leaving smoke trails like dragons in the sky.
The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators above whispered to each other. One of them remarked, "Chi Wei could not even condense the metallic essence..?"
Another Purple Mansion Realm cultivator looked up at the two blurry figures and heard one of them laugh sharply. "I knew your divine ability is Heavy Murk, so why pretend?"
The envoy clapped his hands, pulled out a gray net, and laughed. "I even borrowed the exalted immortal's Nine-Layer Attribute Net, just for a beast like you."
He pinched one corner of the net, cast it out, and pulled hard. His arms stretched into long strips like noodles, mimicking a tugging motion in the air. He laughed sharply. "You cannot escape!"
The net tightened, forming a twisting spherical shape in the air. The other figure laughed heartily, reaching out to help pull. The metallic essence screamed shrilly but was slowly subdued.
The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators looked on in silence, feeling a sense of shared sorrow. Below them, Chi Zhiyun was already in tears.
After securing Chi Wei's metallic essence, the two figures turned to the other Purple Mansion Realm cultivators and said, "We'll take our leave now, Fellow Daoists."
After that, the two figures grew even more blurry and disappeared. The rest of the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators also dispersed, leaving only a few standing in the air.
"The Azure Pond Sect has now lost its pinnacle Purple Mansion Realm cultivator… They will need to make substantial reparations!" A cool female voice came from above.
Immediately after, a refined, noble voice chimed in, "Absolutely, absolutely!"
The Purple Mansion Realm cultivators listened with mixed expressions. A heavy, clanging voice asked, "Why are you getting involved in this mess, Fox? Is Mount Dali's Demon Cave also going to intervene?"
The youthful voice laughed playfully before responding, "I am just listening in… Why are you all so sensitive? Though my ears can pick up whispers from lowly cultivators, it is much better to hear things directly."
Chi Zhiyun listened quietly from below. The remaining four Purple Mansion Realm cultivators in the sect slowly ascended, and the heavy, clanging voice said, "Fellow Daoists, let us test our true capabilities through action."
"I wouldn't dare ask for any compensation!" Li Tongya responded with a gentle laugh.
Xiao Yuansi shook his head repeatedly and explained, "My ancestor's original name was Xiao Jinzhou… He used the alias Xiao Xianyou of Lingnan while traveling to avoid implicating the family. Since this is a Grade Three footwork technique, he had to make it harder to decipher."
Li Tongya nodded and said, "My family has a daughter named Li Qinghong, who excels at spear techniques. However, her cultivation method is unique and unsuitable for marriage, so I did not bring her to meet you, Senior."
He deftly shifted the topic to Li Qinghong, subtly using this to transition the conversation and continued, "But my family doesn't have many legacies and lacks noteworthy spear techniques… If your clan has any, could my granddaughter study them?"
Xiao Yuansi nodded. The Xiao Family was aware of Li Qinghong but had not seen her in years since she was hiding with the Fei Family. They had even assumed she was dead.
After thinking for a few moments, he answered, "We do have a Grade Three spear technique called Wing Clipper… But that footwork technique is precious, and exchanging it for a spear technique would be unfair to you."
"Let's do this instead…" Xiao Yuansi shook his head as he continued, "Apart from the spear technique, my family will owe your clan a favor… That should be fair."
Li Tongya cupped his fist, genuinely touched.
"You are truly noble, Senior!"
Xiao Yuansi laughed, and after exchanging a few words, Li Tongya asked, "Senior, are you familiar with Yu Muxian?"
Xiao Yuansi raised his eyebrows thoughtfully, "This person is a disciple of Yuanwu Peak… If I remember correctly, he should be between the sixth and seventh heavenly layers of the Qi Cultivation Realm. He has some talent as a weaponsmith."
He glanced at Li Tongya and asked softly, "Do you have plans for the Yu Family? Given Yu Muxian's current position, the Azure Pond Sect would not protect the Yu Family if there was internal unrest."
Li Tongya nodded and then asked, "What about Yu Yufeng?"
Xiao Yuansi paused before answering seriously, "Ancestor Chuchou has fought him before… Yu Yufeng is strong and should not be underestimated."
Li Tongya fell silent for a moment, determination surging within him.
"Senior, do you think your family would help me kill this person..?" he asked finally.
"Kill Yu Yufeng…" Xiao Yuansi sighed and replied, "My family would have no problem helping, but this is not a good time for us to make a move. Moreover, killing Yu Yufeng silently is nearly impossible… Using Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators alone would create a disturbance that would offend Yuanwu Peak and many others."
Xiao Yuansi's hesitation was evident, and Li Tongya couldn't bear to put him in a difficult position. He promptly cupped his fist.
"I understand, Senior! If this option isn't feasible, my family will find another way. Do not trouble yourself over it!"
But Xiao Yuansi gritted his teeth and waved his hand, saying solemnly, "Well it's not entirely impossible…"
He thought for a few moments and continued, "I will present the River Crossing Torrential Step to convince the ancestor. Perhaps we can kill Yu Yufeng quietly while Azure Pond Sect is distracted by Chi Wei's death…"
"That would be excellent!" Li Tongya's eyes lit up as he bowed deeply and said earnestly, "Then I must trouble you, Senior… Do as you see fit, and if it does not work out, there is no need to force it."
"I understand." Xiao Yuansi nodded. After confirming the marriage between Li Yuanjiao and Xiao Guiluan, he then took the jade slip of River Crossing Torrential Step and flew off.
Li Tongya escorted him out of the formation before returning to the courtyard, where Li Xuanxuan greeted him with a worried expression.
Having overheard Xiao Yuansi's intention to marry a daughter from the Xiao Family's main lineage, he spoke anxiously, "Second Uncle… Could the Xiao Family have plans to annex our family? If so, marrying even this concubine-born daughter is worrisome!"
With nearly ten Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, the Xiao Family's power was enough to make Li Xuanxuan uneasy.
Even though the Xiao Family was willing to marry off a daughter from their main lineage, the Li Family didn't dare accept such an arrangement. If anything happened to Li Tongya, that daughter could easily serve as a springboard for the Xiao Family to annex the Li Family.
"That should not be the case," Li Tongya shook his head slightly as he dispelled such thoughts. "Senior Xiao Yuansi spends his years refining pills on the mountain… He lacks the experience of managing a household, so his good intentions may have led to this oversight. The relationship between the Xiao and Li families remains strong, so we need not worry about this for three generations."
He raised his head and said quietly, "I am more concerned about Xiao Guiluan, though. Senior Xiao said she is a clever girl, but we do not know her personality. Yuanjiao is already leading the Yuan generation, so if his wife comes from a powerful family, I am worried that the next generation could face unrest."
Li Xuanxuan paused, surprised by Li Tongya's foresight. He then remembered that Li Yuanjiao had been adopted by Li Chejing and was not considered part of the eldest lineage.
Thoughts of Li Yuanxiu made him sorrowful, and he spoke softly, "Right now, we cannot think too far ahead. With you around, Second Uncle, any problems can be suppressed."
Li Tongya shook his head and sighed deeply. "What good is suppression? If brothers hold grudges in secret, trouble will only surface after the elders pass away. The more I have seen of this, the more I fear it. We can only wait to find out what kind of person this Xiao Guiluan is."
Li Tongya looked quietly in the direction of the Xiao Family in Lixia Prefecture. He was already over sixty, and although reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm made him look younger, his temples were still graying, and he was beginning to show signs of age.
The moonlight was like water, and the evening breeze lifted his slightly gray hair. Li Tongya's mind flashed back to the busy, humble old man he once was, and he murmured a realization to himself quietly, "Overthinking has made my hair turn white."
