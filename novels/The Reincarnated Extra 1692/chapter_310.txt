Devour the Vast Ocean! The Marine Battle of Panemo Offshore! 1
* * *
“PYURURURURUUUU!!”
Zaratopu’s war cry echoes across the vast ocean.
This underling is truly filled with motivation!
Its timid attitude from earlier seems like a lie.
<<<Anego! Anego!>>>
Now, while cutting through the waves, scattering spray, and charging at full speed towards the giant marine creatures, a 【Telepathy】 flies from Zaratopu.
<<<Do you have any strategy? I’m sorry for being pathetic, but I can’t deal any damage to that giant shrimp or giant squid! What should I do!?>>>
<Indeed, Emi, do you have any plan in mind?>
“Get close…… and I’ll slash and punch!!”
I shouted while standing upright with my arms crossed on Zaratopu’s head, puffing out my chest!
<<<I see! Understood! I see, if you slash and punch them…… the enemies will die!>>>
Zaratopu shows its consent while dodging the giant squid’s tentacles.
<No, no, no, that’s not a strategy! Rather, hasn’t Zaratopu become somewhat stupid!? Are you okay!?>
……Extra-sama seems dissatisfied.
<And with that, it doesn’t change from before, right? Is Zaratopu just an assistant after all?>
That’s not true.
It’s clearly different.
“Zaratopu!”
I give instructions to my reliable underling at my feet.
<<<Yes!>>>
“First, we’ll go for the giant squid! Get close with all your might! Be careful with positioning! Circle around and use the giant squid’s body as a shield from the giant shrimp! I’ll finish it off, so you block all the tentacles!”
<<<Understood!>>>
The clear difference from before.
What we can do because Zaratopu became motivated.
In addition to “movement,” it’s entrusting it with the role of “defense”!
Until earlier, I didn’t count the timid Zaratopu as a fighting force.
I was thinking of defending against the claws myself when approaching the giant shrimp.
But Zaratopu will protect me.
If that’s the case, the story changes considerably.
I can focus on attacking.
Preparing for the strongest blow…… and strike it as we pass by!
“IKAAA! IKAAAA!”
The giant squid is still swinging its tentacles around.
From above, and from under the sea.
The giant tentacles approaching from all directions.
Their number easily exceeds ten.
As expected of a giant squid from a different world!
<<<Uooooh! 【Water Fish】!!!>>>
But Zaratopu doesn’t falter!
It makes the surrounding seawater float in the air…… creates water bullets in the shape of fish, and releases them towards the tentacles, over and over again!
Bachin, bachin, bachin!
The 【Water Fish】 collide with the tentacles, burst, killing their momentum and shifting their trajectories.
Frighteningly, it’s a hundred percent accuracy.
Zaratopu’s magical power control ability is indeed tremendous!
“Aaaaaah……”
Of course, I’m not just standing still either!
I use all the precious time Zaratopu has created for me to prepare for the attack.
The giant squid is wearing barnacles like armor.
However, its essence is a mollusk.
Judging from the fact that it didn’t seem to take much damage when I threw the giant shrimp’s carapace earlier, its soft body, along with the effect of magical power, probably reduces the power of blunt attacks.
In that case, what I should unleash is a slash!
“Aaaaaah…!”
I lower my hips and extend 【Black Tentacles】 from my shoulders.
And what I create by weaving them together is a giant greatsword!
As it is, that dull greatsword’s surface is coated with magical power for cutting, just like 【Mantis】.
This is the new technique, 【Black Greatsword】!!
“Aaaaaaaraaaaaaah!!”
I swung that 【Black Greatsword】 horizontally at the giant squid as we passed by!
There was no technique or anything.
It was just a blow that smashed Zaratopu’s momentum and my monstrous strength.
But it certainly reached the giant squid!
“I”
The 【Black Greatsword】, without even a slicing sound or sensation.
“KA”
Smoothly passed through the barnacle-covered body of the giant squid.
“AAAAAAA!?”
And cut it in two…… top and bottom!
ZA…… PAAAAAAHN!!
Letting out a tremendous death cry and scattering spray high into the sky, the giant squid collapses onto the sea surface.
I glance back to check its condition, and while its huge body floating on the sea surface is twitching a little, it doesn’t seem like it will regenerate from there.
If left alone, it will probably die on its own.
Its delicious-looking insides are leaking out into the sea, but it can’t be helped now.
“……Good.”
I switch my consciousness and face forward.
And what I glare at is the giant shrimp, boasting an imposing presence like a steel fortress.
“EBIII! EBIIII!”
Gachin! Gachin gachin, gachiiin!!
The giant shrimp is intimidating us by striking its two claws together in front, making a metallic sound.
The impact of the claws colliding creates a gust of wind and a wall-like wave that surges forward!
Its intensity is tremendous, and if it weren’t us, it wouldn’t be strange to lose the will to fight just by seeing that intimidating behavior.
But!
“Zaratopu!”
<<<Yes! I know what you want to say!>>>
“That’s just a bluff!!”
<<<That’s just a bluff!!>>>
“PYURURURURUUUU!!”
Letting out another spirited cry, Zaratopu further increases its speed towards the giant shrimp!
The end of the marine battle is near!
