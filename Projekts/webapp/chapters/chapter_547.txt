The Li Family conducted a modest funeral with all members clad in white mourning garments. Following the deceased's will, Li Xicheng kept the ceremonies understated. However, King Li Jiman of Mount Yue hurried back and mourned with evident sorrow.
Whether his grief was genuine or not, he at least showed the necessary respect. Li Xicheng helped him to his feet, observing that he had reached the sixth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, which was proof that he had been diligently training over the years.
Yet, in today's Li Family, a Qi Cultivator was no longer a key asset, and was merely part of the middle ranks that were in charge of helping with routine tasks. Each position on the spirit mountains was highly competitive, and recently, the Jade Court Guards counted dozens of Qi Cultivators. At this level, his cultivation was far from exceptional.
Li Xijun kept vigil in the mountains for two months. One day, he looked up to see the sky ablaze with the dazzling sun, with not a single cloud in sight. Raising his arm, he dusted off his sleeve, flicking away traces of ash.
A thousand li of lake waves… where could this sandstorm have come from?
Suddenly, he paused, a look of astonishment crossing his face as he thought to himself, Brother Ming has succeeded!
Li Xijun hurried down the mountain, where he indeed found the entrance of the cave dwelling radiating golden light. The wind whistled softly, and a young man stood inside, hands clasped behind him, his face youthful.
Streams of golden light and flame wove around him as he stepped forward with a smile and announced, "I have established my Dao Foundation! Six years of cultivation, and now, twenty-seven years in total—I have achieved the Radiant Origin Pass."
Li Ximing had broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm half a month prior, spending some time stabilizing his cultivation before finally emerging from his seclusion. In front of him, Li Xijun calculated the time, surprised. "Only… about three years?! Was it difficult, or did it just come naturally? How did it happen so fast?!"
Li Ximing paused, considering, then replied, "At first, it was very difficult… Gathering my power was exhausting. Even with high hopes, I had expected it to take at least five years. But just a few months ago, I suddenly had visions filled with golden light. My Immortal Foundation began consolidating on its own, progressing at dozens of times the speed of my own efforts, until it was fully formed… I do not know what caused it."
As Li Xijun listened on, the golden light jogged his memory of the Sun Seeker Ring. With his thoughts churning, he looked on as Li Ximing began proudly explaining, "This Immortal Foundation is called the Radiant Origin Pass. It draws down heavenly light and captures flame, allows one to tread upon beams of light, banish evil, dispel calamities, nurture life, and… and…"
He paused, catching himself in his moment of pride, then continued more seriously, "Its main abilities include two great wonders. The first is Seizing Celestial Light, which could channel heavenly light into spells, surpassing most dharma lights."
He performed a hand seal and the light in his hand transformed into a vibrant, brilliant gold, appearing almost as if he had mastered some special spell.
Li Xijun, having been trained in perception technique, stared directly at it without averting his gaze, nodding approvingly. Li Ximing continued, "The second ability, called Bright Yang Gate, summons a blazing gate that can suppress enemies. The more one's cultivation advances, the taller and more imposing this gate becomes."
He laughed, adding, "As for manipulating fire, the blending of yin and yang, treading on beams of light—those are minor techniques, not worth mentioning!"
After all, the Golden Palace Radiant Origin Manual was a Grade Four technique. The Immortal Foundation it formed was formidable, offering comprehensive enhancement across all aspects. Although it lacked a specialized technique, it still surpassed Grade Three techniques by a significant margin.
He was brimming with pride, so much so that he failed to notice the white mourning clothes draped throughout the mountain until he finally caught sight of Li Xijun's sorrowful expression, causing him to realize belatedly.
"This is…"
He froze.
Li Xijun sighed, saying, "Please accept my condolences, Seventh Brother."
Li Ximing's sleeves trembled as he came to the painful realization.
"Oh…"
His voice immediately choked with emotion. The joy in his heart dissipated, leaving him standing there in stunned silence for a few moments before asking, "When did it happen...? Has Father already been laid to rest?"
He murmured two questions, then began to cry, descending with Li Xijun as they landed on the mountainside. Li Ximing lamented, "Eighth Brother… I only wanted to put it off until after reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm to see him again."
Since that terrible argument after returning from the Xiao Family, Li Ximing had not seen his father again. Li Yuanping, filled with disappointment, had stubbornly refrained from seeking him out. Li Ximing, fearing the encounter, put it off day by day, unwilling to face his father's expression. He had not expected that this delay would stretch into years, until his father had already passed away without them ever meeting again.
Walking through the graveyard now, gazing at the rows of gray headstones, Li Ximing's face was wet with tears, his entire body trembling from head to toe. Cold sweat clung to his skin, unceasing.
He continued until he reached Li Yuanping's tombstone. The inscription was newly engraved, detailing his life's achievements. Li Ximing kneeled down weakly before it, and Li Xijun silently stepped back, intending to give him some privacy. But unexpectedly, Li Ximing choked out softly, "...Stay…"
So Li Xijun remained, standing quietly. In front of him, Li Ximing seemed more lost and fearful than truly sorrowful, crumpled before the gravestone. He kneeled there for a long time, until the full moon rose and soft raindrops began to fall from the sky, pattering down onto the earth. Only then did he snap out of his daze.
Li Ximing leaped up in a panic, glancing around before bolting away as if fleeing, rising into the wind in an unsteady flight back to his cave dwelling. Twice he stumbled over the doorstep, nearly falling flat against the stone table inside.
On the table lay a stack of small letters, each placed there by others outside his secluded chamber during his period of seclusion. Dazed, he picked one up, which read, "When will Ximing emerge from seclusion? The family's stock of thirteen types of medicinal pills requires sorting and distribution. If you have any free time, please come to see me."
The handwriting was firm, deliberate, suggesting careful thought. It was signed by his father, Li Yuanping, roughly six months earlier. He pulled out another letter, "If Ximing emerges from seclusion, please come see me."
This letter was more recent, only three months old. Li Ximing continued reading through all fifteen letters. Each was shorter and more urgent than the last.
The final letter was dated just half a month ago. At last, Li Yuanping no longer addressed him by his full name. His handwriting, no longer neat, was crooked and uneven, with just a simple message, "My son, come quickly."
Previously, Li Ximing had felt only a vague numbness, with little real grief. But now, a surge of anguish rose within him, overwhelming and relentless, as he realized the full weight of these words.
He dropped the letter as if struck, gasping, "Father… Father… I was wrong… Father…"
His mind thundered, and everything around him began to spin, intensifying the agony within his mind and body. His whole body, from his fingers to his toes, shook uncontrollably as the world fell silent.
Thud.
Gradually, Li Ximing regained awareness, finding himself slumped over the table. With both arms spread wide, he gathered up the letters, clutching at them and scattering them over the floor. One letter remained caught on his sleeve, the four small characters on it unbearable to read.
He was lost in a haze for just a moment before his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation restored his clarity. He stood still, his face pale and expression blank.
All this time, he had been too afraid to see his father, choosing instead to wait for his father to summon him.
However, Li Yuanping had held out stubbornly until the end. In the fading light of his life, he had gone from issuing orders under pretense, to subtly inviting, to pleading for his son's presence, and finally…to a sorrowful, dying gasp. Yet, not a single word had reached Li Ximing.
His mind was a blur, filled with confusion, but at last, he understood—those things he had been too afraid to face were now lost, and he would never have the chance to face them again.
