At this moment, an old, yellowed map was spread out in mid-air, fluttering gently.
"Old Ox, the border city of Qian Nation is quite lively," Chen Xun chuckled, watching the people coming and going through the city gates in the distance. "It’s great to be in a time of prosperity without so much war."
"Moo~" The big black ox grinned, shaking its head, causing the pots and pans around them to jingle and clink.
The eastern countries were too chaotic for their liking. Both Chen Xun and the big black ox disliked staying in such places. They never imagined that having a bowl of noodles by the roadside could coincide with a military siege...
"Although the cultivation paths in Qian Nation are dominated by the Top Ten Sects, they really do take good care of the common people," Chen Xun said calmly, with a smile always on his face. "If it were in the eastern regions, people wouldn’t just be stealing rice and chickens."
"Moo moo~" The big black ox nodded. Chen Xun's speech was becoming more cultured.
They had simple perspectives, having come from a village. Seeing the common people safe and sound was enough for them.
"If only there were no wars in the cultivation world," Chen Xun sighed, his eyes distant. "But how can others not fight?"
The big black ox turned to look at Chen Xun; its eyes were also dim, remembering those old friends destroyed by war.
"Hehe, it’s alright, Old Ox," Chen Xun chuckled, reaching out to pat its head. "They are always with us."
"Mooo~~" The big black ox nodded heavily, letting out a low howl.
**Whoosh!**
**Whoosh!**
**Whoosh!**
Just as they were immersed in their feelings, three disciples from a sect, all in the Qi Refining stage, suddenly flew past the border city on their swords at low altitude.
Some of the townsfolk saw them and cheered, bowing towards the sky. But the three disciples looked anxious, discussing continuously:
"Senior Brother, that Crying Spirit Sect is truly despicable, taking advantage of the chaos in Qian Nation's cultivation world to loot and pillage!"
"Hmph, if it weren’t for the Top Ten Sects guarding the eastern borders, the Crying Spirit Sect wouldn’t have such an opportunity."
"They're relying on having two Foundation Establishment seniors openly extort offerings from various sects. If this trend continues, the entire cultivation world will be in chaos!"
Though these three were only at the Qi Refining stage, they were still concerned about the future of the entire cultivation world, filled with righteous indignation.
Unbeknownst to them, an ox suddenly appeared in the low sky, flying parallel to them.
They cried out in surprise when they noticed it alongside them. How had a black ox appeared beside them?!!
A man with a smiling face, who looked even younger than them, was sitting atop it?!!
The three of them broke out in a cold sweat, staring in stunned silence.
Despite flying at high speed, the black ox seemed to be walking leisurely in the air, softly mooing.
"Senior!"
"Senior!!"
The three quickly halted in mid-air, bowing in astonishment. This had to be a legendary Golden Core cultivator capable of walking on air.
"No need for formalities," Chen Xun said softly, raising his hand. His tone was very gentle.
They felt a breeze lift them, their hearts uneasy. They had lost control of their flying height and almost collided with the senior.
"I’d like to ask you something."
"Please, senior, we will answer all your questions!" The three spoke in unison, their hearts in their throats, their pupils trembling.
"Don’t be nervous, we mean no harm." Chen Xun raised an eyebrow, his words carrying an inexplicable warmth. The three felt a sense of peace, and their anxiety lessened.
"Moo moo~" The big black ox echoed, indicating that they and Chen Xun were reasonable and not here to oxy the weak.
"Did you just say the Top Ten Sects are guarding the eastern borders? Is there another war?" Chen Xun asked softly. "I remember they all went to the Northern Territory. Why has conflict arisen again?"
"Moo?" The big black ox's eyes were also filled with confusion. There was no sign of this when they returned to the Qian Nation.
The three disciples looked at each other, thinking this senior was talking about events from years ago...
"Senior, you might not know, but the cultivators from the eastern countries and the vagabond cultivators from the Northern Territory secretly allied with treacherous intentions to overthrow the Qian Nation!" one of them replied through gritted teeth. "The Top Ten Sects are leading our major sects in Qian Nation, fighting fiercely in the Northern Territory!"
_What the..._
Chen Xun and the big black ox widened their eyes. Another war in the cultivation world?
"I see. Thank you very much."
"Senior, it’s our honor."
The three disciples bowed their heads in respect, feeling both honored and surprised. This one conversation was something they could boast about for a lifetime.
Chen Xun then took out three bottles of pills from his storage bag. "Since fate brought us together, take these three bottles as a gift."
"Moo~" The big black ox swayed its tail contentedly. They were seniors now.
"We dare not refuse the senior's gift!"
The three disciples' eyes widened. The legendary Golden Core cultivator’s unexpected generosity fell right into their laps.
Chen Xun and the big black ox turned into a beam of light, gradually disappearing into the low sky, leaving no trace behind.
The three disciples remained in a daze, clutching the bottles tightly, feeling a mix of emotions. They didn't plan to use the pills but kept them as family heirlooms...
In Huaiping City, the streets were bustling with martial artists and children playing. The taverns were packed, with loud cheers occasionally erupting, suggesting the presence of storytellers.
Street vendors' shouts filled the air, each trying to outdo the other in volume to attract business.
At an antique vendor’s stall, treasure hunters were everywhere.
"Boss, how much for this old ox bronze sculpture?"
"Hehe, young man, you have a keen eye. This is a family heirloom, a symbol of 'Old Ox Gazing at the Sky,' blessing future generations. I won’t sell it for less than a gold piece."
"With this quality, it’s not even a hundred years old. Don’t try to fool me. One copper coin, and I’ll take it right away."
"Deal, pay up!"
The boss pretended to struggle, looking reluctant as if he were making a huge loss.
Satisfied, the buyer took the item, while the boss gave a sly grin, glanced at the boxes behind him, and continued shouting to attract more customers.
Two hours later, Chen Xun and the big black ox were squatting in an alley corner, their mouths greasy from eating buns.
Passersby shook their heads at the sight, thinking these cowherds had found quite a spot.
"Old Ox, the cultivation world has turned upside down," Chen Xun said, smacking his lips, his cheeks still bulging. "They went exploring the Northern Territory together and ended up fighting again?"
"Moo moo~" The big black ox wagged its tail. As long as the war didn't reach the Qian Nation's heartland, it was fine.
Otherwise, Old Sun’s grave and its old home would be gone, and then it, Black Ox Patriarch, would have to step in!
"But how much can those Qi Refining stage disciples really know? It's probably just hearsay. As long as the war doesn't reach the Qian Nation, it's fine." Chen Xun chuckled, realizing the mortal world remained unaffected. "Old Ox, it’s time for us to return to Yongquan Prefecture."
"Moo!" The big black ox got so excited that bun juice splattered everywhere.
Chen Xun’s excitement grew as he spoke, and the big black ox became increasingly cheerful. This moment seemed to bring them more joy than breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage.
