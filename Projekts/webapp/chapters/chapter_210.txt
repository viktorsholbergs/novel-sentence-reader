Xiao Chuchou's words were gentle, yet they struck a chord of dismay in Li Tongya's heart, setting his mind ablaze with swirling thoughts.
As he gazed upon the old man's smiling countenance, he responded respectfully, "Through the years of our families' dealings, I've certainly gleaned some understanding of your family's situation. Ancestor Chuting has indeed extended kindness toward me, for which I remain deeply grateful."
Xiao Chuchou noticed the subtle implication in Li Tongya's words with his vague reference to their ancestor, Xiao Chuting. He simply nodded once and murmured softly, "In that case, there's no need for further elaboration. Our two families have long relied on each other… Should you attain the Foundation Establishment Realm in the future, do send word to my Xiao Family. We can then discuss arrangements for a union between our families for mutual support."
Xiao Chuchou was direct with his intention, and Li Tongya was a level-headed man and was deeply grateful to Xiao Chuting. Not only that, he was also the elder brother of Li Chejing and maintained good relations with Xiao Yongling. Over the years, correspondence between the families had solidified the Xiao Family's trust in him.
For Li Tongya, attaining the Foundation Establishment Realm would mean securing the support of the Xiao Family for the Li Family. Conversely, if he failed to achieve this milestone and perished, the relations between the two families would remain connected to the personal relationships between Xiao Yuansi and Li Chejing.
Li Tongya listened intently, his heart swelling with joy at the realization. Pragmatic by nature, he did not allow himself to dwell on the bluntness of Xiao Chuchou's words.
Instead, he silently reflected.
Xiao Family presently has Xiao Chuting, a Purple Mansion Realm Cultivator, and Xiao Chuchou, who is at the middle-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. Additionally, there are three other cultivators at the late-stage Foundation Establishment Realm and five at the early middle-stage Foundation Establishment Realm… Undoubtedly, they stand as a prominent family, rivaled only by the Yu Family of Linghai Prefecture, the Chen Family of Yuyang Prefecture, and a few others.
Even if the Xiao Family were to soon sever ties with the Azure Pond Sect and ascend to the status of the Purple Mansion Immortal Clan, they wouldn't be able to override the Azure Pond and intervene in Moongaze Lake's affairs. Nevertheless, their support would remain invaluable.
Moreover, the Xiao Family relies on our family to serve as a defensive wall on Moongaze Lake, facilitating the distribution of pills and dharma artifacts… Such mutual dependence fosters a symbiotic relationship between our families, naturally ensuring mutual benefit.
Li Tongya cupped his fist with a solemn expression, knowing full well of the Xiao Family's plans.
"I am grateful for the esteemed ancestor's faith in us! The Li Family will definitely serve as a barrier for your clan and safeguard the Moongaze Lake."
Xiao Chuchou chuckled, nodding vigorously as he helped Li Tongya to his feet, warmly clasping his hand. His aged voice echoed in the courtyard as he spoke gently.
"What are you saying? We're just looking out for each other."
After another brief exchange of pleasantries, Li Tongya and Xiao Chuchou returned to their seats and continued their conversation, touching upon recent events with increasingly composed tones.
As the conversation lingered and Li Tongya sensed the guests' impending departure, he quickly sent out a voice transmission through his mana. When Li Xuanxuan received the message, who was waiting outside the door, he entered the courtyard right away and presented four jade boxes.
"Here are four spirit items from our family… I humbly request the Senior's discerning eye to inspect them," Li Tongya said politely.
Xiao Yuansi set down his tea bowl. With his adept cultivation in alchemy, he swiftly examined the jade boxes, discerning their contents with ease before speaking.
"These four spirit items are common ingredients of the Qi Cultivation Realm. With my current knowledge in pill crafting, three of them can serve as supplementary ingredients and one as a main. If you trust me, you may consider selling the supplementary ingredient to my family, and as for the main ingredient, I can refine it into pills. We can split the proceeds as usual, and I'll arrange for its delivery to your residence upon completion," he offered.
Li Tongya was anticipating this offer from Xiao Yuansi. He quickly cupped his fist and bowed his head slightly.
"Then I'll take you up on that offer, Senior!"
Handing over the four jade boxes to Xiao Yuansi, Li Tongya listened attentively as Xiao Yuansi detailed the utility and value of each spirit herb. Upon receiving twenty Spirit Stones as payment for the three supplementary ingredients, they conversed a little more before the guests from the Xiao Family were ready to take their leave.
The two men bid farewell to Li Tongya and left the mountain's formation. After soaring through the skies for hours, Xiao Chuchou finally broke the silence.
"Yuansi, Rulian is already nineteen… How about arranging her marriage into the Li Family?"
Xiao Yuansi considered for a moment before replying, "I'm afraid she's not the right candidate. If we were to arrange a marriage with the Li Family, the groom should be someone from their generation of Yuan. Rulian belongs to the same generation as the generation of Xuan, and all the boys from that family already have spouses. It's not appropriate for her to marry into the Yuan generation… We should consider someone from the generation of Gui on our side instead."
Xiao Chuchou nodded thoughtfully, seeing the logic in his words.
"Then Guiluan it shall be… She's still young. By the time Li Tongya attains the Foundation Establishment Realm, it'll be the right time for her to wed."
Li Pingyi, now sporting a thick mustache on his upper lip which served as a symbol of his prime years, strode into the courtyard. He nodded toward his wife, who came over to greet him.
"You've finally returned, my dear… We've been looking for you. Auntie has been waiting for quite some time," his wife said with a small smile.
Upon hearing his wife's words, Li Pingyi hastened into the house where he found Li Feiruo seated with a smile. She had shed the elegant attire of Mount Yue for the plain dress of the Easterners.
She greeted him warmly, "Seems like you've been really busy, Yi'er… It's really hard to catch even just a glimpse of you."
Li Pingyi smiled awkwardly in response and replied, "I've already discussed the matter you mentioned with the Young Family Head, Auntie."
"哦？"
"Oh?" Li Feiruo perked up instantly, listening intently.
Li Pingyi continued, "Since you're aware of the matter on Mount Yue, the Young Family Head has decided to send you to Lichuankou in the west upon careful consideration… You'll manage the town, negotiate with Mount Yue, and regulate the influx of refugees across the border. He believes that this task suits you best, and within three days, you'll receive formal instructions to move."
Li Feiruo was delighted by the news.
"Excellent! I'm truly grateful for the family's trust, I won't let them down!" she beamed.
Li Feiruo had demonstrated boldness since her teenage years in Mount Yue and had a natural aptitude for management. Now presented with such an opportunity, she was more than eager to settle into her new role.
After conversing for a while, Li Pingyi was approached by a discreet clan soldier who whispered a few words in his ear.
"My lord, there's news from the mine. A precious pearl has been unearthed from the cave, and Lord Xu retrieved it clandestinely."
Li Pingyi raised his eyebrow in surprise, and as Li Feiruo noticed this change in his expression, she tactfully excused herself.
Li Pingyi courteously saw her off then turned his head around and exclaimed, "I wouldn't be surprised if Xu Gongming cannot discern a spirit item… But how can a cultivator at the third stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm not recognize such a precious item?!"
The clan soldier simply shook his head with a small shrug of his shoulders.
"Lord Xu only mentioned that the pearl emanated an immense aura, far surpassing that of the Embryonic Breathing Realm."
"Where's the item now?" Li Pingyi asked.
"Lord Xu is waiting outside the courtyard, and he brought the precious pearl along with him," the clan soldier replied.
"Excellent. Come with me to see the Young Family Head."
Li Pingyi led the clan soldier out of the courtyard as the main courtyard was adjacent to the side courtyard where they had been. After a brief walk along the stone path, they reached the main courtyard.
Taking the wooden box from Xu Gongming, Li Pingyi proceeded alone through the front hall and the middle hall. He eventually reached Li Yuanxiu, who was deeply engrossed in reading a wooden slip in his seat.
"Young Family Head."
Li Pingyi presented the wooden box with reverence, explaining the situation in detail. Li Yuanxiu listened attentively, and once he had finished, he gave a simple instruction.
"Open it up, let me take a look."
Li Pingyi complied, opening the box and taking out a dark and translucent treasure pearl, which was roughly the size of a fist.
Li Yuanxiu reached out to grasp it, feeling a slight tingling sensation in his hand upon contact. He examined it closely but found no discernible clues.
Raising an eyebrow, he remarked, "It seems to be a spirit item of the Qi Cultivation Realm… Uncle Qiuyang and Uncle Donghe are away on Mount Huaqian, and I'm not sure if Father and the rest are in seclusion right now…"
"I know that the senior at Foundation Establishment Realm from the Xiao Family came to visit this morning and just left not too long ago, so I'm guessing Granduncle isn't in seclusion."
Li Yuanxiu held up the precious pearl and instructed, "Send this spirit item to Granduncle later and have him take a look at it."
