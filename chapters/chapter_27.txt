That very night, Lijing Village was alight with laughter from every household. Children ran joyously around the village as if it was New Year’s, their laughter mingling with the sounds of merry chatter.
Liu Linfeng had organized a large bonfire in the village square. The villagers, encircling the fire, engaged in animated discussions about the day’s events, particularly the capture of the fearsome long worm. The men, beaming with pride, recounted their bravery under the warm glow of the firelight.
In the evening, Li Yesheng and a team of ten had laboriously dragged the long worm down from the mountain. They skilfully removed its scales, and the village women thinly sliced the meat, preparing it in three large wooden basins with onions, ginger, and wine.
The meat was left to marinate in the pots next to the fire. The villagers also brought a few dishes from home, enjoying the communal atmosphere.
Li Mutian, not one for such lively gatherings, chose to stay indoors. Consequently, Li Xiangping and Li Tongya arranged for people to guard the spirit root before returning down the mountain ahead of the others.
“We’re not that knowledgeable and know nothing about this spirit root and its effects. It’s best that we don’t do anything about it until we seek advice from knowledgeable sources,” Li Xiangping remarked as he sat by the fire, addressing his brother.
“Agreed,” Li Tongya replied, picking up a slice of meat from one of the wooden basins. He chuckled as he observed its thinness, which was like the wing of a cicada, and the faint luminescence within it.
“The ‘Lixia Secret Note’ states that consuming the flesh of demonized scaled beasts, birds, and insects while absorbing the essence of the sun and the moon can invigorate the body and replenish qi and blood. Father should eat more of this.”
“Someone already sent it home to him.” Li Xiangping stabbed a piece of the meat with a stick, roasted it over the fire, and continued, “That worm’s bile is as big as two fists. It was sent to the courtyard to be made into wine.”
As the two conversed, Li Yesheng approached them with Xu Wenshan by his side. Li Tongya raised his head and arched his eyebrows at them, signaling that the two could speak if they had something to say.
“You wish to carry out commercial activities on Guli Road and sell the surplus goods of the villages?”
Having listened to Xu Wenshan’s resolute description, Li Xiangping and Li Tongya exchanged a thoughtful glance. They recognized that Xu Wenshan’s plans closely mirrored their own.
After a moment of contemplation, Li Tongya responded, “That’s a good idea. You and Liu Linfeng will oversee this together. Aside from your men, you can draw manpower from the Liu Family.”
Observing Xu Wenshan’s excitement, Li Xiangping spoke with a serious tone, “Remember, there are still a few immortal clans along the Guli Road. To commence trade, we’ll need to negotiate with them. Start by sending scouts to establish contacts and identify populated areas along the road. We need to create a map first.”
Xu Wenshan listened attentively and then confidently assured, “Understood! Don’t worry, I've traveled the Lixia Road for over a decade and know it like the back of my hand. Had I been familiar with the Guli Road, I could’ve drawn that map immediately.”
With that, Xu Wenshan hurried off to gather his men.
Meanwhile, Li Tongya, who was munching on the meat, turned to Li Yesheng and suggested in a low voice, “Uncle must be bored out of his mind at home. It might be a good idea to keep him occupied with something worthwhile. Keep an eye on Xu Wenshan, he’s a sneaky fellow. Although we have half of the Liu Family watching him, we need you to monitor and ensure that Xu Wenshan doesn’t gain too much power.”
“Understood!” Li Yesheng responded promptly. His time spent closely following the two brothers allowed him to become well-acquainted with the intricacies of their work. Inwardly, he harbored a growing sense of caution toward Xu Wenshan.
“Gather some reliable individuals and construct a small enclosure around that curtain fig tree up the mountain to prevent prying eyes…” Li Xiangping instructed, then gestured for Li Yesheng to leave.
Once Li Yesheng left, Li Tongya let out a deep sigh and said glumly, “If our Li family had sufficient manpower to maintain control, we wouldn’t need to be this cautious with all our plans.”
Li Xiangping, quietly savoring the meat, tightened his clutch on the wooden stick in his hand and replied, “We should visit the market to buy a map. It ought to be straightforward, but given our limited cultivation skills, navigating the unknown depths of that market could be risky.”
“Don’t worry too much,” Li Tongya reassured him, smiling. “Jing’er joining the sect, the growth of our spirit seedling, and the discovery of disciples with spirit orifices, as well as this spirit root all signal the flourishing of our Li Family. We must be grateful for what we have to prevent misfortune.”
Li Xiangping paused, then nodded in agreement. “I’ll keep your advice in mind, brother!” he replied with a smile.
Li Chengfu's relocation to the main family’s village marked a significant turning point in his life. His status had undergone a complete transformation, not only due to his return to the Li Family but also because of the newfound respect he garnered throughout Lijing Village. People now spoke of Li Chengfu with a certain reverence, acknowledging his good fortune and elevated position.
Although he did not hold absolute power, he had at least recovered some of his influence. As he walked through the village, all the villagers greeted him respectfully.
Even the elders from the Ye Family who had once looked down on him now regarded him with envy.
Liu Linfeng, who barely acknowledged his presence, had to put up a smile now and address him as Chengfu.
Yet, Li Chengfu remained cautious around Liu Linfeng. He was aware of the latter’s longstanding ties to the Li Family. Despite Liu Linfeng’s recent fall from grace, no one could predict the future. Perhaps Liu Linfeng could recover his status.
Indeed, Liu Linfeng’s period of decline had only lasted a few months. With a single directive from the main family, he rapidly ascended to a position overseeing the management of dozens of men.
He was seen working in the village, coordinating efforts to produce a map. The smile that graced Liu Linfeng’s face these days was so broad and frequent that it seemed almost as if it would spill off his face!
Seated comfortably in the village store, Li Chengfu leisurely savored his wine, watching Liu Linfeng work tirelessly.
He chuckled to himself, musing, Liu Linfeng seems to lead a hectic life. Not as comfortable as my life, that's for sure!
His musings were interrupted by the curious villagers surrounding him. “Tell me, Brother Fu, what kind of special skills do these immortals have? Why are you guys always heading up the mountains?"
Li Chengfu, irritated by their prying, snorted dismissively. He flung his sleeve and barked, “Shut it! Move out of my way!”
He was no fool. With the Li Family now lacking manpower, he was deeply involved in the project of building a courtyard in the mountains—a task assigned to him and his two children. Li Yesheng had explicitly reminded him that this was meant to be kept strictly confidential, so he knew better than running his mouth for attention.
The middle-aged man was well aware of the importance of his child possessing a spiritual orifice and being a part of the Li Family’s bloodline. Apart from Li Tongya, Li Xiangping, and Li Yesheng, he was confident that his own child, Li Qiuyang, was destined to secure the fourth influential position in the Li Family. As for Liu Rouxuan, she was completely out of the picture since she was not even a part of the Li Family.
Having now adopted the Li surname along with his three children, Li Chengfu was acutely aware that the Li family's interests were synonymous with the interests of Li Qiuyang and himself. Therefore, betraying the Li Family was out of the question for Li Chengfu.
Dismissively gesturing for the idlers to leave, Li Chengfu finished his drink and strode away from the group of idlers.
“I’m leaving for work!”
He had little time to waste on idle chatter. The construction of the large courtyard on the hill was underway, and the deadline was soon.
