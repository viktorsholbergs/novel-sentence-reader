When news of Li Jingtian's death reached their ears, the Li Family entered a period of mourning. Although she was merely a mortal, she was still the daughter of Li Xiangping, the sister of Li Xuanfeng, and one of the family's oldest members.
Chen Donghe hurried back, carrying his wife's frail body in his arms. He seemed normal, and Li Yuanjiao received him at the border solemnly. Together, they walked back to the residence in silence.
Chen Donghe was seventy years old. Since he had only begun his Qi Cultivation at thirty, he retained his appearance in his early fifties. Nevertheless, he was still an elder in the family and stood tall at the funeral.
Li Qinghong had just learned of her mother Lu Wanrong's death, and now the body of her aunt Li Jingtian was being returned to the Li Family. With two relatives lost in such quick succession, she was engulfed in grief. The happiness on her face from the afterglow of her breakthrough was now overshadowed by sorrow.
After a busy period of six months, everything was finally settled. Since Li Qinghong was affected by grief right after her breakthrough, she needed another period of seclusion to stabilize her cultivation, leaving Li Yuanjiao to look after the family.
On Mount Qingdu.
Li Yuanjiao guided Chen Donghe into Mount Qingdu. Observing his uncle's steady demeanor and good health, he felt relieved and began politely, "We've caused you a great deal of trouble all these years, Uncle… Now that the younger generation has grown, you don't need to stay in that desolate place. You can leave the qi gathering task to them and focus on your cultivation."
"It's no trouble," Chen Donghe replied, bowing politely. He sighed before continuing, "Who do you plan to send there?"
Li Yuanjiao responded, "An Zheyan has two sons, both married to the daughters of the Li Family. They're mid-stage Qi Cultivators now—reliable and loyal. I plan to have them take turns gathering qi."
Chen Donghe nodded and responded, "I will write a letter to Bai Yinzi, then."
He paused shortly, then added, "Bai Yinzi is keen to form connections. He can send a few of his people to help us. Within twenty years, they should become our family's wings and pawns in the desert."
"Yes," Li Yuanjiao agreed readily. With a quick scan using his spiritual sense, he noticed that Chen Donghe had already reached the eighth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
Politely, he said, "Uncle has worked hard for many years, so I must reward you… I have a secret Barrier Breaking Pill at home. If you take it, you could break through to the ninth heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm."
"That… I'm already an old man. It hardly seems worth it to take such a precious pill! It would be better to save it for Ximing or Xijun," Chen Donghe replied with a frown on his face. He spoke sincerely, not out of politeness.
"I'm over seventy years old! What difference does it make whether I break through to the ninth heavenly layer now or later? It's better to give it to the younger generation," he emphasized.
Li Yuanjiao could only force the pill into his hand and assured, "I've left enough for the children. How can you inspire confidence in others if you don't take this?"
Reluctantly, Chen Donghe accepted the pill, mumbling a few words of the Profound Scenery Spiritual Oath before heading off to find a place to cultivate in seclusion.
Li Yuanjiao sat on a stone bench, gazing at the old books that Chen Donghe had brought back which were now piled on top of the table. These were all collected and annotated by Li Jingtian while she was still alive. He sighed softly as he put them away.
"Auntie… what a pity…" he murmured quietly.
He sat for a while in the courtyard before a tall man entered and bowed.
"Xicheng greets the ancestor."
Li Yuanjiao hummed in reply, raising his hand to help Li Xicheng up with his mana. Li Yuanping's health had gradually declined over the past six months, and most of the family's affairs were now in Li Xicheng's hands.
Li Xicheng cupped his fist and reported, "The family's output is increasing. The first batch of spirit fish raised through the demon beasts in the lake has been harvested and sold for seven Spirit Stones. In the future, we expect even more income—at least an additional four or five Spirit Stones every year."
"As for the two ore veins, they've been deeply excavated, but not many ores have been found yet. However, we should see output in a few years," he added.
When Li Yuanping took over the Li Family, it was facing annual deficits, and the family was in a state of financial turmoil. By the time it was handed over to Li Xicheng, the family had turned over a profit of over ten Spirit Stones each year. Li Yuanjiao nodded in approval at the news of the increased income.
"In recent years, the family has welcomed three new Qi Cultivators and five unrefined Qi Cultivators, replacing several Embryonic Breathing Realm members among the five peaks."
The Li Family was now showing signs of becoming a real clan with unrefined Qi Cultivators springing up like mushrooms after rain, alongside many pure Qi Cultivators. Li Xicheng himself had also reached the third heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm.
"An Zheyan is the strongest Qi Cultivator at the ninth heavenly layer. Chen Donghe and Uncle Xuanxuan are both in the late stage, while Tian Zhongqing, Xu Gongming, White Monkey, Chen Mufeng, Li Wen, and others are in the mid-stage. In addition, there are eleven early-stage Qi Cultivators from other families and the Jade Court Guards, making a total of twenty-seven pure and forty-one unrefined Qi Cultivators."
"As for Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, there are four members—Second Uncle, Aunt Qinghong, Senior Wushao, and Master Monk Kongheng. The Li Family has now caught up with the former Yu Family and has become the overlord of the lake!"
With a sigh, Li Xicheng continued, "Our family now oversees more than 450,000 people, but our spirit fields are limited and we've done our best to manage them. Since we're bound by the oaths among the three families, we can't move north. Otherwise, we could sweep through Moongaze, Milin, and Glacial Cloud… The Fei and Yu families wouldn't be able to stop us!"
The Li Family was thriving with newly promoted Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, as well as increasing numbers of pure and unrefined Qi Cultivators. However, as the seats of authority on the five peaks were gradually filled, a situation akin to that of 'too many monks and too little porridge' began to emerge.
Li Yuanjiao listened to Li Xicheng before nodding slightly and replied, "If we want to move north, we must first eliminate Yu Muxian, secure a position in the Azure Pond Sect, and make Moongaze Lake subordinate to Qingsui Peak to achieve success. Azure Pond rotates its management every seventy years, and Yuanwu Peak only has twenty years left."
Li Xicheng responded with a hum, prompting Li Yuanjiao to continue, "Now that our family has four Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators, we should consider setting up a branch overseas. Most of the local Foundation Establishment Realm demon generals already have some background, making it unwise to capture them. Moreover, establishing a branch out there will allow us to communicate with the outside world, obtain spirit items, and absorb the population."
Li Xicheng listened intently, waiting for his uncle to make a decision. However, Li Yuanjiao remained concerned and mumbled to himself, "Most of the large and small islands overseas already have owners, making it difficult to find a safe and spacious place to settle. Additionally, we need at least two Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators to maintain a foothold. Whoever we send out… might not be appropriate."
Li Wushao was the local power in the Eastern Sea and would be the most suitable choice for this task, but the excavation of the mine in Moongaze Lake had just begun. Without a demon general to oversee it, the demons might not follow anyone else's orders. If Li Wushao were to leave for an extended period, problems could arise.
As Li Yuanjiao calculated in his mind silently, An Zheyan hurried in, reporting respectfully, "Ancestor! A fox sent a letter."
"Huh..? Bring it here quickly!"
Upon hearing that it was from a fox, Li Yuanjiao eagerly responded, knowing that it must be a letter from the White Banyan Fox. An Zheyan wore a strange expression on his face as he nodded and exited.
Not long after, An Zheyan returned, gliding in on the wind while cradling a pillow-sized red fox in his arms. The fox had striking green eyes and held a jade slip in its mouth, appearing quite well-behaved.
