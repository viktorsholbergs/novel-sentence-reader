A Clue

<<<G-Nuh…? >>>
When Kobdalian woke up, he was outside the giant hole, surrounded by cliffs.
He had been rescued and thrown here by the monster that suddenly appeared.
And he seems to have lost consciousness.
<<<Nn…>>>
He floated into the air, enduring the pain throughout his body.
And then, he looked around.
The fog, which was so thick when he entered with his fellow Kobudai warriors that even nearby objects were blurry, has now completely cleared.
Thanks to that, he could clearly see the bottom of the giant hole.
And there, the monster was fighting.
Extending black tentacles from her body, the monster was engaged in a fierce battle with Calamity Humidafai, which had spread over almost the entire bottom of the giant hole.
She dodged radulae, dodged the snail flesh tsunami… and counterattacked every time.
But, the situation is not favorable.
The monster is able to fight, but that’s all.
No matter how much the monster attacks, Humidafai doesn’t seem fazed at all.
Even now, this Calamity continues to extend its body, towards the outside of the giant hole.
At this rate, it’s only a matter of time before that Calamity’s body overflows from the giant hole.
And if that happens?
What will happen to the Kobudai villages?
What will happen to those left behind in the village, those who can’t fight?
They’ll all… be devoured.
Devoured…!
<<<Ah… Oh god! Our god, Godkob! What are you doing!? Is this not the time to fight!?>>>
Kobdalian involuntarily looked up at the sky and lamented.
Now that Humidafai had stopped emitting fog, a beautiful blue sky spread out above him.
But Godkob is not there.
Godkob, their god, who is destined to fight the Calamity…
The super giant Kobudai, who eternally swims through the Eserem Sea of Fog, doesn’t show up.
<<<Damn it… Damn iiiitーーー!!>>>
Kobdalian despaired and cried out in grief!
“RAAAAAAH!!!”
But at that moment.
He heard that cry from the bottom of the giant hole.
The monster’s cry.
Drawn by that voice, Kobdalian once again looked down at the bottom of the giant hole.
The monster is fighting.
Continuing to fight.
In an overwhelmingly unfavorable situation.
Compared to the giant Humidafai surrounding her, the monster’s body is far too small.
And yet, she’s fighting.
Without backing down a single step.
<<<A warrior…>>>
He involuntarily muttered that word.
And a moment later, Kobdalian gasped.
<<<…Huhu.>>>
And he chuckled, self-deprecatingly.
Here he is, relying on god?
That’s not right, he thought.
<<<If I lose heart here… I won’t be able to face Kobdacleva-dono…>>>
The flames of fighting spirit were rekindled in Kobdalian’s eyes!
He definitely saw a warrior’s pride in the back of the monster, who continues to fight alone.
Then, what about himself?
He is a warrior too.
Then what he should do is not lament.
<<<It’s to fight…!!>>>
Crackle, crackle!
Sparks began to dance around Kobdalian.
His depleted mana has recovered somewhat while he was unconscious.
He should be able to activate 【Raging Flames】 for a short time.
He can fight.
He can still fight!
<<<But…>>>
What should he do?
That’s the problem.
An opponent that even that monster, a warrior stronger than himself, can’t defeat.
That’s Calamity Humidafai.
What can he possibly do against such an opponent?
Kobdalian thought.
He thought and thought.
As he thought, he stared at the bottom of the giant hole.
<<<…Ah!!>>>
And then, he noticed it.
Humidafai, extending its body to cover almost the entire bottom of the giant hole.
There’s one spot.
That it’s avoiding.
Because it’s avoiding that spot, there’s a hole there.
Something has fallen into that hole.
It’s too small to see clearly but Kobdalian immediately knew what it was.
It’s…
Shining white, bathed in the sunlight…
The key to Humidafai’s seal.
The starfish that Kobdarok dropped just before he died!
<<<…Alright.>>>
Kobdalian muttered quietly and…
Enveloped his body in an armor of flames…
<<<It’s worth… risking my life to try!>>>
…He charged towards the bottom of the giant hole!
