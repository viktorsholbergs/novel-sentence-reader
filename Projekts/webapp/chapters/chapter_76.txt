Li Chejing sheathed his sword. The bluish-white swirled around him like living water, casting a glow that danced like moonlit ripples on water.
Behind him, Xiao Yuansi dispelled the battered remnants of his dharma shield with a wave of his hand.
He chuckled softly and said, “Junior Brother’s sword qi is truly sharp. The condensed through the Moon Lake Autumn Reflection Technique is indeed remarkable.”
Li Chejing frowned as he broached a more somber subject. “I’ve heard that the Golden Tang Gate has invaded the Mushroom Forest Plain.”
Xiao Yuansi sighed. Despite the concern on his face, he tried to offer reassurance, “My family told me that the Li Family remains unscathed. Junior Brother, you needn’t worry too much.”
Li Chejing hung his head, tightening his grip on his sword as he voiced his concern, “Senior Sister told me that too, but... why have I heard that the Mushroom Forest Plain is undefended?”
Caught off guard, Xiao Yuansi hesitated, his voice dropping as he spoke. “The Golden Tang Gate seized the moment during Azure Pond Sect’s guard rotation to launch their attack... The defenders were outmaneuvered…”
As Li Chejing pondered over Xiao Yuansi’s fragmented explanation, Xiao Yuansi swiftly shifted the conversation.
“The demons haven’t been at their best behavior in the south in recent years. The sect has decided to bolster the southern defenses by deploying cultivators there. According to the roster, aside from our master, Qingsui Peak is expected to send two more members over.”
Li Chejing tilted his head to the side and asked, “So what’s Master’s plan?”
Xiao Yuansi leaned in closer and smiled. “To send both you and me there too, of course. Yuan Tuan isn’t good at battling, so she will remain here on the peak.”
He playfully patted Li Chejing on the shoulder as he continued, “Your dedication to swordsmanship requires real battle experience. How else to refine your skills if not amidst the harsh trials of battle? And as for myself, with my modest talents in alchemy, it seems the clan envisions me providing logistical support for you.”
Realization dawned on Li Chejing. Caught by the spontaneity of the moment, he responded with a laugh, “That’s going to be quite an adventure ahead of us. I wonder how long we’ll be gone.”
Xiao Yuansi nodded and advised, “Indeed, it would be wise to send a letter and inform your family. Remember, the sect’s request comes with the opportunity to negotiate for benefits, ensuring our efforts are well compensated.”
Li Chejing’s spirits lifted at the suggestion, eagerly asking, “Could we request a cultivation technique from the sect?”
“Technique?” Xiao Yuansi gave him a puzzled look. “You’ve already mastered the Moon Lake Autumn Reflection Technique, why request for another…”
After a brief pause, realization dawned on him. “Ah, you want to request one for your family?”
Li Chejing nodded in affirmation, prompting Xiao Yuansi to reflect further before cautiously responding, “Cultivation techniques are deeply guarded secrets among families. Requesting one outright could prove challenging.”
“It’s been quite some time, and my brothers back home have reached the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. Yet, they lack Qi Cultivation techniques. I was hoping to acquire one for them.”
Li Chejing laid his sword on the table, then continued dejectedly, “Cultivation techniques are treasures not easily parted with. Rarely do families bring their prized technique manuals to market, and even at the brink of disaster, they would rather see them destroyed. Finding an appropriate cultivation method for my family has indeed been a great challenge.”
Xiao Yuansi nodded and then offered a solution. “Why don’t we do this? The Xiao Family is willing to provide a cultivation technique. In return, I’d ask you to request an Essence Gathering Pill from the sect for my family.”
“Essence Gathering Pill?!” Li Chejing was taken aback by the request and hurriedly asked, “Senior Brother, are you about to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm?”
Xiao Yuansi shook his head and clarified, “It’s actually for an uncle within my clan. The Essence Gathering Pill could marginally increase the success rate of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Its ingredients might be common, but the recipe is closely guarded by the sect, making the pill a rare commodity that can only be obtained as a reward. I’m willing to offer you a Grade Three cultivation method in return…”
Li Chejing smirked and said, “Senior Brother, you really are a sly one. Although the Essence Gathering Pill is of the Qi Cultivation Realm, it is still a very valuable item. It cannot be traded for a mere Grade Three technique!”
Seeing the dismay on Xiao Yuansi’s face, Li Chejing laughed heartily and countered, “I propose an exchange for any two Grade Three cultivation methods from the Xiao Family and a qi gathering method.”
Xiao Yuansi gave him a look and then proposed, “How about one Grade Three and one Grade Two cultivation method, along with a qi gathering method?”
Li Chejing agreed with a smile. “Fine, but don’t try to fool me with those common stuff sold at the market. I want true arts, not ancient or secret techniques.”
Xiao Yuansi laughed at his comment and then described the few cultivation techniques available.
After Li Chejing listened to all of them carefully, he frowned and asked, “Do you have any Qi Cultivation technique that uses Golden Autumn In Lake? My home is near Moongaze Lake, so such techniques would be ideal.”
Xiao Yuansi shook his head and replied, “That’s wishful thinking. The only technique I’ve known to harness the Golden Autumn In Lake is the Moon Lake Autumn Reflection Technique that you’ve already mastered.”
Li Chejing nodded. After a moment’s thought, he made his decision. “Then let’s settle for the River One Qi Technique and Pure Spiritual Essence Technique. The geography of our home, with its abundance of reeds and rivers, would complement these techniques perfectly.”
Meanwhile, in the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche…
Li Xiangping emerged from days of seclusion. He had finally returned to his best condition and the mana coursing through his body was so much more refined. He let out a long sigh.
His cultivation, stagnant for years, had now advanced and edged him a step closer to a breakthrough in the Jade Capital Stage, the fifth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, which was a pleasant realization for him.
Stepping out of the stone chamber, Li Xiangping was greeted by the sight of Li Tongya who was quietly drawing talismans in the cave’s hall.
Meeting Li Xiangping’s gaze, Li Tongya smiled and said, “You’re out.”
The three stone chambers of the cave dwelling on Mount Meiche had been thoughtfully organized—one served as a store for Spirit Rice and other spirit items, while the other two were dedicated to cultivation in seclusion, with Li Xuanxuan currently in one of these chambers.
As Li Xiangping settled at the stone table, he listened intently as Li Tongya recounted his travels and the recent happenings within their family. Li Xiangping’s brow furrowed in concern.
“The Azure Pond Sect and Golden Tang Gate are beyond our control. However, we need to stay vigilant against the pressing threat posed by the Ji Family as they have already trapped our family in the mountains. Although the Golden Tang Gate has withdrawn, the Ji Family’s strength still overshadows ours…”
Li Tongya, with a solemn nod, shared further unsettling news, "Mount Huaqian and the Wan Family’s territory is now a complete ruin. When I passed through the Lu Family’s eastern territories, I heard about their loss of Qi Cultivators to the Ji Family, igniting a bitter feud that’s unlikely to dissipate.”
“That’s a good thing,” Li Xiangping commented, taking a sip of tea before continuing, “With the Lu Family preoccupying Ji Dengqi to the east and the ruins of Mount Huaqian below, the Ji Family will be tied up for the next ten or twenty years. This delay could give you plenty of time to attain the Qi Cultivation Realm, Second Brother.”
“Indeed,” Li Tongya agreed, setting his brush down. “I plan to sell off the possessions we have acquired from the old Daoist the next time I visit Cloud Crowned Peak. It should allow us to afford a portion of Minor Pure Spiritual Qi.”
Li Xiangping narrowed his eyes as he spoke in a serious tone. “As for Xuan’er, his resolve is still lacking. It could be because he has yet to witness bloodshed. By the time he breaks through to the Azure Essence Stage, we should let him lead our forces and confront the demons.”
He shook his head and said, “Well, I can’t blame him. He’s only fourteen or fifteen.”
Li Tongya chuckled and playfully teased him, “What does age have to do with anything? Back when he was only fourteen or fifteen, someone killed and dismembered a body to feed them to the wolves. Yet, after all that, he could still come home to eat a big bowl of noodles like it was just any other day.”
