Li Xizhi descended the mountain but did not immediately seek out Yuan Fuyao. Instead, he took a slight detour and headed toward the tall pavilion, landing just outside the central grand hall.
The grand hall rose eighteen steps above the platform, flanked on either side by stone statues of long-horned beasts. The roof was covered in bright yellow glazed tiles, with rainwater trickling down and dripping from the mouths of the statues, creating an atmosphere of solemnity.
Li Chengliao had just finished tidying up and was descending the stairs. His face, though similar to his father Li Xicheng's in its composure, carried sharper features and a more assertive demeanor. Seeing Li Xizhi descend on a stream of light, his feathered robes glimmering with flowing rainbow light, he immediately cupped his fist and greeted him, "Chengliao greets Third Uncle!"
Li Xizhi placed one hand behind his back and used the other to lift him up, smiling as he said, "No need for formality. This time I am here to see our family's heir."
Li Chengliao's face lit up with pride. He nodded and led the way to a side pavilion. They walked down from the jade terrace, passed through several corridors, and pushed open the courtyard gate.
Inside was a small desk. Sitting by it was a boy who looked about four years old, dressed in a short robe of white and gold. The desk was piled with two stacks of scrolls. One hand propped under his chin, the boy quietly read.
His nose was slightly high, and while his brow carried traces of childishness, his face showed the healthy, rosy fullness of youth. He sat cross-legged, calm and steady.
Li Xizhi walked closer. The courtyard was devoid of attendants, except for a white-haired old monkey sweeping the ground. The monkey, dressed in Daoist robes, was at the peak of the Qi Cultivation Realm. It kept its head lowered and seemed indifferent to the newcomers.
"Wei'er… this is your Third Granduncle," Li Chengliao said softly.
Li Xizhi smiled warmly and turned to meet a pair of dark golden eyes. Despite his Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation and sharp vision, he was taken aback by what he saw. The boy's irises shimmered with golden rings that overlapped in layers.
The golden glow flashed faintly and dimmed as Li Zhouwei shifted his gaze. The boy raised his golden-and-white robe, slightly tilted his eyebrows, and performed the respectful bow of a younger generation.
"Greetings to Third Granduncle!" Li Zhouwei's voice was soft and polite as he began to kneel.
Li Xizhi snapped out of his daze just in time to stop him, gently holding him upright. He muttered to himself, "Now I understand why the elders are so certain… Indeed, such a child seems to have cultivated both body and soul even in the womb. His very presence is extraordinary."
Lifting the boy to his feet, Li Xizhi motioned for Li Chengliao to join them. His tone turned serious as he gave instructions. "I have read that those who cultivate body and soul together face many ancient taboos. Though much of it is now dismissed as superstition, we should still exercise caution. For now, never allow this child to bow before others lightly. And avoid using his given name frequently—refer to him by his title, Heir, within the family. It is a wise tradition."
Li Chengliao nodded solemnly, committing the words to memory. Li Xizhi, though still startled by what he had observed, sat down with the boy and examined him closely.
"This child stands out entirely from his peers," he said after a long pause. "Yet he does not seem bound by any thread of fate. It is almost as if he possesses a Bright Yang physique."
As Li Xizhi scrutinized him further, a faint fragrance wafted into his nose. He carefully discerned it and raised an eyebrow at Li Chengliao. "Peony blossoms?" he asked.
Li Chengliao seemed puzzled and showed no awareness of any scent. Li Xizhi picked up Li Zhouwei, holding the boy's small hands in his own. The child frowned slightly but remained calm as Li Xizhi studied him thoroughly. "This child will grow up to be domineering by nature," Li Xizhi murmured. "Such a disposition is deeply ingrained."
He pondered for a while before shaking his head. "I must admit, my knowledge is limited. This child does not fit any known mold. If anything… if anything…"
He swallowed his thoughts, silently reflecting. If I had to describe it, all signs point to something akin to a metallic essence demon incarnate. But if that were true, such beings lack coherent thought and could never sit here so quietly.
Placing the boy down, Li Xizhi asked Li Chengliao for more details, falling into brief silence before saying, "No matter the case, we must downplay any potential threat. Simply attribute his traits to a Bright Yang lineage. As for his golden eyes, I will request a concealing technique from the sect."
He elaborated, "After the collapse of the Eastern Fire Grotto Heaven, Azure Pond Sect acquired many Bright Yang techniques, including several perception techniques. I have reviewed some of them before; at least one or two should suffice for concealment."
Li Chengliao nodded in agreement. Li Xizhi smiled as he watched Li Zhouwei practicing his calligraphy on paper. While observing, he asked, "Is the family's sacrificial ceremony prepared?"
"It will be ready by tomorrow," Li Chengliao replied.
Li Xizhi calculated the timing and found it just right. Wasting no time, he inquired about Yuan Fuyao's residence, mounted his rainbow light, and set off.
As he traveled, his thoughts lingered on Li Zhouwei's golden eyes and that strange aura surrounding him. He mulled over it silently, Once the eyes are concealed… with Azure Pond and Yue Cultivating Sect at each other's throats, everyone is already on edge. The Eastern Sea's Crimson Reef Islands are stirring as well, and several Purple Mansion Realm cultivators have recently passed… There shouldn't be too many complications.
With these thoughts, he soon arrived at the cave dwelling. After sending someone to announce his visit, he saw a handsome young man rushing out to greet him, saying anxiously, "Junior greets the Daoist! Please forgive my failure to greet you from afar—it is a lapse in courtesy!"
Li Xizhi, potentially the future peak master of Qingsui Peak, held significant status. When Yuan Tuan visited the Li Family in the past, the entire clan had turned out to welcome her. Now, the gap in cultivation and position between Li Xizhi and Yuan Fuyao far exceeded that between Yuan Tuan and Li Yuanjiao back then, making Yuan Fuyao's nervousness understandable.
Li Xizhi waved dismissively and entered the residence. Yuan Fuyao, steeling himself, followed the feather-robed Daoist into the cave and sat on the side. Li Xizhi began, "You have been in the Yuan Family for many years. Now that my master has gone missing and I have searched the Eastern Sea to no avail, I have come to ask if the Yuan Family has any news. What is the current situation?"
Yuan Fuyao hesitated briefly before answering, "My family… has five main branches. My father is not part of them… There is some friction between the branches, and the truth is… the legacy left by the ancestor is not sufficient to share among them."
Yuan Fuyao continued bitterly, "Ancestor Huyuan leads the first main branch, but now they lack talent, with only him as a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. As for Yuan Tuan, the family only knows she went to Qunyi, and there is no other information."
Li Xizhi acknowledged with a hum, glancing at Yuan Fuyao but making no further comment. In a calm tone, he asked, "What are your plans?"
Sweat faintly appeared on Yuan Fuyao's brow as he replied, "I… I will follow my family's orders and cultivate with your clan until my father returns."
Li Xizhi nodded and said, "Very well, I will take that as your intention."
He smiled slightly and suddenly stood up. Caught off guard, Yuan Fuyao realized his words were somewhat off but could only gape at the feather-robed Daoist. Meeting Li Xizhi's sharp, sidelong glance, Yuan Fuyao found himself unable to speak.
Disappointment briefly flickered in Li Xizhi's eyes as he slowly walked out of the cave dwelling. Stopping on the steps, he casually remarked, "The ties between our two families run deep. Young Master may stay as long as you wishes."
