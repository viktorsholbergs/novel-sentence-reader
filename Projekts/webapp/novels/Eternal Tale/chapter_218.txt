At dusk, the faint rays of the setting sunbathed the earth in a serene, almost meditative light.
A figure, slowly riding an ox, meandered across the vast Tian Duan Plains. The rider wore a straw hat and carried a drawing board, sketching as they traveled.
Along the way, some spirit beasts considered launching a surprise attack. However, a sudden, overwhelming sense of terror gripped them, causing them to back off instantly. They started munching on grass in bewilderment. Once the rider had passed, the beasts spat out the grass in pain, realizing they had just been passing through.
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!
Suddenly, a fierce chase erupted in the sky above. Two mid-stage Golden Core spirit beasts were pursuing a large, fierce-looking early-stage Nascent Soul beast, an ancient Blazing Red Lion!
Chen Xun and his big black ox were stunned. They had heard of this beast, which had long been extinct in the cultivation world of the Qian Nation, but now they encountered one here.
The flesh of the Blazing Red Lion was a valuable resource, providing great benefits to both cultivators and spirit beasts, even aiding in breakthroughs. The beast was highly praised in ancient spirit beast compendiums.
But the scene was odd—wasn't this supposed to be an early-stage Nascent Soul spirit beast?
A strong gust of wind rose in the sky.
The Blazing Red Lion fled, its enormous body stretching over 20 meters long, a sight to behold. Each step it took left a trail of fiery light, stunningly magnificent.
Roar!
The Blazing Red Lion turned its head and let out an enraged roar, but its fierce expression quickly became one of cowardice and fear. It just wanted to live peacefully until it died of old age. Why were they still chasing it?
Due to the traits of its species, many spirit beasts and cultivators hunted it.
Its life had been filled with tragedy. Shortly after its birth, its entire clan was wiped out.
However, its natural timidity helped it survive many disasters, allowing it to wander the Tian Duan Plains for years.
It had no thoughts of revenge—survival was enough for it, without any grand ambitions.
The shadows of its childhood trauma affected its entire life, much like it would a human. It avoided hunting and preferred sneaking into others’ homes, causing many spirit beast eggs or wives to suffer its mischief.
After breaking through to the Golden Core stage, it stopped engaging in such petty theft, but its flesh became even more tempting.
Moreover, since it never joined any spirit beast group, it fled at the first sign of danger. This gave it a bad reputation, and no spirit beasts offered it protection.
However, after it reached the Nascent Soul stage, its life improved. Its body grew even more imposing, scaring off many spirit beasts, and it even visited several spirit beast tribes as a guest.
But whenever a tribe faced danger, it would only pretend to help, never actually fighting, and then quietly run away...
Roar!
The Blazing Red Lion was furious now. Even a clay figurine has a temper—why wouldn't they stop chasing it?
In a flash, a red light surged, and its Nascent Soul emerged. The two Golden Core spirit beasts paused in shock—this Blazing Red Lion was actually at the Nascent Soul stage?!
Roar! Roar!
Shrieks of pain echoed in the sky as blood rained down. The two Golden Core spirit beasts were severely injured, and the Blazing Red Lion, equally terrified, transformed into a streak of red light and fled.
Chen Xun and the big black ox were equally stunned. What kind of strange spirit beast was this?
They had seen many spirit-beast battles along their journey but had never encountered a Nascent Soul-level one. This first encounter was unexpectedly entertaining.
Their eyes filled with curiosity as they disappeared silently, following the pursuit.
Half a day later. The Blazing Red Lion found a spot without any other spirit beasts and began digging a hole.
It preferred living underground, a skill that had helped it survive many hardships, as no spirit beast could spot it from above.
The hole grew larger, and it used its innate abilities to conceal the area around it. It wanted to rest.
Having reached the Nascent Soul stage, it felt that this was likely the end of its journey. No Blazing Red Lion had ever been known to reach the Divine Transformation stage, and its bloodline potential was almost exhausted.
It let out a deep sigh and lay down on the soil, eyes filled with hope. It wished to spend the next 2,000 years peacefully on the Tian Duan Plains.
The Blazing Red Lion's life span was long; at the Nascent Soul stage, it could live for about 3,000 years, but few ever died of old age.
It had no desire to dominate any group or compete for resources—just surviving was enough to make it happy.
“Heh, Red Lion friend, may we have a word?”
Roar?!!
The Blazing Red Lion’s eyes widened in shock as it leapt up, dust flying everywhere. It was almost scared to death—where did this voice come from?
Before it, two blurred figures slowly appeared: a human and an ox!
It’s over, I’m done for!
Cold sweat dripped from the Blazing Red Lion’s once majestic face as it exhaled deeply, looking at the two small figures in front of it, feeling utterly powerless.
It had already secretly prepared its Nascent Soul for escape—if it had to, it would abandon its body and let them have its flesh!
“No need to be nervous. We mean you no harm.”
“Moo-moo~~”
As they spoke, an overwhelming spiritual pressure filled the area, the power of the Five Elements locking down the Blazing Red Lion, rendering its Nascent Soul immobile.
The Blazing Red Lion collapsed weakly, its pupils trembling—it had been subdued even though it was on guard?!
Tears welled up in its eyes as it lay helpless on the ground. After subduing it, they had the nerve to tell it they were good people.
“Senior…” The Blazing Red Lion awkwardly spoke in human language. “I’ve never harmed humans or oxen. Please spare me—I’ll guide you anywhere you wish!”
Its big, black eyes darted around. Perhaps these two were hunting on the Tian Duan Plains? As long as it survived now, it could find a chance to escape later.
“Hmm, make yourself a bit smaller. It’s tiring talking while looking up at you.” Chen Xun smiled calmly. “We’re not here to take your life. It’s fate that brought us together, so let’s be friends.”
“Moo-moo~~” The big black ox grinned, agreeing with its companion.
“Huh? That’s wonderful!”
The Blazing Red Lion seemed quite simple-minded, its eyes lighting up with joy as it began to shrink in size… until it was the size of a dog?!
Chen Xun and the big black ox were dumbfounded. They had heard of spirit beasts being able to change their size, but never this small.
“Senior, is this size okay?” the Blazing Red Lion asked with a fawning smile. “As long as you don’t harm me, anything is fine.”
“Of course.”
“Moo~”
The atmosphere relaxed as the binding force of the Five Elements gradually dissipated.
“Thank you both for sparing my life!”
The Blazing Red Lion bowed in gratitude, but just as Chen Xun and the big black ox were about to speak, it erupted in red light, its Nascent Soul escaping, attempting to flee!
“Old ox, this beast wants to play tricks! Beat it!”
“Moo-moo~~!”
“Aah!!!”
The Blazing Red Lion's eyes bulged in disbelief. A formation had already been set up around it—its Nascent Soul had no way to escape. It had been outwitted!
“You think you can trick us? You're still too young for that. Old ox, give it a good beating!”
“Moo!!”
“Seniors, I was wrong!!!~~~”
Shrieks of agony and tremors echoed from the hole, and cracks formed in the ground.
The Blazing Red Lion, caught between Chen Xun and the big black ox, was thrown around in pain, coughing up blood for effect.
Its body was incredibly tough, much stronger than the ground's rebound, but it had to pretend to suffer. It hoped they would vent their anger and stop.
After a short while, the Blazing Red Lion lay in a pit, eyes vacant and foaming at the mouth, now shrunk to the size of the big black ox.
The reason? The two had requested it shrink to this size to make it easier to beat.
Chen Xun and the big black ox exchanged glances, puzzled. Why was this Nascent Soul beast so weak? They hadn’t even used much force.
