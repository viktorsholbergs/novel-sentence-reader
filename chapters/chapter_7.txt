The morning sunlight burst forth from Mount Dali, bathing Moongaze Lake in a golden glow. The wind whispered through the reeds, carrying the distant sound of children laughing along the Meiche River.
Chen Erniu sat on a ridge, his gaze heavy with worry as he surveyed the crops in his field, his mind clouded with thoughts about his bedridden wife.
Born in Lichuankou Village on the eastern side of Mount Dali, Chen Erniu had witnessed a severe drought there ten years ago. The ground had cracked, emitting white smoke, sending the villagers into a panic.
As a young boy lost in the chaos, he fled to Lijing Village, where the farmer Li Genshui took him in. The following year, he was given a plot of land to farm.
As he grew older, he rented another plot of land, built a house, married Li Genshui’s daughter, and settled down in the village.
However, his wife’s sudden illness weighed heavily on him. Thankfully, he had some savings and sought the help of the scholar who lived near the village entrance.
The illness was minor, treatable with a few doses of medicine. However, he was still worried about the potential financial strain if her condition were to worsen.
“Uncle[1]!” Lost in thought, Chen Erniu was startled by a cheerful voice.
Looking up, he saw a handsome young man at the courtyard entrance, smiling warmly in greeting.
“Ah, it’s you, Changhu! Please, I hardly deserve such respect!” Chen Erniu replied modestly, bending over slightly. As a tenant farmer married to a concubine's daughter of the Li Family, he felt undeserving of such honor.
Li Genshui, though intelligent and capable, had a wandering eye. Unsatisfied with just one wife, he took two concubines.
With his first wife, he fathered two sons. From his concubines, he had three sons and four daughters.
Li Genshui was dying of old age, and the youngest son to his first wife who remained by his side suddenly died. Meanwhile, the children born to his concubines were eyeing the family’s fields.
Li Mutian, who had been away from home, returned with a saber in hand, alongside his men. This formidable veteran ruthlessly killed the housekeeper who conspired against the family. No one from the prominent family who poisoned his younger brother was spared for poisoning his younger brother, not even their dogs.
Li Mutian, flanked by his two men, his saber still dripping with blood, dragged the dead bodies away on a cart through the village. From one end to the other, they left a trail of blood, sending a clear message. The villagers shuttered their homes, sensing the danger.
Li Mutian’s illegitimate younger brothers, were initially terrified, thinking that they would have no share of the fields now that the Li Genshui’s legitimate heir had returned.
To their surprise, Li Mutian gathered them together. He declared that regardless of status, they all shared the same blood. He then generously distributed the family’s lands—two mus[2] to each of the family members, and four mus to each of the two men he brought here.
Overwhelmed with gratitude, everyone addressed him as the head of the family, solidifying his leadership within the Li Family.
As Chen Erniu gazed at Li Changhu’s gentle smile, he could not help but recall Li Mutian’s face, starkly marked by blood splatters in jarring contrast. Even under the warmth of the sun, this haunting image sent a shiver down his spine.
Nevertheless, he respectfully asked, “Changhu, what brings you here?”
“Uncle, you’re being too formal with me. I heard Auntie is unwell. My father figured you might be too busy to cook, so he sent me to invite you and Little Ze over for a home-cooked meal prepared by my mother,” Li Changhu replied with a smile.
“Oh… I can’t possibly impose…” Chen Erniu replied with an embarrassed smile, looking clearly torn.
“It’s settled, then! Mother has already prepared everything,” Li Changhu insisted, patting Chen Erniu’s shoulder before taking his leave.
“All right," Chen Erniu agreed, shaking his head in amusement.
He called into the house, “Little Ze, get changed. We’re going to your uncle’s house for dinner tonight.”
The Li Family had renovated their mansion two years prior, expanding it significantly. The estate stretched from north to south in a rectangular shape. The front yard, paved with stone bricks and adorned with stone locks[3], looked like a martial arts training ground.
Chen Erniu could not help but admire the heavy stone locks, remarking, “The Li Family sure keeps up with their martial arts training. Those look really heavy."
Entering the main courtyard, they were greeted by a pond in the middle, which was home to several blue fish. The courtyard branched off to the side houses of Li Changhu and Li Tongya, located on the left and right. Various rooms lined the connecting corridors. The grandeur of the estate was further accentuated by the meticulously laid stone paths and steps.
Li Tongya, now eighteen and yet unmarried, greeted them as they entered. Li Changhu had recently married the second daughter of the Ren Family in a grand ceremony.
After dinner with the Li Family, Chen Erniu sat in the courtyard chatting when he noticed Li Chejing rush into the yard to whisper something to Li Mutian.
Although only nine years old, Li Chejing possessed a strikingly handsome appearance and displayed clear signs of intelligence. He was a favorite among all the relatives and his siblings.
Li Mutian, who had been casually watching his children, leaned in to hear Li Chejing's hushed words—“Father, the mirror... it’s glowing!”
Nodding, Li Mutian patted his legs and addressed the group, “This old man needs some rest now. Please, don't mind me and carry on with your conversations.”
With that, he turned and headed to the backyard. After the group acknowledged Li Mutian with nods and murmurs of understanding, Chen Erniu rose promptly. He bowed respectfully and announced his intention to leave.
There were several rooms in the backyard. Li Mutian entered the central ancestral hall, the most spacious of them all.
In there, offerings of fruits and melons were presented to their six generations of ancestors, whose histories were traced through the village records.
Pushing on one of the walls, he revealed a hidden room behind the hall.
The roof window above was open, allowing moonlight to bathe the bluestone platform below. Resting upon it, a grayish-blue bronze mirror emitted a bright, watery white light.
“It’s been three years... Jing’er, go get your brothers over here,” Li Mutian said, staring at the mirror with a furrowed brow.
“Right away,” Li Chejing responded energetically before hurrying off to find his siblings.
Upon waking, Lu Jiangxian’s mind overflowed with newfound knowledge. He paused, taking as long as an incense stick would take to burn, to compose his thoughts. Then, he began to carefully explore the wealth of information contained within the jade.
The Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra!
The doctrine focused on manipulating the spiritual qi of heaven and earth through the human body’s “orifices”. It involved stirring up the supreme yin energy of the moonlight, ultimately cultivating it into the six chakras of Embryonic Breathing.
Mastery of these chakras could prolong life, nurture one’s spirit, and enable the casting of various spells. Once the six chakras were fully developed, akin to a full moon, one could progress to the Qi Cultivation realm.
Additionally, the scripture outlined several minor spells, such as the Golden Light, Purify, Water Avoidance, Exorcism, and the Mind Net.
These could be practiced once the six chakras were cultivated, harnessing the spiritual qi in accordance with the scripture’s teachings.
Furthermore, the scripture delineated the six realms of immortal cultivation—Embryonic Breathing, Qi Cultivation, Foundation Establishment, Purple Mansion, Golden Core, and Nascent Soul.
The jade recorded the Embryonic Breathing Meridian Nourishment Technique from Moonlight Origin Mansion of Yue State and distributed to disciples from the Moonlight Immortal Mansion at the Embryonic Breathing realm.
After absorbing the jade’s knowledge, Lu Jiangxian experienced a profound transformation. His divine sense expanded to 66 meters, and the capacity of his moonlight energy increased exponentially.
With sufficient moonlight energy, he could perform the various minor spells recorded in the Supreme Yin Breathing Meridian Nourishment Sutra, anywhere within three meters of the mirror.
Most importantly, a specific spell from the mirror’s memory emerged prominently in his mind—the Profound Pearl Sacrificial Spirit!
