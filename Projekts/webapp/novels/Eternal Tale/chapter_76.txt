Two days later.
Ji Kun personally went to apologize outside Elder Dai's cave, but he had to stand outside for a full hour before being allowed in.
He looked slightly annoyed, but thinking of Chen Xun's words, he forcibly turned it into a smile.
Inside the cave, a series of scoldings could be heard, but every time Ji Kun wanted to get angry, he kept thinking of Chen Xun and had to smile apologetically while explaining.
Finally, the scolding became smaller, and occasional bursts of laughter could be heard.
Elder Dai said that the matter was over and praised Ji Kun for his sincerity.
The matter of the female disciple in the Foundation Building stage was also let go by Ji Kun, not wanting to stir up trouble again.
He didn't want to lose face, and he could guess Ji Kun's intentions. However, Ji Kun didn't care at all. He just said that it was for the sake of apology and explanation, with no other intentions, and he had let go of any hatred in his heart.
Elder Dai was very satisfied with Ji Kun's temperament, showing a willingness to recruit him.
This person was talented, flexible, and had just broken through the Foundation Building stage, showing great potential.
Ji Kun continued to laugh, saying that he needed to consider it as it was a major decision that affected his future, but without any intention of confrontation.
Elder Dai understood and asked Ji Kun to think it over, promising many benefits and expressing appreciation in every sentence.
He also said that regardless of whom Ji Kun chose in the future, based on his actions that day, any grievances between them were settled. Elder Dai showed Ji Kun what it meant to have a broad mind.
On his way back, Ji Kun looked deep in thought, repeatedly echoing Chen Xun's words.
He felt like he grasped something, but it seemed incomplete. He muttered, "In the end, sticking to the original intention..."
Now, that was killing the woman for sure, then joining Elder Li's camp, the archenemy of Elder Dai. They were also a significant force among the outer disciples, and he wasn't afraid of this person at all.
However, he couldn't kill the woman, as even Elder Dai could guess his intentions.
After a few more days, Ji Kun officially announced his affiliation with Elder Li.
When Elder Dai heard this news, his blood pressure instantly rose, and for several days, he couldn't calm down, becoming increasingly angry.
In the following days, Ji Kun, being a loose cultivator, dared to kill and fight. He displayed bloodthirstiness and strength far beyond the disciples of the sect, continuously earning merit for the sect. Elder Li was delighted and pleased with his performance.
Even during the gathering of the outer disciples and elders, Elder Li constantly mentioned Ji Kun.
He said that the outer disciples needed people who dared to fight and kill, and even other elders nodded in approval.
Elder Dai's blood pressure rose even more, his thoughts became less clear, and he couldn't express the bitterness in his heart. Ji Kun clearly should have been under his command.
He recalled Ji Kun's apology that day, sincere in every word. The events of that year were indeed filled with many doubts, and even the sect's law enforcement hall had not reached a conclusion.
Elder Dai gradually turned his gaze towards Su Yetong. It was she who caused discord and led to the loss of a Foundation Building stage powerhouse!
Su Yetong, who was awakened by nightmares every night, found it unbelievable that Ji Kun had broken through the Foundation Building stage. Killing her, a tenth-level Qi refining disciple, was as easy as turning one's hand.
But Ji Kun had never come looking for trouble. Instead, he made her increasingly fearful—a move that struck the heart!
Her reputation among the outer disciples was rising, and every day she became more anxious and fearful, sometimes even screaming when encountering a man.
She even went crazy, telling others that Ji Kun wanted to kill her, and finally sought refuge with Elder Dai.
Elder Dai was infuriated by her actions. Ji Kun didn't even take her seriously, and her aggressive behavior made him feel ugly and disgusted.
Subsequently, Elder Dai assigned her several extremely dangerous tasks, and Su Yetong finally met her end in an accident. Her body was eaten by demonic beasts, leaving nothing but a tragic end.
This small matter did not cause any waves; it was too normal for a Foundation Building stage disciple to die during a mission.
Ji Kun, on the other hand, was providing perfect alibi evidence while executing another mission.
Upon returning to the sect, there were many people flattering Ji Kun, saying that the death of that woman was good, and they always knew that Senior Ji was wronged back then!
Due to the death of this woman, Ji Kun's reputation was even elevated. Countless outer disciples and sect elders were cursing Su Yetong. Senior Ji was not someone that this kind of person could wrongly accuse.
Ji Kun now exuded a strong killing intent, his whole body filled with a cold and stern aura. He paid no attention to those who flattered him.
Instead, he returned to his cave dwelling alone, and within, he experienced constant shocks. The cold and stern expression on his face finally revealed a hint of astonishment.
He had witnessed the madness of this woman among the outer sect disciples, and he found it quite enjoyable. Luckily, he had refrained from acting impulsively.
"If Senior Ji cannot return, I will help you deal with this person. When she evaporates from this world, the sect will not find a trace."
"Congratulations to Senior Ji on successfully building the foundation, but it's better to resolve enmities than to create them. She's just a Foundation Building stage female disciple. Why put yourself in a dangerous situation? As cultivators in the Foundation Building stage, we should adhere to sect rules!"
Ji Kun kept hearing Chen Xun's words echoing in his mind. The shock in his eyes grew more intense, and even his pupils trembled continuously. That innocent junior who always smiled and led a black ox...
"Hehe, I must have been overthinking. Junior Brother Chen Xun is so pure, Ji Kun, Ji Kun."
Ji Kun shook his head, sighing. He had let his imagination run wild, perhaps from spending too much time among the outer sect disciples. He had even pictured the most important person in his heart as someone else.
Slap!
He gave himself a harsh slap, berating himself. Chen Xun was the last piece of pure land in his heart, untainted by anyone, not even himself.
But seeing the miserable end of this woman, he breathed out a sigh of relief. Now, he had joined Elder Li's faction and made life uncomfortable for Elder Dai every day.
Because of his apology and the fact that he had never paid attention to that woman, Elder Dai had never targeted him.
Ji Kun couldn't help but feel that Chen Xun's words were becoming more and more accurate. Indeed, he had eliminated a significant source of trouble.
He held a voice transmission talisman in his hand and headed towards the sect's medicinal herb garden.
...
Today, Chen Xun was absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth when the light on the voice transmission talisman on his body suddenly flashed. He slowly opened his eyes, revealing a faint smile. It seemed that Senior Ji had resolved all the troubles.
He personally brought Ji Kun to the cave dwelling in the medicinal herb garden. Ji Kun was also impressed by the picturesque scenery and felt relieved to see how content Chen Xun and the black ox were living.
They chatted a lot, recounting the experiences of the past half-year. However, the matter involving that woman was never mentioned.
With wide eyes, the black ox listened, discovering the dangerous areas outside the sect and even the existence of evil cultivators.
Chen Xun also found it extremely enjoyable, and laughter echoed in the cave dwelling.
Ji Kun, initially serious, couldn't help but be amused by them. The exceptionally dangerous incidents, when recounted by Junior Brother Chen, somehow lost their edge.
For example, do evil cultivators really use cultivators for cultivation? What do they look like? Do they eat spiritual beasts? Do they always wear black robes and laugh sinisterly? A series of strange questions.
The big black ox, with a horrified expression, listened intently. He put his ox head on Chen Xun, but curiosity kept showing in his eyes—he wanted to hear more.
Then they went to the contribution hall together. The two of them were not pretending; they exchanged all the items for array materials for the big black ox. If it weren't for Chen Xun stopping him, Ji Kun would have used up all his contributions.
But in front of others, the two adhered to the sect rules. The stronger one took the lead, and Chen Xun was the senior, while Ji Kun was the junior, giving no one a handle.
However, in Ji Kun's heart, Chen Xun and the black ox would always be his junior brothers. They were not good at fighting, and if anything happened, he would risk his life to ensure their safety.
Even on the South Dipper Mountain trip years ago, Ji Kun always believed that they had good luck and didn't obtain their gains through fighting. Every twenty years during the South Dipper Mountain trip, there would always be people like them in various sects.
