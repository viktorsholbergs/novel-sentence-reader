Minghui had barely managed to shout out his curses when the golden temple began to sway and tremble all over, emanating waves of mana light. His expression immediately turned to one of terror, knowing that the Golden Core Realm cultivator he had connected with must have been able to hear him.
He hurriedly cried out, "Spare me, Senior! Spare me! Minghui is the disciple of Maha Jinlian from the Lotus Sect, which upholds the Dharma Characteristics Dao lineage! Please spare my life and I promise never to set foot on the lake again!"
The golden temple shook for a moment before gradually stabilizing. Minghui performed a deep bow in the air for a long time before he even dared to rise, then flew away.
Minghui tested his newly grown arm and glanced into the golden palace artifact. He saw a dazzling ball of colorful light still floating within, while the severed arm had already turned into a pool of white liquid. The palace rumbled under the strain, and the handsome men and beautiful dancers within were screaming and shouting like ants on a hot pan.
"What a pity!"
These people had been collected by Minghui from all over the northern regions, each with outstanding appearances. He had invested much effort in them, and now they were about to be scorched to death by the colorful light.
Minghui cursed under his breath and said, "Abandon your physical forms and come to my temple! Maha is within reach, once I establish my paradise, there will be plenty of pleasure for you all!"
He then raised the golden palace above his head, opening his mouth wide to reveal his white teeth and pink tongue. His saliva glistened like dewdrops, exuding a faintly exotic fragrance.
He gave a forceful shake, causing fingernail-sized figures to tumble right into his mouth. Minghui's pristine teeth bit down, sending severed limbs and flesh flying everywhere, with crimson trails flowing over his tender lips. The attendants in the temple were overjoyed, however, gladly leaping into his mouth.
After several dozen breaths, Minghui licked his lips, saying in great contentment, "First, I will replenish my vital qi, then return to ask the Maha if I can preserve my golden palace!"
Minghui cast a wary glance in the direction of Mount Lijing, not daring to even think about Li Qinghong. Having narrowly escaped death, he was utterly terrified, thinking to himself, This Li Family must be backed by some venerable figure I've never heard of… I'll have to ask my master about it when I return. I should leave now!
Not until Minghui left, like a defeated dog, did the turmoil finally settle. However, the area beneath Mount Yuting remained blood-stained, with filth all the way from the threshold to the steps. The neighbors worked together to clean up the mess, shivering as they returned to their homes.
Mount Yuting had long been under the An Family's rule, only to fall into the Li Family's hands in recent years. The common people had been accustomed to hard days, and even when the devil cultivator, Murong Xia caused a stir, the deaths of over a hundred people seemed insignificant compared to the better days under the Li Family's rule.
When people encountered each other, they would merely ask who had passed and lament briefly, "Such a pity… we're finally living good days."
Li Yuanjiao threw himself into the various affairs of Mount Wutu while Li Yuanping took over the family matters, gradually becoming busier. He held a vermilion brush and lightly marked the wooden slips on the desk before him.
Innate illness made Li Yuanping appear frail and weak, his eyebrows constantly furrowed as if weighed down by countless heavy burdens that he could not relieve from his shoulders. Even when sitting in the most honored position in the courtyard, he still exuded an air of anxiety.
"This year's harvest is somewhat better, reducing some losses," Li Yuanping mumbled to himself. He glanced at the middle-aged man serving by his side and spoke gently. "Clan Uncle, you have been working in the Clan Affairs Courtyard for many years… As I am new to managing the family, I hope you can guide me."
The elderly man beside him, with sunken eyes and graying temples, looked gaunt and haggard though his clothes were meticulously tidy. This was Li Xiewen, an old man who had managed the household during Li Xuanxuan's rule. He was the son of Li Yesheng and was now nearly fifty years old.
The people from the northern slopes of Mount Dali matured early, marrying and having children by the age of twelve or thirteen, and lived only to their forties or fifties. Li Xiewen, devoid of any cultivation, was at the age where he should have been bedridden, just waiting by the death's door. Years of hard work and dedication had earned him several spirit items to nourish himself, allowing him to maintain a relatively healthy appearance.
However, Li Pingyi's suicide had struck this old man hard, causing him to wither. Although the main family sent people to console him, it symbolized that his lineage had completely faded from the center of power. Li Xiewen, clinging to his position, sought to salvage whatever he could.
Upon hearing Li Yuanping's inquiry, Li Xiewen quickly responded modestly, "I have worked in the Clan Affairs Courtyard for many years and merely have a keen ear… I wouldn't dare to give guidance."
Li Yuanping waved his hand, and the old man began, "Currently, there are only three among the non-main lineage Qi Cultivators in the family practicing authentic techniques—An Zheyan at the seventh heavenly layer of the Qi Cultivation Realm, Chen Donghe at the fourth heavenly layer, and Tian Youdao at the first heavenly layer. As for the unrefined Qi Cultivators, there are Li Qiuyang and Old Master Ren. Unrefined Qi Cultivators merely hold the title of Qi Cultivators and are not worth consideration. Additionally, there are two at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, three at the fifth stage, ten at the fourth stage, and a hundred and fifteen minor cultivators below that stage… mostly useless old fellows."
Li Yuanping nodded slightly. Li Xiewen continued, "The Clan Affairs Courtyard has two Embryonic Breathing Realms cultivators at the fifth stage and three at the fourth stage, with countless scouts below the fourth stage and among mortals. Though the family has many external cultivators, only a few are worth noting."
Li Yuanping offered him a seat and had the servants serve tea, then said, "I appreciate your advice, Clan Uncle."
Li Xiewen thanked him, his expression calm. His voice still held deep respect when he continued on.
"The most powerful is Madam Dou of the Dou Family, at the peak of the Embryonic Breathing Realm, with many followers. Though the Dou Family lacks a prestigious name, it possesses substantial influence, owning private spirit fields and forming connections, exhibiting great power."
Li Yuanping moved the tea on the desk, staring quietly at Li Xiewen who was oblivious to his gaze. Li Xiewen simply shook his head and pointed to Dou Yi who sat below, who immediately shrank back and looked as if he wanted to crawl into the ground right then and there.
"As you can see, the Dou Family has already placed people around the young master."
Li Yuanping laughed, then replied, "I am already aware of the Dou Family."
Dou Yi, who was sitting below, possessed cultivation himself. However, when in front of Madam Dou and Li Yuanping, he cowered. Now, being pointed at and criticized by an old mortal man, he felt a surge of anger in his heart. He raised his head cautiously, only to meet Li Yuanping's direct gaze, and lowered his head hastily again.
Li Xiewen nodded silently and cupped his fist, saying, "The Chen Family relies on Chen Donghe, who has always been the foremost among the prestigious families and respected by all. Old Master Chen keeps a low profile and never flaunts his influence. However, the Chen Family has a young disciple named Chen Mufeng, who is seventeen years old and already at the fourth stage of the Embryonic Breathing Realm. He is a disciple of Li Qiuyang, with excellent talent and great potential for promotion."
"I see," Li Yuanping responded with a broad smile and nodded.
The old man with a face full of wrinkles continued softly, "As for the other families, the Tian Family is scattered, the Liu Family is in decline, the Xu Family has few offspring, and the Ren Family's various branches are not in harmony. Only a few people, like Tian Zhongqing and Xu Gongming, are worth noticing; the rest are mediocre and of little use."
Li Yuanping, suddenly coming to an understanding of the matter, nodded again and asked a few more questions about the family's affairs. He then grasped Li Xiewen's hand and said earnestly, "I am young and inexperienced. I truly hope that Clan Uncle can guide me more in family matters."
Li Xiewen naturally agreed repeatedly and soon took his leave. Li Yuanping sat back down, his pale fingers picking up the jade cup on the desk. He looked at Dou Yi below and smiled. "Uncle Xiewen managed the household under my father for many years. It is a pity his health is declining, or I would have entrusted him with significant responsibilities."
He then picked up the wooden slips to read carefully, having just sent off Li Xiewen, when a clan soldier interrupted him with a report.
"Young Master, Madam has arrived."
