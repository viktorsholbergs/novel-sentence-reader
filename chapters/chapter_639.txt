Jiang Heqian sighed and glanced at Li Ximing. Suddenly, Li Ximing's curiosity was piqued, and he asked, "There is one question that troubles me. Back then, what happened to Fei Wangbai?"
"Wangbai?" Jiang Heqian took a few steps and seated himself at the head of the table. Picking up a teacup, he replied lightly, "Naturally, he was killed by an immortal sect."
"Which sect, if I may ask?" Li Ximing paused, his confusion evident.
Jiang Heqian immediately cursed, "How would I know? Do you think immortal sects are trustworthy? Even Yue Cultivating Sect—if their interests were threatened, they would kill without hesitation!"
Jiang Heqian continued, "Wangbai had a Shared Dao with Daoist Master Shangyuan of Yue Cultivating Sect. Yue Cultivating Sect has an alchemy technique that could refine him to nourish Shangyuan. Azure Pond Sect was bound to want him dead eventually!"
Jiang Heqian gave Li Ximing a sideways glance, and before he could respond, Jiang Heqian spoke casually, "But what about your Li Family? With your connection to the Bright Yang Dao Lineage, why did Li Tongya choose to cultivate Pit Water?"
Li Ximing replied evenly, "At the time, our family had fallen into decline. Cultivation resources were scarce, so he had no choice but to pursue Pit Water."
Jiang Heqian paused briefly, having only mentioned the topic in passing. Hearing Li Ximing's response, he felt no need to engage further in meaningless chatter and continued, "Since your esteemed family killed Yu Muxian, did you obtain the Foundation Establishment Realm artifact, Jade Smoke Mountain? After all, it was once an heirloom of my clan. If it is in your possession, I would like to offer an exchange."
Li Ximing shook his head and replied, "You misunderstand, senior. That person died within the grotto heaven but did not bring the artifact with him. It is likely still on Yuanwu Peak."
Jiang Heqian stroked his beard. Realizing the artifact's whereabouts were still uncertain, he sighed and asked, "The Yu Family is now scattered. Has your family made any follow-up arrangements?"
Li Ximing avoided delving too deeply into the matter and replied politely, "Such trivial matters hardly warrant troubling you, senior. Our elders have made appropriate arrangements."
Jiang Heqian chuckled and said, "Let me offer a word of advice, for the sake of old ties. Be cautious. The downfall of my family is still a recent memory. If another Jiang Family were to rise here, without earning the trust of Azure Pond Sect or Golden Feather Sect, it would surely be destined to splinter into pieces!"
His expression carried a hint of mockery, and his tone felt more like ridicule. Li Ximing found it difficult to respond and simply fist cupped in acknowledgment.
After a brief pause, Jiang Heqian continued softly, "I mean the trust of Azure Pond Sect, not Yuan Su. How much longer does Yuan Su have to live? He cannot secure anything for you!"
With a flick of his sleeve, Jiang Heqian threw out this statement, seeming to lose interest in the conversation. Lowering his gaze, he said, "Revenge has been served. The Yu Family's blood feud has been repaid in full. I will spend the rest of my days wandering the world. I will not return to the lakes. The Jiang Family is but a wisp of smoke now, and this matter ends here."
With that, he stepped out of the courtyard. As if remembering something, he retrieved an item from his storage pouch.
It was round and heavy, with black hair cascading down—a severed head. The eyes were clouded gray, the skin taut, and the mouth slightly ajar, revealing a dark, gaping void.
"This is Yu Mugao's head," he said, tossing it onto the ground before departing on the wind.
Li Ximing picked up the head and gave it a quiet glance. Yu Mugao had once sparred with Li Yuanjiao and others in secret, but this was the fate he had met. He gave instructions, "Take this to the elders and An Zheyan for them to see. Let it ease their grievances. Then, bring it to my uncle's grave as an offering to our ancestors."
Li Wushao bowed and carried the head away. Li Ximing, meanwhile, adjusted his robes and returned to his chambers to resume his secluded cultivation.
Yu Mugao's head was passed around among the clan members. Some wept, others laughed. For most of the elders, it was a moment of catharsis. However, none were as emotional as An Zheyan, who shed hot tears.
After it had made its rounds, Li Xuanxuan hurried down and took the head up the mountain.
Li Yuanxiu's death had been one of the greatest sorrows of Li Xuanxuan's life. Though he had endured much suffering, his hatred had not diminished—it had only deepened over time.
It was like his left eye, scarred by demonic flames. Though it caused no pain on ordinary days, when he squinted, it burned with a searing heat, a constant reminder that his wounds remained unhealed.
Li Yuexiang accompanied the old man up the mountain, watching as he spoke quietly to the gravestone. The severed head sat on the altar, motionless and silent.
Li Yuexiang stayed with him for half a day. Only when someone came up the mountain to summon her did she prepare to leave. Looking closely, she saw it was Li Wushao.
Li Wushao kneeled on one knee and said softly, "Miss, someone from the Yuan Family has arrived."
Li Yuexiang had no choice but to leave the graveyard. She descended the mountain and flew to the central hall of Lijing Town. Outside the hall stood a line of attendants. Before she even entered, she could already hear Li Chengliao's voice, "Senior, you are being too polite! There is no need for this!"
As she stepped inside, she saw two attendants at the rear and two individuals standing at the front.
One was an elderly man with neatly combed white hair, tall and imposing, with the cultivation level of an early-stage Foundation Establishment Realm. He looked to be about 180 years old and wore a beaming smile.
The man was speaking earnestly, saying, "Do not say such things. Even this Foundation Establishment Realm cultivation of mine is thanks to Nephew Yuanjiao! Not to mention the Essence Gathering Pill he gave me, even the idea of breaking through was inspired by him!"
Li Yuexiang's arrival interrupted their conversation. Li Chengliao quickly stepped forward with a smile and said, "Aunt, you are here! This is Senior Yuan Huyuan and Young Master Yuan Fuyao."
The speaker was Yuan Huyuan, who had broken through to Foundation Establishment Realm at the age of 100. Though his success was largely due to the Essence Gathering Pill, it was undeniably a stroke of luck. The elderly man now appeared decades younger, radiating the demeanor of a high cultivator who had achieved the Dao.
As for the young man standing behind him, he was strikingly handsome, tall, and wore a calm expression. Draped in luxurious robes, he carried an air of nobility.
Given that Yuan Chengdun was already quite good-looking, Yuan Fuyao naturally inherited these traits. Among cultivators, his appearance was exceptional. Li Yuexiang glanced at him briefly and noticed the astonishment in his eyes as he looked at her.
Several chests of spirit treasures were displayed in the hall, indicating that Yuan Huyuan had gone to great lengths to show the importance of this visit.
Li Yuexiang responded politely, and Yuan Huyuan's joy was evident as he eagerly approached, speaking in a low voice, "I had some connections with your father… It is a pity what happened to you…"
Li Yuexiang, accustomed to such comments, quickly shifted the topic and turned her attention to Yuan Fuyao. Yuan Huyuan immediately began introducing him, saying some flattering words. Just then, another figure arrived.
The newcomer was an elderly man with white hair, hurrying in. It was Li Xuanxuan, whose aged voice carried a trace of apology. "I deeply apologize, Senior. All the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators in the family are currently in seclusion. Qinghong has gone to the Eastern Sea, so only a Qi Cultivator like me was available to greet you."
Yuan Huyuan waved his hand dismissively and replied, "It is no bother at all! With someone of your stature coming to receive me, it is already a great honor. Why should there be any formality between our two families?"
Their conversation was warm and friendly, full of mutual politeness, leaving Li Yuexiang and Yuan Fuyao awkwardly standing to the side. Seeing this, Li Xicheng smiled and said, "Yuexiang, why not take the young master to enjoy the lake scenery?"
The two left together, and only then did Yuan Huyuan's smile fade, his expression turning serious as he said, "Are you aware of the current state of my family?"
Li Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment before answering, "I know a bit."
