Chapter 39: Junior Brother, Do You Know That Our Sect is a Righteous Sect?
Translator: yikaii Editor: yikaii
“Of course, not everything can be treated as a mission. The three types of tasks I mentioned earlier all have one prerequisite: defending the righteous path.”
“Coincidentally, Brother Barbaric Bone has discovered a suitable mission for us. It’s too challenging for him to handle alone, so he has called upon both of us.”
Barbaric Bone nodded in agreement, not saying much, truly embodying the modesty of a refined gentleman.
“When shall we depart?” Lu Yang asked.
“How about early tomorrow morning?” Meng Jingzhou proposed.
This was exactly what Lu Yang wanted. He planned to visit the mission hall before departure to exchange some items, feeling eager to use his accumulated contribution points.
…
“Iced Gourd: the water inside cools down quickly, offering a refreshing drink, perfect for those who enjoy cold water. Three contribution points.”
“Multifunctional Swiss Knife: includes an earpick, nail cutter, marker pen, compass, and other tools. Essential for outdoor activities. Ten contribution points.”
“Vajra Dragon Blood Knife: once a demonic cultivator’s treasure, activated by dragon blood to enhance its bloodthirsty nature, and suppressed by Buddhist Vajra techniques to contain its ferocity. It slices through flesh and bone effortlessly. Now, its demonic aura has been thoroughly eradicated, and its ferocity is completely suppressed, though its sharpness is slightly reduced. Three hundred contribution points.”
“Fragment of the Moksha Heart Technique: a remnant of a self-immolated ascetic’s heart technique, believed to be his original creation. The complete version is untraceable. This fragment helps in quickly achieving a deep meditative state by controlling the restless mind. Fifteen hundred contribution points.”
Lu Yang browsed through several items but found none to his liking, so he asked the senior brother on duty for recommendations.
“Senior Brother, I will be venturing out for training tomorrow and am looking to purchase some self-defense items. Do you have any suggestions?”
The senior brother, a tall and burly man with a face covered in horizontal scars, looked intimidating enough to scare children. He seemed like someone who would be targeted by righteous heroes.
The senior brother glanced at Lu Yang, feeling unfamiliar with him, then realized Lu Yang was a newly recruited junior brother.
Realizing that he was finally being addressed as ‘Senior Brother’, his expression softened a bit.
After so many years, he was no longer the lowest-ranked disciple.
“How many contribution points and spirit stones do you plan to use?”
“Three hundred contribution points, no spirit stones.”
“I am Li Dan; you can address me as Brother Li. You’re at the early stage of Foundation Building, so the items you can use aren’t very high level, and they won’t cost too many contribution points.”
Despite his fierce appearance, Li Dan was actually a very warm-hearted man.
Brother Li skillfully scrolled through the exchange list, introducing various protective items: “The Hundred Battles Heart Protector Mirror, worn over the chest, can withstand a full-force attack from a peak Foundation Building cultivator. Only two hundred contribution points.”
Just as Lu Yang was considering whether to buy a life-saving item, he heard a timid voice: “Junior Brother Lu, actually, you don’t need to buy the Heart Protector Mirror here. The sesame cakes in the cafeteria can also withstand a full-force attack from a peak Foundation Building cultivator, and they’re even cheaper.”
The voice grew fainter, almost inaudible, like the buzzing of a mosquito. Had Lu Yang not been at the Foundation Building stage with heightened senses, he wouldn’t have heard it.
“Sister Zhou Lulu?” Lu Yang was surprised to encounter Zhou Lulu here.
During his first month in the sect, he spent time in the scripture library, asking her for help whenever he had questions. After being confined to Heaven’s Gate Peak for cultivation by Yunzhi, he hadn’t seen her for a year.
“Senior Sister.” Li Dan, only one level above Lu Yang, also addressed Zhou Lulu as ‘Senior Sister.’
“Yes, it’s me.” Zhou Lulu’s nervousness was visibly evident as she spoke. She had just completed a mission and came to exchange her rewards, happening to run into Lu Yang.
“You guys continue, I was just making a small suggestion, nothing else.” Zhou Lulu tried to make herself less noticeable, planning to wait until Lu Yang had finished his exchanges.
Both men ignored Zhou Lulu.
“This is the Mountain Crushing Hammer. With a single strike, it causes a vibration effect, disrupting the rhythm of formation and talisman cultivators. It’s somewhat effective against such opponents, but those proficient in formations and talismans have firm wills and can adjust their rhythm even under disturbance, so the hammer’s effectiveness is somewhat reduced. Two hundred and seventy contribution points.”
Lu Yang nodded. This seemed like a useful item, especially since he might encounter formation and talisman opponents.
Aside from cultivators who had immersed themselves in these arts for decades, the Mountain Crushing Hammer was effective.
Senior Sister Zhou Lulu muttered softly, “The cafeteria’s fried dough sticks also have a similar effect.”
Both men pretended not to hear.
“Brother Li, do we have any items suitable for ambush?”
Brother Li replied seriously, “Junior Brother, do you know that our sect is a righteous one?”
“So?”
“You should ask that question quietly.”
Lu Yang nodded in understanding.
Brother Li pressed down on the list and scrolled rapidly, timing his selection perfectly, and continued introducing: “This is the Jade Shattering Needle, thin as a cow’s hair and extremely sharp when imbued with spiritual energy. It can penetrate protective barriers but is difficult to master and expensive.”
“This is the Qimen Spike. When facing a powerful enemy, take a handful and throw it towards their seven orifices for a surprise attack. Easy to use and reasonably priced.”
Lu Yang nodded. This item was indeed inexpensive and seemed quite valuable for its price.
“The cafeteria’s rice is more useful than this.” Senior Sister Zhou Lulu reminded.
Brother Li could no longer tolerate Zhou Lulu’s whispers. He turned around abruptly, startling her.
Zhou Lulu bowed her head, not daring to look at Li Dan’s scarred face. She had no intention of causing trouble, but the cafeteria’s items were genuinely useful. She wanted to recommend them directly to Lu Yang but was too shy.
Seeing Zhou Lulu’s reaction, Li Dan realized she meant no harm and softened his tone: “Senior Sister Zhou, I know you’re from Hundred Refinements Peak, but you shouldn’t harm a new junior brother just to drum up business for Hundred Refinements Peak!”
“And think about it, Junior Brother Lu. Aside from the cafeteria food being cost-effective, sturdy, multifunctional, usable as both a weapon and food, what other benefits are there?”
Lu Yang: “…”
Aren’t these benefits enough?
Li Dan thought about it and realized that aside from not being designed for combat, the cafeteria food indeed had no drawbacks.
“Why don’t you, Senior Sister Zhou, take Junior Brother Lu to the cafeteria for a tour?”
Zhou Lulu’s eyes lit up, and she quickly dragged Lu Yang towards the cafeteria.
Lu Yang realized that Senior Sister Zhou had incredible strength, unable to break free from her grasp. He wondered what her cultivation level was.
“Senior Sister Zhou, you’re from Hundred Refinements Peak?”
Hundred Refinements Peak, under the fifth elder, served both as a weapon forging and cafeteria department, often blending the two functions.
“Yes, I’m a disciple of Hundred Refinements Peak.”
“But I often see you reading in the scripture library, and not about weapon forging?”
Lu Yang couldn’t help but be curious. Shouldn’t disciples of Hundred Refinements Peak be learning weapon forging?
