On Yuanwu Peak, aside from the Daoist Master Yuanwu himself, Yu Muxian was currently the highest-ranking figure. He merely nodded in acknowledgment to the greetings as he continued his ascent, passing through the mountain to the cave dwelling at its peak, where he waited silently outside the stone door.
After a few moments, the door creaked open, and Yu Muxian stepped inside. The cave was ablaze with golden light, dazzling and blinding him. Heat was surging from the ground.
Yu Muxian lowered his head in reverence and spoke softly, "Greetings, Master."
The figure before him, obscured by a shimmering golden aura, spoke in a deep, resounding voice.
"Muxian... Not bad... you are already at the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm."
Daoist Yuanwu sounded extremely pleased, and after a brief pause, he softened his tone.
"I see you have refined both your spells, techniques, and cultivation. I've summoned you today to send you on a trip to the Eastern Sea."
Yu Muxian disliked these mundane matters the most. He longed only to seclude himself on the peak until he reached the Purple Mansion Realm.
However, since Daoist Master Yuanwu had a personal request, he had no grounds to refuse. With a respectful voice, he replied, "Please tell me more about it, Master."
Daoist Master Yuanwu seemed to have anticipated his thoughts. His voice echoed through the cave, vast and resonant.
"I know you are focused on your cultivation, but this matter concerns your future Dao path. There are also several items I wish to obtain, and you are the only one under my command capable of handling this task."
Yu Muxian, who believed his cultivation technique could reach all the way to the Purple Mansion Realm without an issue, wasn't entirely convinced that this mission had anything to do with his Dao path. He considered it more likely to be an excuse from his master to send him on this journey.
"Go to Green Pine Temple. Tang Shedu is already waiting for you in the Eastern Sea. He has also reached the late stage of the Foundation Establishment Realm and has made friends with a fate bearer. You will follow him into the grotto heaven."
Yu Muxian nodded, responding with a question, "What is the background of this grotto heaven? What is it that you seek from there, Master?"
Daoist Master Yuanwu chuckled softly, causing the golden light in the cave to flicker slightly.
"Green Pine Grotto Heaven belongs to an ancient Dao lineage known as Green Pine Temple. Through the ebb and flow of time, Green Pine Immortal Temple has risen and fallen three times since the primordial era. Now, the grotto heaven stands as the legacy of the last Green Pine Dao lineage," he explained.
Yu Muxian's understanding began to take shape, and he responded quietly, "The Chunyi Dao?"
"Correct. The Chunyi Dao claims itself to be the descendant of the Green Pine Temple Dao lineage. If you encounter them within the grotto heaven, be extremely cautious," Yuanwu replied.
The golden light in the cave shifted as Yuanwu repeated, "I want you to retrieve three items from the grotto heaven. If the opportunities present themselves, be sure to bring them back. I will reward you accordingly."
He began, "The first item is the Sun Seeker Ring. Your senior brother obtained this ring from the sea, but he never had the chance to study it in detail before he was killed by Guo Er from Crimson Reef Island. Guo Er probably could not recognize the ring, and it disappeared on Green Pine Island, where he died. The relic is now somewhere within the grotto heaven."
Yuanwu then conjured an image in his hand—a small golden-red ring. Yu Muxian memorized its appearance as Yuanwu continued explaining, "The second item is the Unspeaking Bell, a powerful spirit treasure. It would be great if you could obtain it, but don't worry if you can't."
Another image appeared in Yuanwu's hand—an ancient, majestic-looking stone bell, with two strange talisman runes carved into it.
He allowed Yu Muxian a moment to memorize its appearance before continuing, "As for the last item... If you and the others manage to enter the Three Drums Hall within the grotto heaven and find legacy techniques, record one of them for me. It is the one that goes with the Grave Gate Thorn immortal foundation.
Upon hearing that, Yu Muxian's interest was finally piqued as he hurriedly asked, "Master, regarding the legacy techniques… do we get to pick?"
"Yes," Daoist Master Yuanwu replied, as if he had anticipated Yu Muxian's question.
"The Dao partner cultivation techniques to your Molten Metal Cave are among them. I heard that three out of five are ancient techniques. Whether the specific qi required can still be gathered or not will depend on your luck."
A sincere joy finally appeared on Yu Muxian's face. The Azure Pond Sect did not possess the Dao partner of his Molten Metal Cave, so he never would have expected he could find one within this heaven grotto.
His excitement surged as he nodded and said, "Thank you, Master!"
Master Yuanwu nodded gently, pausing for a moment before adding, "This grotto heaven is very dangerous, and you will need spirit treasures to protect yourself on this journey."
With a wave of his hand, two spirit treasures flew out from his sleeve. One was a golden ring, no thicker than a pinky finger but large enough to fit a head. It was engraved with many runes.
The second was an ordinary-looking short sword, with two lines of patterns engraved into the handle. It floated gently in the air, appearing unremarkable.
"Binding Ring and Cloudsunder," Yuanwu said.
Yu Muxian, who had been by Yuanwu's side for years, instantly recognized the treasures. Both were Purple Mansion Realm spirit treasures—extremely rare and valuable.
Daoist Master Yuanwu had crafted them only several years ago, so they had not been properly nurtured or refined by metallic essence. As a result, they were far less potent than those treasures that had been carefully nurtured for many years by other Purple Mansion Realm Daoist Masters. Nevertheless, they were still precious Purple Mansion Realm spirit treasures.
Yu Muxian instantly kneeled, putting on a hesitant look on his face as he said, "Master, I cannot accept such precious spirit treasures! I couldn't possibly bear the responsibility of losing them out there!"
Yuanwu laughed.
"Haha! Who would dare take them? The only ones in that grotto heaven are Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. They won't be able to defeat you. Besides, which Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator in their right mind would dare take these treasures?"
"Once you're out of the grotto heaven, they will return to me through the great void. You don't have to worry about anything," he assured.
Yu Muxian nodded and replied softly, "I understand."
The light around Daoist Yuanwu's body glowed slightly brighter as he continued, "Ning Tiaoxiao has sent someone named Li Xuanfeng over. I heard that he's a member of the Li Family from Moongaze Lake. You should befriend him since you're from the same sect. There are many benefits to joining forces."
Yu Muxian nodded and quietly exited the cave dwelling. As he walked, his thoughts wandered.
Li Xuanfeng has become the son-in-law of the Ning Family huh… Well, that small grudge between our clans is nothing. I don't mind talking with him.
As for these... I'm probably the only one among the sects who get to carry two Purple Mansion Realm spirit treasures like this. I have to say, this mission is a good opportunity... I'll try to find a few more treasures and cultivation techniques to bring home…
Meanwhile, Daoist Master Yuanwu remained in his seat within the cave dwelling. The light radiating from his body continued to intensify. The cave dwelling was so silent that one could hear a pin drop.
"Green Pine Temple can bridge the gap of Dao lineages, huh? Things are really getting lively. We may even see people from the north... The True Monarchs are likely keeping an eye on this, hoping to find the real heir of the immortal temple…" he mumbled.
The items among the Green Pine Temple Ruins were attractive to the Foundation Establishment Realm cultivators. To the Purple Mansion Realm cultivators, they merely supplemented a few Dao lineages. As for the True Monarchs, they were only interested in those who could truly receive the legacy of the grotto heaven.
"Yuansu... Yuanxiu... Zipei... Tiandong... When the winds of change swept through, a dozen or so rode the tide, but now only a few of them remain. Their lifespan is dwindling, so they must be getting anxious," he murmured.
He gazed in the direction Yu Muxian had gone, his golden pupils shifting slightly.
"Whether it's too late or not, we'll have to try…"
